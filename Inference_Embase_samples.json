Identification of primary tumors and metastasis sites is an essential step in cancer diagnostics and the following treatment. Positron emission tomography-computed tomography (PET/CT) is one of the most reliable methods for scanning the whole organism for malignancies. In this work, we synthesized an 11C-labeled oligonucleotide primer and hybridized it to an anti-cancer DNA aptamer. The 11C-aptamer was applied for in vivo imaging of Ehrlich ascites carcinoma and its metastases in mice using PET/CT. The imaging experiments with the 11C-aptamer determined very small primary and secondary tumors of 3 mm2 and less. We also compared 11C imaging with the standard radiotracer, 2-deoxy-2-[fluorine-18]fluoro-D-glucose (18F-FDG), and found better selectivity of the 11C-aptamer to metastatic lesions in the metabolically active organs than 18F-FDG. 11C radionuclide with an ultra-short (20.38 min) half-life is considered safest for PET/CT imaging and does not cause false-positive results in heart imaging. Its combination with aptamers gives us high-specificity and high-contrast imaging of cancer cells and can be applied for PET/CT-guided drug delivery in cancer therapies.",

Objectives: The aim of this analysis was to assess long-term clinical outcomes of the polymer-free Amphilimus-eluting stent (PF-AES) compared with a latest generation permanent-polymer drug-eluting stent (DES) in an all-comers population. Background: PF-AES possess multiple properties improving targeted drug elution without the presence of polymers. Evaluation of long-term clinical performance of PF-AES versus latest generation permanent-polymer DES has not yet been performed in a large randomized trial introducing shortened dual-antiplatelet therapy. Methods: In this physician-initiated, multicenter, randomized, all-comers trial, patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention with implantation of DES were enrolled. Patients were stratified for diabetes and troponin status and randomized to implantation of a permanent-polymer zotarolimus-eluting stent (PP-ZES) or a PF-AES. Dual-antiplatelet therapy duration was 12 months in troponin-positive patients and 1 month in troponin-negative patients. A noninferiority analysis was conducted to compare the 2 arms regarding target lesion failure (TLF) between 1 and 3 years. Results: A total of 1,491 patients were randomized and treated. In this landmark analysis, between 1- and 3-year follow-up, TLF occurred in 35 patients (4.9%) in the PP-ZES arm and 37 PF-AES patients (5.1%). Clinical noninferiority of the PF-AES was confirmed, with a risk difference of 0.2% (upper limit 1-sided 95% CI: 2.2%; Pnoninferiority = 0.0031).

Results: Our search yielded 156 unique legal cases in the Nexis Uni database from April 2003 to May 2021. Only 18 of these cases met the inclusion criteria. Adverse events experienced by patients included medication side effects (n\u00c2\u00a0=\u00c2\u00a012, 66.7%), delayed cancer diagnosis (n\u00c2\u00a0=\u00c2\u00a03, 16.7%), and lack of symptom improvement (n\u00c2\u00a0=\u00c2\u00a03, 16.7%). The identity of the plaintiffs were most commonly patients themselves (n\u00c2\u00a0=\u00c2\u00a015, 83.3%). Defendants include pharmaceutical companies (n\u00c2\u00a0=\u00c2\u00a06, 33.3%), a combination of parties (n\u00c2\u00a0=\u00c2\u00a05, 27.8%), and physicians (n\u00c2\u00a0=\u00c2\u00a05, 27.8%) alone. The allegations included sexual side effects such as erectile dysfunction (n\u00c2\u00a0=\u00c2\u00a06, 33.3%) and decreased libido (n\u00c2\u00a0=\u00c2\u00a04, 22.2%). These prescriptions were made for benign prostatic hyperplasia (n\u00c2\u00a0=\u00c2\u00a09, 50%), male pattern hair loss (n\u00c2\u00a0=\u00c2\u00a07, 38.9%), and feminizing hormone therapy (n\u00c2\u00a0=\u00c2\u00a02, 11.1%). Several of these cases involved the same plaintiffs in related cases. No verdicts were against physicians. We noted a largely settled lawsuit involving more than 1000 plaintiffs with limited data on harms alleged and a $4.3 million settled amount. Of the total cases that resulted in a verdict, 9/18 were within the last 3 years. Discussion: The most common complications experienced by patients in our legal review were those involving sexual dysfunction with erectile dysfunction and decreased libido. The growing number of cases in the later years of our review suggests litigation may continue to increase in the coming future. Our review did not identify any individual cases that resulted in a monetary payout beyond a $4.3 million settlement outside of court. Conclusion: 5\u00ce\u00b1-reductase inhibitor was alleged to have sexual, mental, and physical side effects, resulting in legal litigation. Despite this, no judgment against a physician or pharmaceutical company was identified. We do note and discuss a large number of lawsuits settled out of court. Given the increase in the number of lawsuits resulting in verdicts over the last 3 years, we suspect that the frequency of litigation around 5\u00ce\u00b1-reductase inhibitors will continue for the foreseeable future.",

Background: 7-Hydroxycoumarin (7-HC) as a coumarin compound is widely found in Chinese herbs and exhibits diverse biological activities. Promoting cell apoptosis of fibroblast-like synoviocytes (FLS) is a meaningful strategy for rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Though the protective effect of 7-HC on RA experimental models has been reported, the specific mechanisms, especially the possible relationships of this effect to regulating FLS proliferation and apoptosis, still need clarification. Purpose: This study clarified the therapeutic effects of 7-HC on collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) in rats and explored the underlying mechanisms. Methods: In vivo, 7-HC (15, 30 or 60 mg/kg) was intraperitoneally given to CIA rats, and its therapeutic effect and anti-inflammatory activity were evaluated. Ki67 immunohistochemistry, TUNEL assay and synovial proteins detection were conducted. In vitro, after treating with 7-HC (20, 40 or 80 \u00ce\u00bcM) in TNF-\u00ce\u00b1-stimulated RA FLS (MH7A cell line), cell proliferation and apoptosis were examined. The involvement of Wnt/\u00ce\u00b2-catenin pathway was checked in vivo and in vitro. Results: 7-HC attenuated the severity of rat CIA, evidenced by the reduction of paw swelling, arthritis index, joint damage, collagen type II antibody serum level, and IL-1\u00ce\u00b2, IL-6, TNF-\u00ce\u00b1 production in serum and synovium. Particularly, 7-HC in vivo had anti-proliferative and pro-apoptotic effects on CIA rat synovial cells, indicated by reduced synovial Ki67 expression, raised synovial apoptosis index, decreased Bcl-2 protein level and increased level of Bax and cleaved caspase 3 protein. Further, 7-HC in vitro suppressed proliferation and promoted apoptosis of TNF-\u00ce\u00b1-stimulated MH7A cells by regulating the mitochondrial pathway. Mechanistically, 7-HC treatment inhibited Wnt/\u00ce\u00b2-catenin pathway, suggested by the reduction of pathway-related proteins (e.g. Wnt1, LRP6, p-GSK-3\u00ce\u00b2 (Ser9), \u00ce\u00b2-catenin, cyclin D1 and c-Myc), the recovery of GSK-3\u00ce\u00b2 activity and the inhibition of \u00ce\u00b2-catenin nuclear translocation. As expected, combined use of lithium chloride, an activator of Wnt/\u00ce\u00b2-catenin signaling, reversed the anti-proliferative and pro-apoptotic effects of 7-HC in vitro. Conclusion: 7-HC relieved the severity of rat CIA by inhibiting cell proliferation and inducing apoptosis of rheumatoid FLS via inhibition of Wnt/\u00ce\u00b2-catenin pathway.",

Background: Multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) has recently been described in children infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). This report describes 2 children with MIS-C who were initially diagnosed with toxic shock syndrome but who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection on reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction, supporting the diagnosis of MIS-C. Case Reports: Case 1. A 7-year-old boy with fever, cough, and dyspnea was treated with oxygen, intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) infusion, and methylprednisolone and showed a worsening of clinical conditions, persistent fever, hypotension, and hematological parameters compatible with macrophage activation syndrome (MAS). Three intravenous boluses of methylprednisolone (30 mg/kg/day) were followed by a progressive resolution. Case 2. A 14-year-old girl with syncope, fever, diarrhea, oliguria, and increased creatinine levels required fluid infusion and correction of electrolyte imbalance. The increase of creatine phosphokinase (CPK), myoglobin, troponin, and creatine kinase-MB (CK-MB) was associated with grade I atrioventricular block and pericardial effusion. The patient showed myositis and severe muscular weakness, with hematological parameters compatible with MIS-C. She started IVIG and 3 intravenous boluses of methylprednisolone. However, bradycardia, tachypnea, severe hypotension, loss of consciousness, oliguria, bilateral ground-glass pneumonia, bilateral pleural, and peritoneal effusion, in the absence of thromboembolism, required treatment with furosemide, albumin, and enoxaparin, and was followed by a prompt resolution. Conclusions: These 2 pediatric cases highlight the importance of SARS-CoV-2 testing in all patients with acute symptoms and signs of infection during the COVID-19 pandemic. As new variants of SARS-CoV-2 emerge, cases of MIS-C can become more prevalent, and pediatricians should be aware of diagnostic and management guidelines.",

Dysregulation of cell cycle progression (CCP) is one of the hallmarks of cancer. Here, our study is aimed at developing a CCP-derived gene signature for predicting high-risk population of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Methods. Our study retrospectively analyzed the transcriptome profiling and clinical information of HCC patients from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and International Cancer Genome Consortium (ICGC) projects. Uni- and multivariate cox regression models were conducted for identifying which hallmarks of cancer were risk factors of HCC. CCP-derived gene signature was developed with LASSO method. The predictive efficacy was verified by ROC curves and subgroup analyses. A nomogram was then generated and validated by ROC, calibration, and decisive curves. Immune cell infiltration was estimated with ssGSEA method. Potential small molecular compounds were predicted via CTRP and CMap analyses. The response to chemotherapeutic agents was evaluated based on the GDSC project. Results. Among hallmarks of cancer, CCP was identified as a dominant risk factor for HCC prognosis. CCP-derived gene signature displayed the favorable predictive efficacy in HCC prognosis independent of other clinicopathological parameters. A nomogram was generated for optimizing risk stratification and quantifying risk evaluation. CCP-derived signature was in relation to immune cell infiltration, HLA, and immune checkpoint expression. Combining CTRP and CMap analyses, fluvastatin was identified as a promising therapeutic agent against HCC. Furthermore, CCP-derived signature might be applied for predicting the response to doxorubicin and gemcitabine. Conclusion. Collectively, CCP-derived gene signature was a promising marker in prediction of survival outcomes and therapeutic responses for HCC patients.\n",

Background: Depression is a clinical syndrome that is characterised by a cluster of emotional, behavioural, and cognitive features. Depression also poses a significant economic burden to society as it leads to reduced productivity, treatment costs and loss of human life by suicide. Aims and Objectives: To compare the efficacy and safety of newer antidepressants like Escitalopram and Desvenlafaxine versus conventional antidepressant like Imipramine in patients with Depressive episode. Material and Methods: An open label, prospective, comparative study was conducted in the Department of Pharmacology, Sri Krishna Medical College (SKMC), Muzaffarpur, Bihar associated with psychiatry outpatient department (OPD), Sri Krishna Medical College and Hospital (SKMCH), Muzaffarpur, Bihar during last 3 months. Results: 72 newly diagnosed patients of depressive episode according to ICD-10 criteria were divided into three groups of 24 each receiving Imipramine (Group A), Escitalopram (Group B) and Desvenlafaxine (Group C) and followed up for 6 weeks. Efficacy measurement was reduction in MADRS, CGI-S and CGI-I scores. Safety assessment was by number, severity and dropouts due to adverse drug reactions and laboratory investigations. Data was analyzed using ANOVA and Chi square test. Response rate was 51% in Group B, 43% in Group A and 40% in Group C, but this difference was not statistically significant. Initial response was seen as early as 2 weeks in 51% in group B and 40% in group C but none in group A and showed statistical significance.

The purpose of this prospective double-blinded positive control study was to compare the efficacy of 2.5% polyacrylamide hydrogel (2.5% PAAG) in the management of middle carpal joint lameness in Thoroughbreds against treatments of triamcinolone acetonide (TA) or sodium hyaluronate (HA). A total of 31 flat-racing Thoroughbreds with lameness (grade 1-3/5) localized to the carpus by intra-articular analgesia were selected. Following a radiological assessment of the carpi confirming the absence of fragment/fracture, the horses were randomly assigned for intra-articular treatment with either 2 ml of 2.5% PAAG, 12 mg TA or 20 mg HA (followed by two further intravenous treatments of 40 mg, at weekly intervals in the HA group only), by a treating veterinarian. All horses were rested for 48 hours post-treatment and then re-entered an unaltered training regimen. Subsequent examinations at 2, 4, and 6 weeks were performed by a blinded examining veterinarian for all groups, while horses treated with 2.5% PAAG were monitored for 12 weeks for recurrence of lameness.

Background: Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is an important means by which to study the urine microbiome and is emerging as possible alternative to urine cultures to identify pathogens that cause urinary tract infection (UTI). However, PCR is limited by its inability to differentiate DNA originating from viable, metabolically active versus non-viable, inactive bacteria. This drawback has led to concerns that urobiome studies and PCR-based diagnosis of UTI are confounded by the presence of relic DNA from non-viable bacteria in urine. Propidium monoazide (PMA) dye can penetrate cells with compromised cell membranes and covalently bind to DNA, rendering it inaccessible to amplification by PCR. Although PMA has been shown to differentiate between non-viable and viable bacteria in various settings, its effectiveness in urine has not been previously studied. We sought to investigate the ability of PMA to differentiate between viable and non-viable bacteria in urine. Methods: Varying amounts of viable or non-viable uropathogenic E. coli (UTI89) or buffer control were titrated with mouse urine. The samples were centrifuged to collect urine sediment or not centrifuged. Urine samples were incubated with PMA and DNA cross-linked using blue LED light. DNA was isolated and uidA gene-specific PCR was performed. For in vivo studies, mice were inoculated with UTI89, followed by ciprofloxacin treatment or no treatment. After the completion of ciprofloxacin treatment, an aliquot of urine was plated on non-selective LB agar and another aliquot was treated with PMA and subjected to uidA-specific PCR. Results: PMA\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s efficiency in excluding DNA signal from non-viable bacteria was significantly higher in bacterial samples in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS, dCT=13.69) versus bacterial samples in unspun urine (dCT=1.58). This discrepancy was diminished by spinning down urine-based bacterial samples to collect sediment and resuspending it in PBS prior to PMA treatment. In 3 of 5 replicate groups of UTI89-infected mice, no bacteria grew in culture; however, there was PCR amplification of E. coli after PMA treatment in 2 of those 3 groups. Conclusion: We have successfully developed PMA-based PCR methods for amplifying DNA from live bacteria in urine. Our results suggest that non-PMA bound DNA from live bacteria can be present in urine, even after antibiotic treatment. This indicates that viable but non-culturable E. coli can be present following treatment of UTI, and may explain why some patients have persistent symptoms but negative urine cultures following UTI treatment.",

Purpose: Single agent PD-1 inhibitors have yielded durable responses in a minority of gastroesophageal cancers. Radiation therapy has been recognized to promote antitumor immune responses and may synergize with anti-PD-1 agents. We sought to evaluate if combining palliative radiation therapy with pembrolizumab can augment antitumor immune responses in gastroesophageal cancer. Methods and Materials: Patients had metastatic gastroesophageal cancer with indication for palliative radiation therapy with \u00e2\u2030\u00a52 disease sites outside of the radiation field assessable for abscopal response and biopsies for laboratory correlative analyses. Palliative radiation was delivered to a dose of 30 Gy over 10 fractions. Pembrolizumab, 200 mg, was administered concurrently intravenously every 3 weeks until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or study withdrawal, for up to 2 years. Endpoints included PD-L1 expression in pre- and posttreatment biopsies and abscopal objective response rate per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors. Results: Of 14 enrolled patients, the objective response rate was 28.6% (95% confidence interval, 8.4%-58.1%), and the median duration of response was not reached (95% confidence interval, 6.9-NR months). Overall, 2 patients had treatment-related grade 3 to 4 adverse events with no grade 5 events. One patient discontinued therapy due to grade 4 colitis. We did not observe an association between radiation and abscopal changes in PD-L1 expression via assessment of an analogous PD-L1 Combined Positive Score, Tumor Proportion Score, Mononuclear Immune Cell Density Score, or proportion of PD-L1-expressing immune cells between pre- and posttreatment tumor biopsies. Conclusions: Combining palliative radiation therapy and pembrolizumab provided promising durable responses in this patient population but we were unable to definitively distinguish abscopal biologic changes. Biomarker analyses beyond PD-L1 expression are needed to better understand putative mechanisms and identify patients who will benefit from this approach.",

Introduction: Inhaled therapeutics may act to directly target and attenuate lung inflammation due to COVID-19. An inhalation form of a novel biologic drug, AMP5A, is being developed as an immunomodulatory agent to treat dysregulated immune responses and is being studied in hospitalized patients to treat respiratory complications due to COVID-19. Methods: A randomized, controlled, phase I trial was conducted to evaluate hospitalized adults with respiratory distress secondary to COVID-19. Patients received the standard care (SOC) for COVID-19, including respiratory therapy, corticosteroids, and antiviral therapies such as remdesivir. Patients were randomized 1:1 to inhalation treatment with AMP5A as an adjunct to SOC or to SOC alone (control). AMP5A was administered via inhalation daily for 5 days via hand-held nebulizer, non-invasive ventilator, or mechanical ventilation. Safety and clinical efficacy endpoints were evaluated. Results: Forty subjects were enrolled and randomized (n = 19 AMP5A, n = 21 control). Remdesivir was used in fewer AMP5A subjects (26%) than control (52%), and dexamethasone was administered for most subjects (84% AMP5A, 71% control). The study met its primary endpoint with no AMP5A treatment-related adverse events (AEs), and the incidence and severity of AEs were comparable between groups: 18 AEs for control (8 mild, 1 moderate, 9 severe) and 19 AEs for AMP5A (7 mild, 7 moderate, 5 severe). Notably, subjects treated with AMP5A had fewer deaths (5% vs. 24%), shorter hospital stay (8\u00c2\u00a0days vs. 12\u00c2\u00a0days), fewer ICU admissions (21% vs. 33%), and a greater proportion with improved clinical outcomes than control. Conclusion: The phase I clinical results indicate inhaled AMP5A is safe, is well tolerated, and could lead to fewer patients experiencing deterioration or death.

Introduction: We aimed to evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and immunogenicity of a single dose of LY-CovMab in Chinese healthy adults. Methods: We conducted a phase\u00c2\u00a01, randomized, dose-escalation, placebo-controlled trial in 42 volunteers, 18\u00e2\u20ac\u201c45\u00c2\u00a0years of age, and 40 out of 42 received a single dose of LY-CovMab or placebo with LY-CovMab at a dose of 30\u00c2\u00a0mg, 150\u00c2\u00a0mg, 600\u00c2\u00a0mg, 1200\u00c2\u00a0mg, and 2400\u00c2\u00a0mg. There were ten subjects in each group receiving LY-CovMab or placebo in a 4:1 ratio with the exception that the 30\u00c2\u00a0mg group had two subjects both receiving LY-CovMab. Results: Among the 42 randomized participants, 40 received an injection with 32 administered LY-CovMab and 8 administered placebo. A total of 18 drug-related treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) were reported in 12 subjects (30.0%), including protein urine present (25%, 10/40) and blood creatinine increased (7.5%, 3/40). The incidence of drug-related TEAE in each dosage group was as follows: 150\u00c2\u00a0mg (28.6%, 2/7), 600\u00c2\u00a0mg (25%, 2/8), 1200\u00c2\u00a0mg (14.3%, 1/7), 2400\u00c2\u00a0mg (50%, 4/8), and placebo (37.5%, 3/8). All drug-related TEAEs were grade\u00c2\u00a01, and most of them were recovering/resolving or recovered/resolved without taking action. The serum exposure of LY-CovMab (Cmax, AUC0\u00e2\u20ac\u201clast, AUC0\u00e2\u20ac\u201cinf) after intravenous infusion increased in an approximately proportional manner as the dose increased from 150 to 2400\u00c2\u00a0mg. The elimination half-life (t1/2) value did not differ among different dose cohorts and was estimated to be around 28.5\u00c2\u00a0days. Conclusions: A single dose of LY-CovMab was shown to be safe and well tolerated in Chinese healthy adults.

Purpose: Intra-operative management of the surgical margin in patients diagnosed with head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) remains challenging as surgeons still have to rely on visual and tactile information. Fluorescence-guided surgery using tumor-specific imaging agents can assist in clinical decision-making. However, a standardized imaging methodology is lacking. In this study, we determined whether a standardized, specimen-driven, fluorescence imaging framework using ONM-100 could assist in clinical decision-making during surgery. Procedures: Thirteen patients with histologically proven HNSCC were included in this clinical study and received ONM-100 24 \u00c2\u00b1 8 h before surgery. Fluorescence images of the excised surgical specimen and of the surgical cavity were analyzed. A fluorescent lesion with a tumor-to-background ratio (TBR) > 1.5 was considered fluorescence-positive and correlated to standard of care (SOC) histopathology. Results: All six tumor-positive surgical margins were detected immediately after excision using fluorescence-guided intra-operative imaging. Postoperative analysis showed a median TBR (\u00c2\u00b1IQR) of the fluorescent lesions on the resection margin of 3.36 \u00c2\u00b1 1.62. Three fluorescence-positive lesions in the surgical cavity were biopsied and showed occult carcinoma and severe dysplasia, and a false-positive fluorescence lesion. Conclusion: Our specimen-driven fluorescence framework using a novel, pH-activatable, fluorescent imaging agent could assist in reliable and real-time adequate clinical decision-making showing that a fluorescent lesion on the surgical specimen with a TBR of 1.5 is correlated to a tumor-positive resection margin. The binary mechanism of ONM-100 allows for a sharp tumor delineation in all patients, giving the surgeon a clinical tool for real-time margin assessment, with a high sensitivity.",

The transvenous endovascular approach, which has become an optimal method for the treatment of cerebrovascular diseases, such as malformation, fistula, and chronic intracranial hypertension, due to sinus thromboses, frequently uses retrograde navigation through dural sinuses. Whether or how much the endoscopic procedure damages the chordae willisii is often not well-assessed. In our study, an overall number of 38 cadaveric heads were analyzed for the distribution and features of the chordae willisii in the straight sinus. We used an endoscope on these samples mimicking a mechanical thrombectomy procedure performed in the straight sinus. Both endoscopic gross observation and light microscopic histological examination were used to assess the damages to the chordae willisii by the procedure. We found that the valve-like lamellae and longitudinal lamellae structures were mainly found in the posterior part of straight sinus whereas trabeculae were present in both anterior and posterior portions. We treated a group of samples with a stent and another with a balloon. The stent-treated group had a significantly higher rate of Grade 1 damage comparing with the balloon-treated group (p = 0.02). The incidence of damage to the surface of chordae willisii was also higher in the stent-treated group (p = 0.00). Neither the use of stent nor of balloon increased the rate of damage to chordae willisii during repeated experiments. These findings indicated that stent or balloon navigation through the straight sinus can cause minor damages to the chordae willisii and frequent uses of retrograde navigation through the straight sinus do not appear to increase the rates of damage to chordae willisii.",

Purpose: Epilepsy is one of the most disabling neurological disorders, which affects all age groups and often results in severe consequences. Since misdiagnoses are common, many pediatric patients fail to receive the correct treatment. Recently, 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (18F-FDG PET) imaging has been used for the evaluation of pediatric epilepsy. However, the epileptic focus is very difficult to be identified by visual assessment since it may present either hypo- or hyper-metabolic abnormality with unclear boundary. This study aimed to develop a novel symmetricity-driven deep learning framework of PET imaging for the identification of epileptic foci in pediatric patients with temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE). Methods: We retrospectively included 201 pediatric patients with TLE and 24 age-matched controls who underwent 18F-FDG PET-CT studies. 18F-FDG PET images were quantitatively investigated using 386 symmetricity features, and a pair-of-cube (PoC)-based Siamese convolutional neural network (CNN) was proposed for precise localization of epileptic focus, and then metabolic abnormality level of the predicted focus was calculated automatically by asymmetric index (AI). Performances of the proposed framework were compared with visual assessment, statistical parametric mapping (SPM) software, and Jensen-Shannon divergence-based logistic regression (JS-LR) analysis. Results: The proposed deep learning framework could detect the epileptic foci accurately with the dice coefficient of 0.51, which was significantly higher than that of SPM (0.24, P < 0.01) and significantly (or marginally) higher than that of visual assessment (0.31\u00e2\u20ac\u201c0.44, P = 0.005\u00e2\u20ac\u201c0.27). The area under the curve (AUC) of the PoC classification was higher than that of the JS-LR (0.93 vs. 0.72). The metabolic level detection accuracy of the proposed method was significantly higher than that of visual assessment blinded or unblinded to clinical information (90% vs. 56% or 68%, P < 0.01). Conclusion: The proposed deep learning framework for 18F-FDG PET imaging could identify epileptic foci accurately and efficiently, which might be applied as a computer-assisted approach for the future diagnosis of epilepsy patients.

We used liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry to quantify clinically important oxidative stress biomarkers and APAP metabolites in plasma samples from 45 patients who participated in a randomized controlled trial (SNAP trial). We investigated the time course response of plasma metabolites at predose, 12\u00c2\u00a0h, and 20.25\u00c2\u00a0h post-start of NAC infusion. The results showed that the 12\u00c2\u00a0h modified regimen resulted in a significant elevation of plasma NAC and cysteine concentrations at 12\u00c2\u00a0h post-infusion. We found no significant alteration in the metabolism of APAP, mitochondrial, amino acids, and other thiol biomarkers with the two regimens. We examined APAP and purine metabolism in overdose patients who developed ALI. We showed the major APAP-metabolites and xanthine were significantly higher in patients with ALI. These biomarkers correlated well with alanine aminotransferase activity at admission. Receiver operating characteristic analysis showed that at admission, plasma APAP-metabolites and xanthine concentrations were predictive for ALI. In conclusion, a significantly higher redox thiol response with the modified NAC regimen at 12\u00c2\u00a0h postdose suggests this regimen may produce greater antioxidant efficacy. At baseline, plasma APAP and purine metabolites may be useful biomarkers for early prediction of APAP-induced ALI.",

Purpose: Since the discovery of the well-known cis-platin, transition metal complexes are highly recognized as cytostatic agents. However, toxic side effects of the metal ions present in the complexes may pose significant problems for their future development. Therefore, we investigated the metal-free salalen ligand WQF 044. Methods: DNA fragmentations in leukemia (Nalm6) and solid tumor cells (BJAB, MelHO, MCF-7, RM82) proved the apoptotic effects of WQF 044, its overcoming of resistances and the cellular pathways that are affected by the substance. The apoptotic mechanisms finding were supported by western blot analysis, measurement of the mitochondrial membrane potential and polymerase chain reactions. Results: A complex intervention in the mitochondrial pathway of apoptosis with a Bcl-2 and caspase dependence was observed. Additionally, a wide range of tumors were affected by the ligand in a low micromolar range in-vitro. The compound overcame multidrug resistances in P-gp over-expressed acute lymphoblastic leukemia and CD95-downregulated Ewing\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s sarcoma cells. Quite remarkable synergistic effects with vincristine were observed in Burkitt-like lymphoma cells.

The current pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has led to dramatic economic and health burdens. Although the worldwide SARS-CoV-2 vaccination campaign has begun, exploration of other vaccine candidates is needed due to uncertainties with the current approved vaccines, such as durability of protection, cross-protection against variant strains, and costs of long-term production and storage. In this study, we developed a methyltransferase-defective recombinant vesicular stomatitis virus (mtdVSV)based SARS-CoV-2 vaccine candidate. We generated mtdVSVs expressing SARS-CoV-2 full-length spike (S) protein, S1, or its receptor-binding domain (RBD). All of these recombinant viruses grew to high titers in mammalian cells despite high attenuation in cell culture. The SARS-CoV-2 S protein and its truncations were highly expressed by the mtdVSV vector. These mtdVSV-based vaccine candidates were completely attenuated in both immunocompetent and immunocompromised mice. Among these constructs, mtdVSV-S induced high levels of SARS-CoV-2-specific neutralizing antibodies (NAbs) and Th1-biased T-cell immune responses in mice. In Syrian golden hamsters, the serum levels of SARS-CoV-2-specific NAbs triggered by mtdVSV-S were higher than the levels of NAbs in convalescent plasma from recovered COVID-19 patients. In addition, hamsters immunized with mtdVSV-S were completely protected against SARS-CoV-2 replication in lung and nasal turbinate tissues, cytokine storm, and lung pathology. Collectively, our data demonstrate that mtdVSV expressing SARS-CoV-2 S protein is a safe and highly efficacious vaccine candidate against SARS-CoV-2 infection. IMPORTANCE Viral mRNA cap methyltransferase (MTase) is essential for mRNA stability, protein translation, and innate immune evasion. Thus, viral mRNA cap MTase activity is an excellent target for development of live attenuated or live vectored vaccine candidates. Here, we developed a panel of MTase-defective recombinant vesicular stomatitis virus (mtdVSV)-based SARS-CoV-2 vaccine candidates expressing full-length S, S1, or several versions of the RBD. These mtdVSV-based vaccine candidates grew to high titers in cell culture and were completely attenuated in both immunocompetent and immunocompromised mice. Among these vaccine candidates, mtdVSV-S induces high levels of SARS-CoV-2-specific neutralizing antibodies (Nabs) and Th1-biased immune responses in mice. Syrian golden hamsters immunized with mtdVSV-S triggered SARS-CoV-2-specific NAbs at higher levels than those in convalescent plasma from recovered COVID-19 patients. Furthermore, hamsters immunized with mtdVSV-S were completely protected against SARS-CoV-2 challenge. Thus, mtdVSV is a safe and highly effective vector to deliver SARS-CoV-2 vaccine.",

Anthrax, by Bacillus anthracis, remains a dreadful fatal hazard worldwide. The currently used anthrax vaccines are plagued by numerous issues that limit their widespread use. As an immunization approach targeting both extracellular antigens and toxins of B. anthracis may achieve better sterile immunity, the present investigation designed a bicistronic secretory anti-anthrax DNA vaccine targeting immune response against toxin and cells. The efficacy of the vaccine was compared with monocistronic DNA vaccines and the currently used anthrax vaccine. For this, mice were immunized with the developed vaccine containing pag (encoding protective antigen to block toxin) and eag genes (encoding EA1 to target cells) of B. anthracis through DNA-prime/Protein-boost (D/P) and DNA prime/DNA-boost (D/D) approaches. There was a >2 and > 5 fold increase in specific antibody level by D/D and D/P approaches respectively, on 42nd days post-immunization (dpi). Serum cytokine profiling showed that both Th1 and Th2 immune responses were elicited, with more Th2 responses in D/P strategy. More importantly, challenge with 100 times LD50 of B. anthracis at 42nd dpi exhibited maximum cumulative survival (83.33 %) by bicistronic D/P approach. Remarkably, immunization with EA1 delayed mortality onset in infection. The study forms the first report on complement-dependent bactericidal activity of antiEA1 antibodies. In short, co-immunization of PA and EA1 through the developed bicistronic DNA vaccine would be an effective immunization approach in anthrax vaccination. Further, D/P strategy could enhance vaccine-induced immunity against B. anthracis. Altogether, the study generates certain critical insights having direct applications in next-generation vaccine development against anthrax.",

Background: Recurrence of nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) after chemoradiotherapy is common, but submucosal recurrence of NPC is rare. The final pathological results determine the optimal therapeutic schedule for treatment of NPC recurrence, but tissue retrieval from submucosal lesions is usually difficult. The present study aimed to assess the safety and efficacy of a novel approach of endonasopharyngeal ultrasound-guided transnasopharyngeal needle aspiration (ENUS-TNNA) for submucosal neoplasms in patients with suspected NPC recurrence. Methods: Between March 2017 and June 2021, 11 post-chemoradiotherapy patients with suspected magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings of submucosal recurrence of NPC underwent ENUS-TNNA. The safety and effectiveness of using ENUS-TNNA to sample submucosal neoplasms were evaluated. Results: Needle aspiration biopsies were performed without any incidences in all cases. Out of the 11 patients, nine were diagnosed with submucosal recurrence of NPC via histopathological or cytological evaluations. Of the two puncture-negative cases, one patient had atypical imaging findings and clinical manifestations and was therefore followed-up using MRI. After follow-up for 3 years, this patient was still considered to be cancer-free due to the shrinking diameters of the submucosal lesions. For the other puncture-negative patient, submucosal biopsy samples were obtained using a surgical method. Pathological examination of these biopsies revealed that an angiosarcoma had developed after radiotherapy. There were no severe complications that occurred during the ENUS-TNNA procedure.

Purpose: To compare the pharmacokinetic profiles, safety and immunogenicity of proposed bevacizumab biosimilar HLX04 with reference bevacizumab in healthy Chinese males. Methods: In this double-blind Phase 1 study, healthy volunteers (N = 208) were randomized 1:1:1:1 to a single 3\u00c2\u00a0mg/kg intravenous infusion of HLX04 or reference bevacizumab sourced from the United States (bevacizumab-US), the European Union (bevacizumab-EU) or China (bevacizumab-CN). Co-primary endpoints were area under the serum concentration\u00e2\u20ac\u201ctime profile (AUC) from time zero extrapolated to infinity (AUC0\u00e2\u20ac\u201cinf) and from zero to last quantifiable concentration (AUClast). Secondary endpoint was the maximum serum drug concentration (Cmax).

Results: Pharmacokinetic parameters were similar across groups. The respective geometric least-squares mean ratios (GLSMR) of AUC0\u00e2\u20ac\u201cinf, AUClast and Cmax were: 95.7%, 96.0% and 101.8% for HLX04 versus bevacizumab-US; 94.3%, 94.6% and 100.5% for HLX04 versus bevacizumab-EU; and 90.0%, 90.4% and 98.2% for HLX04 versus bevacizumab-CN.

Background: Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a heterogenous malignancy driven by genetic and epigenetic factors. Inhibition of bromodomain and extraterminal (BET) proteins, epigenetic readers that play pivotal roles in the regulation of genes relevant to cancer pathogenesis, constitutes a novel AML treatment approach. Methods: In this first-in-human study of the pan-BET inhibitor mivebresib as monotherapy (MIV-mono) or in combination with venetoclax (MIV-Ven), the safety profile, efficacy, and pharmacodynamics of mivebresib were determined in patients with relapsed/refractory AML (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier NCT02391480). Mivebresib was administered at 3 monotherapy dose levels (1.5, 2.0, or 2.5 mg) or in combination with venetoclax (400 or 800 mg). Results: Forty-four patients started treatment: of 19 who started MIV-mono, 5 went on to receive MIV-Ven combination therapy after disease progression and a washout period. Twenty-five patients started MIV-Ven, resulting in a total of 30 patients treated with the combination. The most common mivebresib-related treatment-emergent adverse events were dysgeusia (74%), decreased appetite (42%), and diarrhea (42%) in the MIV-mono group and decreased appetite (44%), vomiting (44%), and nausea (40%) in the MIV-Ven group. Serious adverse events occurred in 14 patients (74%) who received MIV-mono and in 22 patients (88%) who received MIV-Ven. In the MIV-mono group, responses were complete remission with incomplete blood count recovery in 1 patient and resistant disease in 15 patients. In the MIV-Ven group, responses were complete remission in 2 patients, partial remission in 2 patients, morphologic leukemia-free state in 2 patients, resistant disease in 12 patients, and aplasia in 1 patient. The pharmacodynamic effects of mivebresib were proportional to dose and drug exposure. Conclusions: Mivebresib was tolerated and showed antileukemic effects as monotherapy and in combination with venetoclax in patients with relapsed/refractory AML. Lay Summary: Mivebresib is a novel drug that influences the way cancer cells read genetic information. Mivebresib was tested together with venetoclax in patients with acute myeloid leukemia after standard medicines failed and the disease returned, or when standard medicine was unavailable.

A Markov model described transition states for 35,356 MOAA/S-time observations from 1071 subjects. Effect-compartment models of remimazolam and fentanyl linked plasma concentrations to the Markov model, and drug effects were described using a synergistic maximum effect (Emax) model.

Introduction: Favipiravir is an antiviral agent that is recently used for SARS-CoV2 infection. The drug-drug interactions of favipiravir especially with chemotherapeutic agents in a patient with malignancy are not well known. Case report: The patient diagnosed with metastatic osteosarcoma was given high dose methotrexate treatment, and favipiravir was started on the third day of the treatment with suspicion of SARS-CoV2 infection. Grade 3 hepatotoxicity developed after favipiravir. Management & outcome: The acute viral hepatitis panel and autoimmune liver disease panel were negative. The ultrasound of the abdomen was unremarkable for any hepatobiliary pathology. The all viral and hepatobiliary possible etiological factors were ruled out. The patient\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s liver enzymes increased just after (12 hours later) the initiation of favipiravir, and we diagnosed toxic hepatitis caused by favipiravir-methotrexate interaction. Therefore, methylprednisolone 1 mg/kg dose was started for a presumed diagnosis of toxic hepatitis. Hepatotoxicity completely regressed after favipiravir was discontinued. Discussion: Favipiravir may inhibit methotrexate elimination by inhibiting aldehyde oxidase and its sequential use may cause hepatotoxicity in this case.

Many studies seek to evaluate the effects of potentially harmful pregnancy exposures during specific gestational periods. We consider an observational pregnancy cohort where pregnant individuals can initiate medication usage or become exposed to a drug at various times during their pregnancy. An important statistical challenge involves how to define and estimate exposure effects when pregnancy loss or delivery can occur over time. Without proper consideration, the results of standard analysis may be vulnerable to selection bias, immortal time-bias, and time-dependent confounding. In this study, we apply the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153target trials\u00e2\u20ac\u009d framework of Hern\u00c3\u00a1n and Robins in order to define effects based on the counterfactual approach often used in causal inference. This effect is defined relative to a hypothetical randomized trial of timed pregnancy exposures where delivery may precede and thus potentially interrupt exposure initiation. We describe specific implementations of inverse probability weighting, G-computation, and Targeted Maximum Likelihood Estimation to estimate the effects of interest. We demonstrate the performance of all estimators using simulated data and show that a standard implementation of inverse probability weighting is biased.

Background: Retrospective analyses of randomized trials suggest that Black men with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) have longer survival than White men. The authors conducted a prospective study of abiraterone acetate plus prednisone to explore outcomes by race. Methods: This race-stratified, multicenter study estimated radiographic progression-free survival (rPFS) in Black and White men with mCRPC. Secondary end points included prostate-specific antigen (PSA) kinetics, overall survival (OS), and safety. Exploratory analysis included genome-wide genotyping to identify single nucleotide polymorphisms associated with progression in a model incorporating genetic ancestry. One hundred patients self-identified as White (n = 50) or Black (n = 50) were enrolled. Eligibility criteria were modified to facilitate the enrollment of individual Black patients. Results: The median rPFS for Black and White patients was 16.6 and 16.8 months, respectively; their times to PSA progression (TTP) were 16.6 and 11.5 months, respectively; and their OS was 35.9 and 35.7 months, respectively. Estimated rates of PSA decline by \u00e2\u2030\u00a550% in Black and White patients were 74% and 66%, respectively; and PSA declines to <0.2 ng/mL were 26% and 10%, respectively.

Conclusions: Multicenter prospective studies by race are feasible in men with mCRPC but require less restrictive eligibility. Despite higher comorbidity rates, Black patients demonstrated rPFS and OS similar to those of White patients and trended toward greater TTP and PSA declines, consistent with retrospective reports.

Background: Intensive care unit acquired weakness is a serious problem, contributing to respiratory failure and reductions in ambulation. Currently, there is no pharmacological therapy for this condition. Studies indicate, however, that both beta-hydroxy-beta-methylbutyrate (HMB) and eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) increase muscle function in patients with cancer and in older adults. The purpose of this study was to determine whether HMB and/or EPA administration would increase diaphragm and quadriceps strength in mechanically ventilated patients. Methods: Studies were performed on 83 mechanically ventilated patients who were recruited from the Medical Intensive Care Units at the University of Kentucky. Diaphragm strength was assessed as the trans-diaphragmatic pressure generated by supramaximal magnetic phrenic nerve stimulation (PdiTw). Quadriceps strength was assessed as leg force generated by supramaximal magnetic femoral nerve stimulation (QuadTw). Diaphragm and quadriceps thickness were assessed by ultrasound. Baseline measurements of muscle strength and size were performed, and patients were then randomized to one of four treatment groups (placebo, HMB 3 gm/day, EPA 2 gm/day and HMB plus EPA). Strength and size measurements were repeated 11\u00c2\u00a0days after study entry. ANCOVA statistical testing was used to compare variables across the four experimental groups. Results: Treatments failed to increase the strength and thickness of either the diaphragm or quadriceps when compared to placebo. In addition, treatments also failed to decrease the duration of mechanical ventilation after study entry. Conclusions: These results indicate that a 10-day course of HMB and/or EPA does not improve skeletal muscle strength in critically ill mechanically ventilated patients.

Although panitumumab is well tolerated in most patients, pulmonary toxicity, especially interstitial lung disease (ILD), is a life-threatening condition. The presentation of panitumumab-induced ILD with spontaneous pneumomediastinum and subcutaneous emphysema is rarely reported. Case report: We describe a 61-year-old male with metastatic colorectal carcinoma treated with FOLFIRI (folinic acid, 5-fluorouracil, irinotecan) and panitumumab. He presented to our hospital with a complaint of severe dyspnea. On the evaluation of dyspnea, the patient was diagnosed with ILD. Management and outcome: After exclusion of other common causes of pneumomediastinum and subcutaneous emphysema, panitumumab was attributed as a cause of ILD. Oxygen therapy via high flow nasal cannula and intravenous methylprednisolone regimen was started. After two weeks, the patient became asymptomatic with the radiologic amelioration. Discussion: Panitumumab-induced ILD is associated with a poor prognosis and might occur randomly in one year after the drug administration. The possibility of the disease should be considered on every admission. Early recognition, discontinuation of causative medication, and immediate glucocorticoid therapy are essential to reduce mortality.",

Objective: This study evaluated clinical outcomes in children and adolescents with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) treated with the \u00ce\u00b12-adrenoceptor agonist guanfacine extended-release (GXR) in routine Canadian clinical practice. Methods: This retrospective chart review focused on patients with ADHD aged 6\u00e2\u20ac\u201c17\u00c2\u00a0years initiating treatment with GXR as monotherapy or adjunctive therapy. Patients were followed for up to 12\u00c2\u00a0months after GXR initiation and, if they had received prior ADHD pharmacotherapy, for 12\u00c2\u00a0months before GXR initiation. The primary outcome was change in ADHD symptoms and functionality based on physician assessments, classified as improvement, no change, or worsening relative to the time of GXR initiation. Treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) were evaluated. Clinical outcomes were also analyzed post hoc according to whether GXR treatment was received as monotherapy or adjunctive therapy, and by select psychiatric comorbidities. Exploratory analyses were conducted in patients who had received prior ADHD pharmacotherapy to evaluate clinical outcomes after initiating GXR. Results: Improvements in ADHD symptoms were reported for 232/330 (70.3%) patients. Functional improvements in school performance and home life were reported for 213/330 (64.5%) and 209/330 (63.3%) patients, respectively. The most frequent TEAEs (\u00e2\u2030\u00a5 5%) were somnolence, headache, insomnia, presyncope, and decreased appetite. Improvements in ADHD symptoms were observed when GXR was received as either monotherapy (35/60 [58.3%]) or adjunctive therapy (197/270 [73.0%]). Improvements in ADHD symptoms and functionality were observed in the majority of patients with select psychiatric comorbidities. Among patients who had experienced worsening of symptoms with prior ADHD pharmacotherapy, 44/54 (81.5%) experienced symptom improvement, 33/44 (75.0%) who had previously experienced worsening of school performance improved, and 34/48 (70.8%) who had previously experienced worsening of home life improved.

Home-based measures of lung function, inflammation, symptoms, and medication use are frequently collected in respiratory clinical trials. However, new statistical approaches are needed to make better use of the information contained in these data-rich variables. In this work, we use data from two phase III asthma clinical trials demonstrating the benefit of benralizumab treatment to develop a novel longitudinal mixed effects model of peak expiratory flow (PEF), a lung function measure easily captured at home using a hand-held device. The model is based on an extension of the mixed effects modeling framework to incorporate stochastic differential equations and allows for quantification of several statistical properties of a patient's PEF data: the longitudinal trend, long-term fluctuations, and day-to-day variability. These properties are compared between treatment groups and related to a patient's exacerbation risk using a repeated time-to-event model. The mixed effects model adequately described the observed data from the two clinical trials, and model parameters were accurately estimated. Benralizumab treatment was shown to improve a patient's average PEF level and reduce long-term fluctuations. Both of these effects were shown to be associated with a lower exacerbation risk. The day-to-day variability was neither significantly affected by treatment nor associated with exacerbation risk. Our work shows the potential of a stochastic model-based analysis of home-based lung function measures to support better estimation and understanding of treatment effects and disease stability. The proposed analysis can serve as a complement to descriptive statistics of home-based measures in the reporting of respiratory clinical trials.",

Introduction: Hodgkin lymphoma is a highly curable lymphoproliferative malignancy with an overall relative survival rate of 87.4%. It is characterized by multinucleated Reed\u00e2\u20ac\u201cSternberg cells which are mostly derived from B cells in the germinal center. Case report: We present a case of a 40-year-old gentleman with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome who presented with Stage 4b Hodgkin lymphoma complicated with fulminant hepatic failure and direct hyperbilirubinemia. The initial presentation of Hodgkin lymphoma as cholestatic jaundice is extremely rare. Management and outcome: Though the survival rate with chemotherapy is high, the fulminant hepatic failure made the situation challenging with the use of chemotherapeutic regimens that require hepatic excretion. He received dose reduced adriamycin-bleomycin-vinblastine-dacarbazine regimen [doxorubicin 12.5\u00e2\u20ac\u2026mg (6.75\u00e2\u20ac\u2026mg/m2), bleomycin 18\u00e2\u20ac\u2026units (10\u00e2\u20ac\u2026units/m2), vinblastine 3\u00e2\u20ac\u2026mg (1.5\u00e2\u20ac\u2026mg/m2), dacarbazine 380\u00e2\u20ac\u2026mg (190\u00e2\u20ac\u2026mg/m2)] as well as bictegravir/emtricitabine/tenofovir alafenamide since admission for treatment of human immunodeficiency virus and hepatitis B.

Purpose: Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is an aggressive, lethal, heterogeneous type of breast cancer (BC). TNBC tends to have a lower response rate to chemotherapy and a lower 5-year survival rate than other types of BC due to recurrence and metastasis. Our previous study revealed that a combination of gemcitabine, romidepsin, and cisplatin was efficacious in controlling TNBC tumor development. In this study, we extended our investigation of gemcitabine + romidepsin + cisplatin in controlling TNBC tumor recurrence and metastasis. Methods: We investigated the ability of gemcitabine + romidepsin + cisplatin to control cell survival and invasiveness using cell viability, soft agar colony formation, and transwell invasion assays. We determined the efficacy of gemcitabine + romidepsin + cisplatin in controlling tumor recurrence and metastasis using cell-derived xenograft animal models. We used immunoblotting to study signaling modulators regulated by gemcitabine + romidepsin + cisplatin in TNBC cells and tumor tissues. Results: Treatment with gemcitabine + romidepsin + cisplatin reduced the TNBC MDA-MB231 and MDA-MB468 cell survival to ~ 50% and ~ 15%, as well as invasiveness to ~ 31% and ~ 13%, respectively. Gemcitabine + romidepsin + cisplatin suppressed modulators involved in epithelial-mesenchymal transition in an ROS-dependent manner. Controlling tumor recurrence, the Gem plus Rom + Cis regimen (~ 112%) was more efficacious than the Gem plus Cis regimen (~ 21%) in tumor growth inhibition. The Gem plus Rom + Cis regimen efficaciously reduced the development of metastatic nodules to 20% in animals. Conclusion: The gemcitabine plus romidepsin + cisplatin regimen was highly efficacious in controlling TNBC tumor development, recurrence, and metastasis in animals.

In this study, we further showed that the ALCAM-EGF/EGFR axis regulated the MM side population (SP)-mediated drug-resistance. ALCAM-knockdown MM cells displayed an enhanced ratio of SP cells in the presence of bone marrow stromal cells (BMSCs) or with the supplement of recombinant EGF. SP MM cells were resistant to chemotherapeutics melphalan or bortezomib. Drug treatment stimulated SP-genesis. Mechanistically, EGFR, primed with EGF, activated the hedgehog pathway and promoted the SP ratio; meanwhile, ALCAM inhibited EGFR downstream pro-MM cell signaling. Further, SP MM cells exhibited an increased number of mitochondria compared to the main population. Interference of the mitochondria function strongly inhibited SP-genesis. Animal studies showed that combination therapy with both an anti-MM agent and EGFR inhibitor gefitinib achieved prolonged MM-bearing mice survival.

Temozolomide + irinotecan is commonly used as salvage therapy for neuroblastoma. Patient-derived cell lines and xenografts established from patients with relapsed ALT neuroblastoma demonstrated de novo resistance to temozolomide + irinotecan [SN-38 in vitro, P < 0.05; in vivo mouse event-free survival (EFS), P < 0.0001] vs. telomerase-positive neuroblastomas. We observed that ALT neuroblastoma cells manifested constitutive ataxia-telangiectasia mutated (ATM) activation due to spontaneous telomere dysfunction which was not observed in telomerase-positive neuroblastoma cells. We demonstrated that induction of telomere dysfunction resulted in ATM activation that, in turn, conferred resistance to temozolomide + SN-38 (4.2-fold change in IC50, P < 0.001). ATM knockdown (shRNA) or inhibition using a clinical-stage small-molecule inhibitor (AZD0156) reversed resistance to temozolomide + irinotecan in ALT neuroblastoma cell lines in vitro (P < 0.001) and in four ALT xenografts in vivo (EFS, P < 0.0001).

Mice were injected subcutaneously into both flanks with 4T1 cells, and treatment was initiated 12 days later. Mice were randomly assigned to three treatment groups: (1) control (no treatment with RT or immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI)), (2) RT alone, and (3) RT+ICI. The same RT dose was prescribed in both RT-alone and RT+ICI groups as 10Gy/fx in two fractions and delivered to only one of the two tumor burdens injected at both sides of flanks. In the RT+ICI group, 200 \u00c2\u00b5g fixed dose of PD-1 antibody was intra-peritoneally administered concurrently with RT. The RT and ICI combination markedly reduced tumor cell growth not only in the irradiated site but also in non-irradiated sites, a typical characteristic of the abscopal effect. This was observed only in radiation-sensitive cancer cells. Lung metastasis development was lower in RT-irradiated groups (RT-only and RT+ICI groups) than in the non-irradiated group, regardless of the radiation sensitivity of tumor cells. However, there was no additive effect of ICI on RT to control lung metastasis, as was already known regarding the abscopal effect. The combination of local RT with anti-PD-1 blockade could be a promising treatment strategy against metastatic TNBC. Further research is required to integrate our results into a clinical setting.",

It was reported that MGMTlow gliomas may still be resistant to TMZ, while the mechanisms remain poorly understood. In this study, we demonstrated that rho-associated kinase 2 (ROCK2), a cytoskeleton regulator, was highly expressed in MGMTlow recurrent gliomas, and its expression strongly correlated with poor overall survival (OS) time in a subset of MGMTlow recurrent gliomas patients with TMZ therapy. And we also found that overactive ROCK2 enhanced homologous recombination repair (HR) in TMZ-resistant (TMZ-R) glioma cell lines with low MGMT expression. Silencing ROCK2 impaired HR repair, and induced double-strand break (DSB) and eradicated TMZ-R glioma cells in culture. Notably, in MGMTlow TMZ-R models, as a key factor of HR, ataxia telangiectasia-mutated (ATM) expression was upregulated directly by hyper-activation of ROCK2 to improve HR efficiency. ROCK2 enhanced the binding of transcription factor zinc finger E-box binding homeobox 1 (ZEB1) to ATM promoter for increasing ATM expression. Moreover, ROCK2 transformed ZEB1 into a gene activator via Yes-associated protein 1 (YAP1). These results provide evidence for the use of ROCK inhibitors in the clinical therapy for MGMTlow TMZ-resistant glioma.

BACKGROUND: Patients with hypertension and diabetes mellitus are susceptible to dementia, but regular therapy fails to reduce the risk of dementia. Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists have neuroprotective effects in experimental studies. We aimed to assess the effect of liraglutide, a glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist, on cognitive function and whether its effect was associated with metabolic changes in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. METHODS AND RESULTS: Fifty patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus were recruited in this prospective study. All patients under-went cognitive assessment and brain activation monitoring by functional near-infrared spectroscopy. At 12 weeks, patients in the glucagon-like peptide-1 group acquired better scores in all cognitive tests and showed remarkable improvement in memory and attention (P=0.040) test compared with the control group after multivariable adjustment. Compared with the control group, liraglutide significantly increased activation of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and orbitofrontal cortex brain regions (P=0.0038). After liraglutide treatment, cognitive scores were significantly correlated with changes in these activating brain regions (P<0.05), but no correlation was observed between the changes in cognitive function and changes of body mass index, blood pressure, and glycemic levels. CONCLUSIONS: We concluded that liraglutide improves cognitive decline in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. This benefi-cial effect is independent of its hypoglycemic effect and weight loss. The optimal intervention should be targeted to cognitive decline in the early stages of dementia.",

Objective: Hyperglycemia is associated with albuminuria and renal glomerular endothelial dysfunction in patients with diabetic nephropathy. The mTOR and RhoA/ROCK signaling pathways are involved in glomerular filtration barrier (GFB) regulation, but their role in high glucose (HG)-induced GFB dysfunction in human renal glomerular endothelial cells (HRGECs) has not been investigated. This study aimed to investigate the mechanisms of HG-induced GFB dysfunction in vitro. Materials and methods: HRGECs were cultured in vitro and exposed to HG. The horseradish peroxidase\u00e2\u20ac\u201calbumin leakage and transendothelial electrical resistance of the endothelial monolayer were measured after HG treatment with or without rapamycin preincubation. A fluorescence probe was used to study the distribution of F-actin reorganization. The phosphorylation levels of myosin light chain (MLC) and mTOR were measured via western blotting. RhoA activity was evaluated via GTPase activation assay. The effects of blocking mTOR or the RhoA/ROCK pathway on endothelial permeability and MLC phosphorylation under HG conditions were observed. Results: HG exposure induced F-actin reorganization and increased MLC phosphorylation, leading to EC barrier disruption. This effect was attenuated by treatment with rapamycin or Y-27632. Phospho-MLC (pMLC) activation in HRGECs was mediated by RhoA/ROCK signaling. mTOR and RhoA/ROCK inhibition or knockdown attenuated pMLC activation, F-actin reorganization and barrier disruption that occurred in response to HG exposure.

Methods: This retrospective claims analysis of MS patients initiating a new DMT was conducted using the IBM MarketScan Commercial and Medicare Supplemental databases between April 2016 and December 2019. Continuous enrollment of \u00e2\u2030\u00a5 12\u00c2\u00a0months before and up to 24\u00c2\u00a0months after initiating the index DMT was required.

Persistence was defined as no evidence of switching to another DMT or no gap \u00e2\u2030\u00a5 60\u00c2\u00a0days in DMT coverage. Results: A total of 1710 patients with \u00e2\u2030\u00a5 24\u00c2\u00a0months of follow-up (OCR, n = 524; oral, n = 701; injectable, n = 365; other intravenous [IV], n = 120) were included. Patients initiating OCR had higher adherence (80% vs. 55%, 35%, and 54% for oral, injectable, and other IV, respectively) and persistence (75% vs. 54%, 33%, and 55%, respectively) at 24\u00c2\u00a0months.

Introduction: The most common symptom in heart failure (HF) is congestion, which can be refractory to diuretic treatment. Aim: To verify whether, in patients with advanced HF and diuretic resistance, subcutaneous furosemide or furosemide in an oral solution can improve the clinical-analytical status. Methods: From 2018 to 2020, 27 consecutive outpatients with diuretic resistance, not candidates for other alternatives, were recruited. Patients were treated either with subcutaneous furosemide in elastomeric pump (n: 10) or with oral solution (n: 17) for 5 days.

Background: The effects of adrenaline on cerebral blood vessels during cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) are not well understood. We developed an extracorporeal CPR model that maintains constant low systemic blood flow while allowing adrenaline-associated effects on cerebral vasculature to be assessed at different mean arterial pressure (MAP) levels independently of the effects on systemic blood flow. Methods: After eight minutes of cardiac arrest, low-flow extracorporeal life support (ECLS) (30 ml/kg/min) was started in fourteen pigs. After ten minutes, continuous adrenaline administration was started to achieve MAP values of 40 (n = 7) or 60 mmHg (n = 7). Measurements included intracranial pressure (ICP), cerebral perfusion pressure (CePP), laser-Doppler-derived regional cerebral blood flow (CBF), cerebral regional oxygen saturation (rSO2), brain tissue oxygen tension (PbtO2) and extracellular cerebral metabolites assessed by cerebral microdialysis. Results: During ECLS without adrenaline, regional CBF increased by only 5% (25th to 75th percentile: \u00e2\u02c6\u20193 to 14; p = 0.2642) and PbtO2 by 6% (0\u00e2\u20ac\u201c15; p = 0.0073) despite a significant increase in MAP to 28 mmHg (25\u00e2\u20ac\u201c30; p < 0.0001) and CePP to 10 mmHg (8\u00e2\u20ac\u201c13; p < 0.0001).

Objectives Targeted inhibitors of the PI3 kinase (PI3K) pathway have shown promising but incomplete antitumor activity in preclinical chordoma models. The aim of this study is to advance methodology for a high-throughput drug screen using chordoma models to identify new combination therapies for chordoma. Study Design Present work is an in vitro study. Setting The study conducted at an academic research laboratory. Materials and Methods An in vitro study on automated high-throughput screening of chordoma cells was performed using a library of 1,406 drugs as both mono- and combination therapies with PI3K inhibitors. Combination indices were determined for dual therapies and synergistic outliers were identified as potential therapeutic agents. T (brachyury) siRNA knockdown in combination with PI3K pathway inhibition was also assessed. Results Fifty-nine combination therapies were identified as having potential therapeutic efficacy. Effective combinations included PI3K inhibitors with GSK1838705A (ALK/IGF-1R inhibitor), LY2874455 (VEGFR/FGFR inhibitor), El1 (selective Ezh2 inhibitor), and (-)-p-bromotetramisole oxalate (alkaline phosphatase inhibitor). The top ranking targets identified included ALK, PDGFR, VEGFR, aurora kinase, and BCL-2. T (brachyury) inhibition produced significant reduction in cell viability and growth; however PI3K inhibition in combination with T (brachyury) knockdown did not result in further reduction in growth and viability in vitro. Conclusion High throughput with in vitro combination screening is feasible with chordoma cells and allows for rapid identification of synergistic dual-therapies.

Agomelatine, an agonist of melatonergic MT1 and MT2 receptors and a selective 5-hydroxytryptamine 2C receptor antagonist, is widely applied in treating depression and insomnia symptoms in several neurogenerative diseases. However, the neuroprotective effect of agomelatine in Alzheimer\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s disease (AD) is less known. In this study, a total of 30 mice were randomly divided into three groups, namely, wild type (WT), APP/PS1, and agomelatine (50 mg/kg). After 30 days, the Morris water maze was performed to test the cognitive ability of mice. Then, all mice were sacrificed, and the hippocampus tissues were collected for ELISA, Western blot, and immunofluorescence analysis. In this study, we found that agomelatine attenuated spatial memory deficit, amyloid-\u00ce\u00b2 (A\u00ce\u00b2) deposition, tau phosphorylation, and neuroinflammation in the hippocampus of APP/PS1 mice.

In this study, we investigated the relationship between albumin oxidation and sepsis severity in a selected cohort of patients from the Albumin Italian Outcome Study (ALBIOS). A retrospective analysis was conducted on the oxidation forms of human albumin [human mercapto-albumin (HMA), human non-mercapto-albumin form 1 (HNA1) and human non-mercapto-albumin form 2 (HNA2)] in 60 patients with severe sepsis or septic shock and 21 healthy controls. The sepsis patients were randomized (1:1) to treatment with 20% albumin and crystalloid solution or crystalloid solution alone. The albumin oxidation forms were measured at day 1 and day 7. To assess the albumin oxidation forms as a function of oxidative stress, the 60 sepsis patients, regardless of the treatment, were grouped based on baseline sequential organ failure assessment (SOFA) score as surrogate marker of oxidative stress. At day 1, septic patients had significantly lower levels of HMA and higher levels of HNA1 and HNA2 than healthy controls. HMA and HNA1 concentrations were similar in patients treated with albumin or crystalloids at day 1, while HNA2 concentration was significantly greater in albumin-treated patients (p < 0.001). On day 7, HMA was significantly higher in albumin-treated patients, while HNA2 significantly increased only in the crystalloids-treated group, reaching values comparable with the albumin group. When pooling the septic patients regardless of treatment, albumin oxidation was similar across all SOFA groups at day 1, but at day 7 HMA was lower at higher SOFA scores. Mortality rate was independently associated with albumin oxidation levels measured at day 7 (HMA log-rank = 0.027 and HNA2 log-rank = 0.002), irrespective of treatment group. In adjusted regression analyses for 90-day mortality, this effect remained significant for HMA and HNA2. Our data suggest that the oxidation status of albumin is modified according to the time of exposure to oxidative stress (differences between day 1 and day 7). After 7 days of treatment, lower SOFA scores correlate with higher albumin antioxidant capacity. The trend toward a positive effect of albumin treatment, while not statistically significant, warrants further investigation.",

Purpose: Allopurinol is a potent inhibitor of the enzyme xanthine oxidase used primarily in the treatment of hyperuricemia and gout. The aim of this study was to compare the analgesic efficacy of preanesthetic allopurinol versus placebo on postoperative pain and anxiety in patients undergoing abdominal hysterectomy. Methods: This is a prospective, double-blinded, placebo-controlled, randomized clinical trial. We investigated 54 patients scheduled to undergo elective abdominal hysterectomy. Patients were randomly assigned to receive either oral allopurinol 300\u00c2\u00a0mg (n = 27) or placebo (n = 27) the night before and 1\u00c2\u00a0h before surgery. Patients were submitted to evaluation of pain and anxiety before the treatment, for 24\u00c2\u00a0h postoperatively, 30 and 90\u00c2\u00a0days after surgery. Cerebrospinal fluid was collected at the time of the spinal anesthesia to perform the measurement of the central levels of purines. Results: Preoperative administration of allopurinol was effective in reducing postoperative pain 2\u00c2\u00a0h after surgery. Allopurinol caused a reduction of approximately 40% in pain scores measured by the visual analogue pain scale after surgery (p < 0.05).

To counter this case, the anti-NNV potentials of nine drugs with broad-spectrum antiviral activity were explored using ribavirin as a positive drug. Toxicity of the selected drugs to SSN-1 cells and grouper was firstly evaluated to determine the safety concentrations. For screening in vitro, amantadine and oseltamivir phosphate can relieve the cytopathic effects and inhibit NNV replication with the 90% inhibitory concentrations (IC90) of 38.74 and 106.75\u00c2\u00a0mg/L, respectively. Amantadine has a stronger anti-NNV activity than ribavirin at the with- and post-NNV infection stages, indicating that it is a potential therapeutic agent against VER by acting directly on NNV. Similarly, amantadine also has a strong anti-NNV activity in vivo with the IC90 of 27.91\u00c2\u00a0mg/L at the 7\u00c2\u00a0days post-infection, while that was 73.25\u00c2\u00a0mg/L for ribavirin.

Methods: In April 2020, a total of 60 patients and 59 caregivers were administered by phone scales assessing patients\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 QoL (McGill QoL Questionnaire), general health status (EQ-5D-5L), and caregiver burden (Zarit Burden Interview). The administration was repeated one month after the end of lockdown measures, with the addition of a qualitative questionnaire (COVID-QoL Questionnaire) exploring family reorganization and personal perception of lock down. Results: QoL and perceived health status did not worsen during lockdown, while caregiver burden increased (p = 0.01). Patient\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s QoL and caregiver burden were inversely correlated at T1 (ZBI total score mildly correlated with Mc Gill existential subscore, p = 0.02, rho = 0.30 and with Mc Gill total score, p = 0.05, rho = 0.265).

Predicting the fate of nasally administered drugs is important for the understanding and possible improvement of in vivo performance.

Specifically, hybrid CFPD-PBPK simulations can predict inhaled particle transport, deposition, and uptake in the nasal mucus layers and subsequently absorbed drug migration from the nasal cavity to the blood stream.The computer simulation results of Chari et al.

Employing the open-source toolbox OpenFOAM, our PBPK model predictions were compared with experimental in vivo data sets for different corticosteroids. The relative differences between experimental and simulated values of PK metrics, following administration of mometasone furoate nasal spray, were all 7% or less. Drug plasma concentrations based on different drug parameters, such as solubility and partition coefficient, were studied as well. The drug concentration in the plasma was found to increase with an increase in drug solubility (Cs = 0.02 mg/ml, 0.1 mg/ml, 0.2 mg/ml). The same trend was observed for different partition coefficients (Kow = 5e-3, 2, 5000), where the plasma concentration curve peaked for a partition coefficient of 5000. It was also observed that drug dosage controls the amount of residual drug concentrations in the plasma with the passage of time. Two different drug dosages were studied, ie, 50 \u00ce\u00bcg and 800 \u00ce\u00bcg, with the former being completely absorbed in the plasma after 8 h; however, in the latter case the drug was not completely absorbed after that time interval.

BACKGROUND: Implantable medical sensors for monitoring and transmitting physiological signals like blood glucose, blood oxygen, electrocardiogram, and endoscopic video present a new way for health care and disease prevention. Nevertheless, the signals transmitted by implantable sensors undergo significant attenuation as they propagate through various biological tissue layers. OBJECTIVE: This paper mainly aims to investigate the power loss of an out-to-in body wireless radio frequency link at 2.45 GHz. METHODS: Two simulation models including the single-layer human tissue model and three-layer human tissue model were established, applying the finite element method (FEM). Two experiments using physiological saline and excised porcine tissue were conducted to measure the power loss of a wireless radio frequency link at 2.45 GHz. Various communication distances and implantation depths were investigated in our study. RESULTS: The results from our measurements show that each 2 cm increase in implantation depth will result in an additional power loss of about 10 dB. The largest difference in values obtained from the measurements and the simulations is within 4 dB, which indicates that the experiments are in good agreement with the simulations.

Here, we showed the therapeutic efficacy of anti-Treg treatment in a canine model of advanced prostate cancer. Methods We used dogs with naturally occurring prostate cancer to study the molecular mechanism underlying Treg infiltration and the effect of anti-Treg treatment. Tumor-infiltrating Tregs was evaluated by immunohistochemistry, and the association with prognosis was examined in dogs with spontaneous prostate cancer. The molecular mechanism of Treg infiltration was explored by RNA sequencing and protein analyses. A non-randomized canine clinical trial was conducted to define the therapeutic potential of anti-Treg treatment for advanced prostate cancer. Human prostate cancer datasets were analyzed to compare gene expression in dogs and humans. Results Tumor-infiltrating Tregs were associated with poor prognosis in dogs bearing spontaneous prostate cancer. RNA sequencing and protein analyses showed a possible link between the CCL17-CCR4 pathway and the increase of tumor-infiltrating Tregs. Dogs with advanced prostate cancer responded to mogamulizumab, a monoclonal antibody targeting CCR4, with decreased circulating Tregs, improved survival, and low incidence of clinically relevant adverse events. Urinary CCL17 concentration and BRAF V595E mutation were independently predictive of the response to mogamulizumab. Analysis of a transcriptomic dataset of human prostate cancer showed that the CCL17-CCR4 axis correlated with Foxp3.

Background: Gonadotropin-releasing hormone receptor (GnRHR) transmits its signal via two major G\u00ce\u00b1-proteins, primarily G\u00ce\u00b1q and G\u00ce\u00b1i. However, the precise mechanism underlying the functions of G\u00ce\u00b1s signal in prostate cancer cells is still unclear. We have previously identified that GV1001, a fragment of the human telomerase reverse transcriptase, functions as a biased GnRHR ligand to selectively stimulate the G\u00ce\u00b1s/cAMP pathway. Here, we tried to reveal the potential mechanisms of which GV1001-stimulated G\u00ce\u00b1s-cAMP signaling pathway reduces the migration and metastasis of prostate cancer (PCa) cells. Methods: The expression of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT)-related genes was measured by western-blotting and spheroid formation on ultra-low attachment plate was detected after GV1001 treatment. In vivo Spleen-liver metastasis mouse model was used to explore the inhibitory effect of GV1001 on metastatic ability of PCa and the transwell migration assay was performed to identify whether GV1001 had a suppressive effect on cell migration in vitro. In order to demonstrate the interaction between androgen receptor (AR) and YAP1, co-immunoprecipitation (co-IP), immunofluorescence (IF) staining, chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) were performed in LNCaP cells with and without GV1001 treatment. Results: GV1001 inhibited expression of EMT-related genes and spheroid formation. GV1001 also suppressed in vivo spleen-liver metastasis of LNCaP cells as well as cell migration in vitro. GV1001 enhanced the phosphorylation of AR and transcription activity of androgen response element reporter gene through cAMP/protein kinase A pathway. Moreover, GV1001 increased Ser-127 phosphorylation of YAP1 and its ubiquitination, and subsequently decreased the levels of AR-YAP1 binding in the promoter region of the CTGF gene. In contrast, both protein and mRNA levels of NKX3.1 known for tumor suppressor gene and AR-coregulator were upregulated by GV1001 in LNCaP cells. YAP1 knockout using CRISPR/Cas9 significantly suppressed the migration ability of LNCaP cells, and GV1001 did not affect the cell migration of YAP1-deficient LNCaP cells. On the contrary, cell migration was more potentiated in LNCaP cells overexpressing YAP5SA, a constitutively active form of YAP1, which was not changed by GV1001 treatment. Conclusions: Overall, this study reveals an essential role of AR-YAP1 in the regulation of PCa cell migration, and provides evidence that GV1001 could be a novel GnRHR ligand to inhibit metastasis of PCa via the G\u00ce\u00b1s/cAMP pathway.",

Background/Aims: We evaluated whether anti-Saccharomyces cerevisiae antibody (ASCA) titers are associated with diagnostic findings, disease activity, Paris classification phenotypes, and persistence after infliximab (IFX) treatment in children with Crohn's disease (CD). We also investigated the role of ASCA as a predictor of mucosal healing (MH) and clinical remission (CR). Methods: This study included 61 CD patients aged 19 years or younger who were diagnosed and treated between September 2010 and January 2019 and followed for at least 1 year. ASCA was regularly measured at the diagnosis of CD and at least 1 year after IFX therapy. Results: The average follow-up period was 3.8\u00c2\u00b13.4 years (range, 1.0 to 7.2 years). Regression analysis showed that the ASCA titer was the only factor associated with Simple Endoscopic Score for Crohn's Disease (SES-CD) or CR among all the parameters. In patients who had achieved MH (SES-CD=0), ASCA immunoglobulin G (IgG) was not associated with MH, but in patients without MH, ASCA IgG was associated with SES-CD (p=0.005) and CR (p<0.001). The cutoff value of ASCA IgG in patients with CR was 21.8 units. However, there was no difference in the relapse rate between the ASCA IgG-positive and -negative groups during the follow-up period. Conclusions: In patients who have not achieved MH, ASCA IgG is closely related to mucosal damage and CR. Unlike Western studies, ASCA IgG may be more helpful in predicting prognosis than immunoglobulin A in Korean patients, but it is not an appropriate indicator to predict the relapse of CD.",

In Ethiopian traditional medicine practices, Clerodendrum myricoides is utilized for the treatment of diarrhea without scientific evidence. Objective. This study was aimed to evaluate the antidiarrheal activity of 80% methanol extract and fractions of the leaf of Clerodendrum myricoides in mice. Methods. The crude extract was prepared by maceration in 80% methanol and then fractionated using hexane, chloroform, and distilled water. Antidiarrheal activity was assessed by castor oil-induced diarrhea, enteropooling, and gastrointestinal motility models using onset of diarrhea, number and weight of feces, volume and weight of intestinal contents, and distance travelled by charcoal meal as main parameters. Negative controls received either distilled water or 2% Tween 80 (10 ml/kg), positive controls received 3 mg/kg loperamide or 1 mg/kg atropine, and the test groups received 100, 200, and 400 mg/kg doses of the extract. Results. The crude extract and chloroform fraction significantly prolonged the onset of diarrhea at 200 and 400 mg/kg and decreased the number of wet, total, and weight of fresh feces at all tested doses. Hexane fraction has a significant antidiarrheal effect on the onset, number, and weight of feces at 400 mg/kg. The crude extract and chloroform fraction at all tested doses, as well as aqueous fraction at 200 mg/kg and 100 mg/kg, produced significant reduction in volume and weight of intestinal contents. Additionally, hexane fraction showed significant reduction of volume and weight of the intestinal content at 400 mg/kg. In the gastrointestinal motility test model, both chloroform fraction and crude extract at all tested doses and aqueous fraction at 200 mg/kg and 400 mg/kg showed a significant antidiarrheal effect as compared to the negative control.

Background: Antioxidants are small molecules that prevent or delay the process of oxidations caused by highly reactive free radicals. These molecules are known for their ability to protect various cellular architecture and other biomolecules from oxidative stress and free radicals. Thus, antioxidants play a key role in the prevention of oxidative damages caused by highly reactive free radicals. Methods: In the present study, a series of previously synthesized heterocyclic 2-aryl-4(3H)-quinazolinone derivatives 1-25 were screened for antioxidant activity by employing in vitro DPPH and superoxide anion radical scavenging activities. ROS inhibitory activities were also evaluated by serum-opsonized zymosan activated whole blood phagocytes and isolated neutrophils. Cytotoxicity studies were carried out by employing an MTT assay against the 3T3 cell line. Results: Most of the 2-aryl-4(3H)-quinazolinone derivatives showed potent antioxidant activities in superoxide anion radical scavenging assay with IC50 value ranging between 0.57 \u00c2\u00b5M-48.93 \u00c2\u00b5M, as compared to positive control quercetin dihydrate (IC50 = 94.1 \u00c2\u00b1 1.1 \u00c2\u00b5M ).

This study investigated the effect of tramadol on breast cancer progression and metastasis. Methods: The effects of tramadol on two different subtypes of human breast adenocarcinoma cell lines, MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7, were studied with regard to cell growth, migration, colony formation and invasion and normoxic or hypoxic microenvironment for the expression of hypoxia-inducible factor-1\u00ce\u00b1, reactive oxygen species, epithelial-mesenchymal transition related and cyclin-related proteins. The co-administration of tramadol and doxorubicin was studied to determine whether the effective doxorubicin dose might be reduced in combination with tramadol. Results: The results showed that tramadol inhibited cell growth at concentrations more than 0.5 and more than 1.0 mg/mL in MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7 cells, respectively. Additionally, cell migration, colony formation and invasion were inhibited in a dose-dependent manner by tramadol in both cell lines. The combination of tramadol and doxorubicin induced synergistic effects in MDA-MD-231 cells and, with specific dosage combinations in MCF-7 cells.

Patients and Methods: A single-center, open-label, parallel-arm, stratified randomized controlled trial evaluated the therapeutic potential of combination antiviral therapies. Enrolled patients in the severe category were randomized into three groups: (A) standard treatment, (B) hydroxychloroquine+ribavirin+standard treatment, or (C) lopinavir+ritonavir +ribavirin+standard treatment; while the non-severe category comprised two groups: (A) standard treatment or (B) hydroxychloroquine+ribavirin. Combination antivirals were given for 10 days and followed for 28 days. The primary endpoints were safety, symptomatic and laboratory recovery of organ dysfunctions, and time to SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR negative report. Results: In total, 111 patients were randomized: 24, 23, and 24 in severe categories A, B, and C, respectively, and 20 in each of the non-severe groups. Two patients receiving ribavirin experienced drug induced liver injury, and another developed QT prolongation after hydro-xychloroquine.

The purpose of the present study was to shed light on the transformation processes of umifenovir in municipal wastewater, including disinfection with active chlorine, as well as to assess the levels of the antiviral drug and its metabolites entering and accumulating in natural reservoirs under conditions of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. The combination of high-performance liquid chromatography with electrospray ionization high-resolution mass-spectrometry and inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry was used for tentative identification and quantification of umifenovir and its transformation products in model reaction mixtures and real samples of wastewater, river water, biological sludge and bottom sediments taken at the wastewater treatment plant in Arkhangelsk, a large cultural and industrial center at the Russian North. Laboratory experiments allowed identifying fifteen bromine-containing transformation products, forming at the initial stages of the chlorination and fourteen classic volatile and semi volatile disinfection by-products with bromoform as the dominant one.

Introduction: Nilotinib, as the second generation of tyrosine kinase inhibitor, has significant efficacy in patients with chronic myeloid leukemia resistant or intolerant to Imatinib. Aplastic anemia induced by tyrosine kinase inhibitors is an uncommon complication. Case report: A 34-year-old female case with CML in the chronic phase was treated with Imatinib in first-line therapy. Nilotinib was switched because of failure to achieve complete cytogenetic response at 6 months following Imatinib. Three years with Nilotinib, the patient developed a persistent pancytopenia grade 4 while a major molecular response was achieved. Management & Outcome: Nilotinib was discontinued. However, the hematologic finding of the patient had not recovered after three months. A bone marrow biopsy showed marked hypocellularity and fatty tissue without evidence of myelofibrosis. Immunosuppressive therapy was started. Unfortunately, the patient died due to septic and hemorrhagic shock nine months after Nilotinib interruption. According to Naranjo's algorithm, the causality relationship with the drug is probable with a score of 5. Discussion: Aplastic anemia is an uncommon adverse event of tyrosine kinase inhibitors but it can be a fatal complication. The early diagnosis of aplastic anemia related to Nilotinib therapy is needed to avoid further detrimental effects of the drug.",

The purpose was to study the monitoring effect and application value of two-dimensional speckle tracking imaging (2D-STI) on myocardial function in patients with malignant lymphoma after treatment with anthracyclines. Methods. 50 patients with malignant lymphoma treated in our hospital from June 2017 to December 2019 were randomly selected and were treated with anthracyclines to compare the cardiac global longitudinal strain (GLS), global radial strain (GRS), global circumferential strain (GCS), left ventricular twist (LVtw), GLS \u00c3\u2014 LVtw, and changes of atrioventricular inner diameters before and after 3 cycles of treatment. According to the pathological examination results, the accuracy of 2D-STI in the detection of changes in myocardial function of patients was also clarified. Results. The absolute values of GLS, GRS and GCS after treatment were significantly lower than those before treatment, with statistical significance (P < 0.05). The LVtw and GLS \u00c3\u2014 LVtw after 3 cycles of treatment were significantly lower than those before treatment, with statistical significance (P < 0.05). There was no significant difference in the atrioventricular inner diameters of patients before and after treatment, with no statistical significance (P > 0.05). There was no significant difference between the monitoring results of 2D-STI and the pathological examination results, with no statistical significance (P > 0.05). Conclusion. Anthracyclines can cause some myocardial damage in patients with malignant lymphoma.

Introduction: Biologic agents are used in patients with severe psoriasis who have not adequately responded to existing conventional systemic therapies. However, only a limited number of medical institutions in Japan are approved to use them, and their relatively high cost represents a substantial burden to patients. Apremilast is an oral phosphodiesterase-4 inhibitor approved in Japan for the treatment of psoriasis vulgaris in adult patients with an inadequate response to topical therapies and psoriatic arthritis in adult patients with active disease. To date, a large-scale real-world study of treatment patterns and costs associated with apremilast in Japan has not been conducted. The objective of this study was to assess whether apremilast can prolong time to first biologic therapy use and decrease total medical cost. Methods: Using the Medical Data Vision hospital-based claims database, 506 psoriasis patients were propensity score matched and analyzed (apremilast: n = 253; non-apremilast: n = 253). Results: The incidence rate of first biologic therapy use per 1000 patient-years was significantly lower in the apremilast group than in the non-apremilast group (30.3 vs. 107.6; P < 0.001), and the total medical costs per month were significantly lower in the apremilast group than in the non-apremilast group (76,594 yen/month vs. 102,411 yen/month, P < 0.001). In a sensitivity analysis of a propensity-score-matched subset of eligible patients prescribed biologics during the follow-up period (apremilast: n = 14; non-apremilast: n = 14), the incidence of first biologic therapy use was 2,797.6 per 1000 patient-years (95% CI: 1,656.9, 4,723.6) in the non-apremilast group and 856.1 per 1000 patient-years (95% CI: 507.0, 1,445.5) in the apremilast group. Conclusion: These results suggest that apremilast prolongs the time to first biologic therapy use in patients with psoriasis, thereby reducing the total medical cost and decreasing the economic burden on patients.",

Background: A randomized, controlled, phase 3b study (ALPINE) evaluated efficacy and safety of a 2-month formulation of aripiprazole lauroxil (AL) using a 1-day initiation regimen in patients hospitalized for an acute exacerbation of schizophrenia. Paliperidone palmitate (PP) was used as an active control. Exploratory endpoint assessments included severity of illness, positive and negative symptoms, quality of life, caregiver burden, and satisfaction with medication. Methods: Adults were randomly assigned to AL 1064 mg q8wk or PP 156 mg q4wk as inpatients, discharged after 2 weeks, and followed through week 25. Exploratory efficacy measures included the 3 original PANSS subscales, Clinical Global Impression\u00e2\u02c6\u2019Severity (CGI-S) subscale, and caregiver Burden Assessment Scale. Exploratory patient-reported outcomes (PROs) included the Quality of Life Enjoyment and Satisfaction Questionnaire Short Form (Q-LES-Q-SF) and the Medication Satisfaction Questionnaire. Within-group changes from baseline through week 25 were analyzed for AL and PP separately. PROs were summarized based on observed data. Results: Of 200 patients randomized (AL, n = 99; PP, n = 101), 99 completed the study (AL, n = 56; PP, n = 43). For AL, PANSS subscale and CGI-S scores improved from baseline through week 25 (mean [SE] change from baseline at week 25: Positive, \u00e2\u02c6\u20197.5 [0.70]; Negative, \u00e2\u02c6\u20193.9 [0.46]; General, \u00e2\u02c6\u201911.8 [0.83]; CGI-S, \u00e2\u02c6\u20191.3 [0.12]). Caregiver burden also improved (mean [SD] changes from baseline at week 9: \u00e2\u02c6\u20198.4 [10.15]; week 25: \u00e2\u02c6\u20198.9 [12.36]). Most AL patients were somewhat/very satisfied with treatment at each timepoint (70.8%\u00e2\u20ac\u201c74.7%); mean Q-LES-Q-SF total scores were stable in the outpatient period. For PP, results were similar: PANSS Positive, \u00e2\u02c6\u20197.3 (0.67); Negative, \u00e2\u02c6\u20193.6 (0.69); General, \u00e2\u02c6\u201910.9 (1.22); CGI-S, \u00e2\u02c6\u20191.4 (0.16); caregiver burden, week 9: \u00e2\u02c6\u20198.8 (11.89) and week 25: \u00e2\u02c6\u20199.2 (14.55); satisfaction with treatment, 64.7%\u00e2\u20ac\u201c69.3%; and stable Q-LES-Q-SF scores. Conclusions: ALPINE patients initiating the 2-month AL formulation using the 1-day initiation regimen as inpatients and continuing outpatient care experienced schizophrenia symptom improvement, sustained patient satisfaction with medication, stable quality of life, and reduced caregiver burden. A similar benefit pattern was observed for PP. These results support the feasibility of starting either long-acting injectable in the hospital and transitioning to outpatient treatment.

Background Despite unprecedented benefit from immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) in patients with mismatch repair deficient (dMMR)/microsatellite instability high (MSI-H) advanced gastrointestinal cancers, a relevant proportion of patients shows primary resistance or short-term disease control. Since malignant effusions represent an immune-suppressed niche, we investigated whether peritoneal involvement with or without ascites is a poor prognostic factor in patients with dMMR/MSI-H metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) and gastric cancer (mGC) receiving ICIs. Methods We conducted a global multicohort study at Tertiary Cancer Centers and collected clinic-pathological data from a cohort of patients with dMMR/MSI-H mCRC treated with anti-PD-(L)1 \u00c2\u00b1anti-CTLA-4 agents at 12 institutions (developing set). A cohort of patients with dMMR/MSI-high mGC treated with anti-PD-1 agents\u00c2\u00b1chemotherapy at five institutions was used as validating dataset. Results The mCRC cohort included 502 patients. After a median follow-up of 31.2 months, patients without peritoneal metastases and those with peritoneal metastases and no ascites had similar outcomes (adjusted HR (aHR) 1.15, 95% CI 0.85 to 1.56 for progression-free survival (PFS); aHR 0.96, 95% CI 0.65 to 1.42 for overall survival (OS)), whereas inferior outcomes were observed in patients with peritoneal metastases and ascites (aHR 2.90, 95% CI 1.70 to 4.94; aHR 3.33, 95% CI 1.88 to 5.91) compared with patients without peritoneal involvement. The mGC cohort included 59 patients. After a median follow-up of 17.4 months, inferior PFS and OS were reported in patients with peritoneal metastases and ascites (aHR 3.83, 95% CI 1.68 to 8.72; aHR 3.44, 95% CI 1.39 to 8.53, respectively), but not in patients with only peritoneal metastases (aHR 1.87, 95% CI 0.64 to 5.46; aHR 2.15, 95% CI 0.64 to 7.27) when compared with patients without peritoneal involvement. Conclusions Patients with dMMR/MSI-H gastrointestinal cancers with peritoneal metastases and ascites should be considered as a peculiar subgroup with highly unfavorable outcomes to current ICI-based therapies. Novel strategies to target the immune-suppressive niche in malignant effusions should be investigated, as well as next-generation ICIs or intraperitoneal approaches.",

Objectives/Hypothesis: The current state of the U.S. public's knowledge of the relationship between human papillomavirus (HPV) and HPV vaccinations to oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (OPSCC) is unknown. Our objective was to 1) assess the general population's knowledge of human papillomavirus (HPV) and willingness to vaccinate, and 2) assess whether targeted education on HPV-related OPSCC can change intentions to vaccinate. Study Design: Online cross-sectional survey. Methods: An online, cross-sectional survey utilizing U.S. census-derived quotas to represent the U.S. population was distributed and analyzed to 517 adults in 2020. Results: Exactly 72.7% of participants stated that they had or would vaccinate their child against HPV and were designated as \u00e2\u20ac\u0153vaccinators.\u00e2\u20ac\u009d In multivariate regression, Black individuals were less likely to be vaccinators (OR 0.51 [95% CI 0.27\u00e2\u20ac\u201c0.94]), but those who were aware of HPV's role in OPSCC were more likely to vaccinate (OR 2.56 [95% CI 1.47\u00e2\u20ac\u201c4.46]). Knowledge about vaccination side-effects, eligibility, and mechanisms of HPV spread was low. Only 30.6% of the sample reported understanding the role of HPV in OPSCC.

Background Visceral leishmaniasis (VL) is a life-threatening parasitic disease next to malaria, which is responsible for the death of 50,000 patients annually. It has three major clinical stages, including visceral, cutaneous, and mucocutaneous leishmaniasis. Ethiopia is one of the east African countries commonly affected with leishmanisis disease. There are many drugs for leishmaniasis, including sodium stibogluconate and paromomycin combined therapy. However, the adverse effect of those combined drugs is not well-defined. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to assess serum amylase, lipase, and associated factors among patients with VL treatment with those combined drugs. Methods Hospital-based cross-sectional study was conducted at the University of Gondar Comprehensive Specialized Hospital Leishmaniasis Research and Treatment Center from February to September 2020 G.C. Simple random sampling technique was utilized to select study participants. The study participants who fulfill the inclusion criteria were included in the study with written informed consent. 5 ml of blood was withdrawn by an experienced health professional to analyze serum amylase and lipase level. Descriptive data was presented by tables, charts and graphs. Data was cleared, entered by Epi-data version 3.1 then transfer to STATA 14.1 SE version and for analysis paired t-test was used, for factors correlation and regression was used. Those factor variable who have p-value <0.25 was filtered and goes to multivariate regression and p-value <0.05 was considered as significant variables. Results The result of this study showed that there was a significant mean difference between serum pancreatic amylase and lipase before and after treatment. The mean \u00c2\u00b1 SD level of serum amylase after treatment showed a statistically significant elevation (P<0.001) as compared to its level before treatment.

The results of thein vitroanalysis showed that the S-PNT/DNA complexes had a significantly higher DNA release rate and DNA permeation in the duodenum than the L-PNT/DNA complexes. Using Cy5 and TM-rhodamine to individually and chemically conjugate the PNTs with plasmid DNA, we observed, using laser confocal microscopy, that the PNTs and DNA colocalized in complexes. We further confirmed the complexation between DNA and the PNTs using fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET). Data from anin vivoimaging system (IVIS) showed that there was no significant difference (p> 0.05) in PNT distribution between L-PNTs/DNA and S-PNTs/DNA within 4 h. However, the S-PNT/DNA group had a significantly higher DNA distribution (p< 0.05) in several organs, including the ilium, heart, lungs, spleen, kidneys, testes, brain, and spinal cord. Finally, we determined the bcl-xLprotein expression levels in the brain and spinal cord regions for the L-PNT/DNA and S-PNT/DNA complex formulations.

Importance: Persons with immune dysfunction have a higher risk for severe COVID-19 outcomes. However, these patients were largely excluded from SARS-CoV-2 vaccine clinical trials, creating a large evidence gap. Objective: To identify the incidence rate and incidence rate ratio (IRR) for COVID-19 breakthrough infection after SARS-CoV-2 vaccination among persons with or without immune dysfunction. Design, Setting, and Participants: This retrospective cohort study analyzed data from the National COVID Cohort Collaborative (N3C), a partnership that developed a secure, centralized electronic medical record-based repository of COVID-19 clinical data from academic medical centers across the US. Persons who received at least 1 dose of a SARS-CoV-2 vaccine between December 10, 2020, and September 16, 2021, were included in the sample. Main Outcomes and Measures: Vaccination, COVID-19 diagnosis, immune dysfunction diagnoses (ie, HIV infection, multiple sclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis, solid organ transplant, and bone marrow transplantation), other comorbid conditions, and demographic data were accessed through the N3C Data Enclave. Breakthrough infection was defined as a COVID-19 infection that was contracted on or after the 14th day of vaccination, and the risk after full or partial vaccination was assessed for patients with or without immune dysfunction using Poisson regression with robust SEs. Poisson regression models were controlled for a study period (before or after [pre- or post-Delta variant] June 20, 2021), full vaccination status, COVID-19 infection before vaccination, demographic characteristics, geographic location, and comorbidity burden. Results: A total of 664722 patients in the N3C sample were included. These patients had a median (IQR) age of 51 (34-66) years and were predominantly women (n = 378307 [56.9%]). Overall, the incidence rate for COVID-19 breakthrough infection was 5.0 per 1000 person-months among fully vaccinated persons but was higher after the Delta variant became the dominant SARS-CoV-2 strain (incidence rate before vs after June 20, 2021, 2.2 [95% CI, 2.2-2.2] vs 7.3 [95% CI, 7.3-7.4] per 1000 person-months). Compared with partial vaccination, full vaccination was associated with a 28% reduced risk for breakthrough infection (adjusted IRR [AIRR], 0.72; 95% CI, 0.68-0.76). People with a breakthrough infection after full vaccination were more likely to be older and women. People with HIV infection (AIRR, 1.33; 95% CI, 1.18-1.49), rheumatoid arthritis (AIRR, 1.20; 95% CI, 1.09-1.32), and solid organ transplant (AIRR, 2.16; 95% CI, 1.96-2.38) had a higher rate of breakthrough infection. Conclusions and Relevance: This cohort study found that full vaccination was associated with reduced risk of COVID-19 breakthrough infection, regardless of the immune status of patients. Despite full vaccination, persons with immune dysfunction had substantially higher risk for COVID-19 breakthrough infection than those without such a condition. For persons with immune dysfunction, continued use of nonpharmaceutical interventions (eg, mask wearing) and alternative vaccine strategies (eg, additional doses or immunogenicity testing) are recommended even after full vaccination.\n",

Background: \u00ce\u00b2-Blockers have an uncertain effect in heart failure with a preserved ejection fraction of 50% or higher (heart failure with preserved ejection fraction [HFpEF]). Methods and Results: We included patients with HFpEF from the Swedish Heart Failure Registry (SwedeHF) enrolled from 2011 through 2018. In a 2:1 propensity-score matched analysis (\u00ce\u00b2-blocker use vs nonuse), we assessed the primary outcome first HF hospitalization, the coprimary outcome cardiovascular (CV) death, and the secondary outcomes of all-cause hospitalization and all-cause death. We performed intention-to-treat and a per-protocol consistency analyses. There were a total of 14,434 patients (median age 79 years, IQR 71\u00e2\u20ac\u201c85 years, 51% women); 80% were treated with a \u00ce\u00b2-blocker at baseline. Treated patients were younger and had higher rates of atrial fibrillation and coronary artery disease, and higher N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide levels. In the 4412:2206 patient matched cohort, at 5 years, 42% (95% CI 40%\u00e2\u20ac\u201c44%) vs 44% (95% CI 41%\u00e2\u20ac\u201c47%) had a HF admission and 38% (IQR 36%\u00e2\u20ac\u201c40%) vs 40% (IQR 36%\u00e2\u20ac\u201c42%) died from CV causes. In the intention-to-treat analysis, \u00ce\u00b2-blocker use was not associated with HF admissions (hazard ratio 0.95 [95% CI 0.87\u00e2\u20ac\u201c1.05, P = .31]) or CV death (hazard ratio 0.94 [95% CI 0.85\u00e2\u20ac\u201c1.03, P = .19]). In the subgroup analyses, men seemed to have a more favorable association between \u00ce\u00b2-blockers and outcomes than did women. There were no associations between \u00ce\u00b2-blocker use and secondary outcomes. Conclusions: In patients with HFpEF, \u00ce\u00b2-blocker use is common but not associated with changes in HF hospitalization or cardiovascular mortality. In the absence of a strong rational and randomized control trials the case for \u00ce\u00b2-blockers in HFpEF remains inconclusive.

The hypothesis is that milder symptoms indicating altered thrombocyte function may affect a larger proportion of vaccinated individuals than the recently reported severe cases with thrombosis and thrombocytopenia. Methods: Using an ongoing large, population-based cohort study, more than 80 000 cohort participants were asked through electronic questionnaires about COVID-19 vaccination and potential side effects during weeks 11\u00e2\u20ac\u201c13, 2021. The response rate was 58% (81267/138924). Among the vaccinated, 83% were female, 85% health care workers and 80% were aged 40\u00e2\u20ac\u201c55 years. The prevalence of self-reported episodes of skin, nose and gingival bleedings were compared after mRNA and adenovirus-vectored vaccination. Estimates were adjusted for age, sex, occupation, previous COVID-19 infection and chronic disease. Results: Four of the 3416 subjects (0.2%) who were vaccinated with a single dose of mRNA vaccine reported skin bleeding as a side effect, as opposed to 163 of 5132 subjects (3.2%) vaccinated with a single dose of the adenovirus-vectored vaccine, OR (odds ratio) = 16.0 (95% confidence interval (CI) 7.5\u00e2\u20ac\u201c34.1).

Methods In total, 204,418 patients who were tested for SARS-CoV-2 between January and June 2020 were included. For each case patient (n = 7,723) with a positive SARS-CoV-2 test, random controls (n = 46,231) were selected from the target population who had been exposed to someone with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) but had a negative SARS-CoV-2 test result.

Methods: Retrospective review of prospectively maintained database of 511 consecutive patients undergoing TT at an academic teaching hospital. The association between number of parathyroid glands identified intraoperatively and incidence of biochemical hypocalcaemia (defined as any calcium < 2\u00c2\u00a0mmol/L n first 48\u00c2\u00a0h after surgery), symptomatic hypocalcaemia; permanent hypoparathyroidism (defined as any hypocalcaemia or need for calcium or vitamin D > 6\u00c2\u00a0months after surgery), and incidental parathyroidectomy, was investigated.

Exposures: COVID-19 infection diagnosed by polymerase chain reaction within 14 days of consent or receipt of messenger RNA (mRNA) COVID-19 vaccine (BNT162b2 or mRNA-1273). Main Outcomes and Measures: Human milk anti-SARS-CoV-2 receptor-binding domain IgA and IgG and microneutralization activity against live SARS-CoV-2 virus. Results: Of 77 individuals, 47 (61.0%) were in the infection group (mean [SD] age, 29.9 [4.4] years), and 30 (39.0%) were in the vaccinated group (mean [SD] age, 33.0 [3.4] years; P =.002). The mean (SD) age of infants in the infection and vaccinated group were 3.1 (2.2) months and 7.5 (5.2) months, respectively (P <.001). Infection was associated with a variable human milk IgA and IgG receptor-binding domain-specific antibody response over time that was classified into different temporal patterns: upward trend and level trend (33 of 45 participants [73%]) and low/no response (12 of 45 participants [27%]). Infection was associated with a robust and quick IgA response in human milk that was stable out to 90 days after diagnosis. Vaccination was associated with a more uniform IgG-dominant response with concentrations increasing after each vaccine dose and beginning to decline by 90 days after the second dose. Vaccination was associated with increased human milk IgA after the first dose only (mean [SD] increase, 31.5 [32.6] antibody units). Human milk collected after infection and vaccination exhibited microneutralization activity. Microneutralization activity increased throughout time in the vaccine group only (median [IQR], 2.2 [0] before vaccine vs 10 [4.0] after the first dose; P =.003) but was higher in the infection group (median [IQR], 20 [67] at day 28) vs the vaccination group after the first-dose human milk samples (P =.002). Both IgA and non-IgA (IgG-containing) fractions of human milk from both participants with infection and those who were vaccinated exhibited microneutralization activity against SARS-CoV-2. Conclusions and Relevance: In this cohort study of a convenience sample of lactating parents, the pattern of IgA and IgG antibodies in human milk differed between COVID-19 infection vs mRNA vaccination out to 90 days.

Design, Setting, and Participants: This population-based cohort study used data from nationwide registries in Finland to assess all singleton live births (N = 1 012 723) between January 1, 1996, and December 31, 2014. Offspring were followed up until December 31, 2018 (when the oldest reached age 22 years). Exclusion criteria were maternal inpatient psychiatric diagnoses and pregestational diabetes. The study and data analysis were conducted from May 1, 2020, to June 1, 2021. Exposures: Preeclampsia and perinatal complications (delivery earlier than 34 weeks' gestation and/or small for gestational age). Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary outcomes were neurodevelopmental and psychiatric diagnoses and dispensation of psychotropic drugs among offspring until December 31, 2018. Cox proportional hazards regression analyses were performed to assess the associations. Results: Of 1 012 723 singleton live births (51.1% boys; mean [SD] maternal age at birth, 30.0 [5.4] years; specific data on race and ethnicity were not available in the data set), 21 010 children (2.1%) were exposed to preeclampsia alone, 33 625 children (3.3%) were exposed to perinatal complications alone, and 4891 children (0.5%) were exposed to both preeclampsia and perinatal complications. A total of 93 281 children (9.2%) were diagnosed with a neurodevelopmental or psychiatric disorder. Offspring exposed to both preeclampsia and perinatal complications had an increased risk of any neurodevelopmental or psychiatric disorder after adjusting for potential confounding (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR], 2.11; 95% CI, 1.96-2.26) compared with those not exposed to either preeclampsia or perinatal complications; this risk was higher than exposure to either preeclampsia alone (aHR, 1.18; 95% CI, 1.12-1.23) or perinatal complications alone (aHR, 1.77; 95% CI, 1.72-1.82). Sibling pair analyses did not detect any increase in the risk of neurodevelopmental or psychiatric disorders after exposure to preeclampsia alone, but offspring exposed to both preeclampsia and perinatal complications had increased risks of intellectual disabilities (aHR, 3.24; 95% CI, 1.05-10.06), specific developmental disorders (aHR, 3.56; 95% CI, 2.35-5.41), ADHD and conduct disorders (aHR, 2.42; 95% CI, 1.09-5.39), and other behavioral and emotional disorders (aHR, 2.45; 95% CI, 1.17-5.13). The risk estimates for specific developmental disorders (aHR, 2.82; 95% CI, 2.60-3.05) and ADHD and conduct disorders (aHR, 1.88; 95% CI, 1.65-2.14) were higher among offspring exposed to both preeclampsia and perinatal complications compared with those exposed to perinatal complications alone (aHR, 2.26 [95% CI, 2.18-2.33] and 1.60 [95% CI, 1.52-1.68], respectively). Conclusions and Relevance: In this study, exposure to both maternal preeclampsia and perinatal complications was associated with intellectual disabilities, specific developmental disorders, ADHD and conduct disorders, and other behavioral and emotional disorders in offspring. For specific developmental disorders and ADHD and conduct disorders, the risk estimates were higher among offspring exposed to both preeclampsia and perinatal complications compared with those exposed to perinatal complications only.",

Background: Exposure to radiation is related to breast cancer occurrence. While whether the radioiodine (RAI) increases the risk of second breast cancer (SBC) in female differentiated thyroid cancer (DTC) patients is not well addressed. Methods: All patients were identified from Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results database. At least a 5-year latency was guaranteed since exposure to RAI. Fine and Gray model was used to calculate the cumulative incidence and hazards ratios (HR) and 95% confidence interval (CI). Standardized incidence ratio (SIR) was calculated by Poisson regression analysis. Propensity score matching was used for match analysis. Survival analyses were performed by the Kaplan-Meier method and the log-rank test. Results: A total of 406 out of 16,850 patients in the RAI group and 733 out of 22,135 patients in the no RAI group developed SBC. The cumulative incidences of SBC were higher in patients with RAI compared with patients without RAI in the adolescent and young adult (AYA) group and the middle-aged adult group. In the AYA group, patients with RAI had increased HR (1.65; 95% CI, 1.33\u00e2\u20ac\u201c2.05, p\u00c2\u00a0<\u00c2\u00a00.001) compared with those without RAI, and the HR increased slightly with latency.

Whereas, in the middle-aged adult group, only a slightly higher HR (1.18) was found. The survival after SBC was inferior to those with matched only primary breast cancer.

Importance: The optimal systolic blood pressure (SBP) to minimize the risk of dementia in older age is unknown. Objective: To investigate whether the association between SBP and dementia risk is U-shaped and whether age and comorbidity play a role in this association. Design, Setting, and Participants: This cohort study used an individual participant data approach to analyze 7 prospective, observational, population-based cohort studies that were designed to evaluate incident dementia in older adults. These studies started between 1987 and 2006 in Europe and the US. Participants had no dementia diagnosis and had SBP and/or diastolic blood pressure (BP) data at baseline and incident dementia status during follow-up. Data analysis was conducted from November 7, 2019, to October 3, 2021. Exposures: Baseline systolic BP. Main Outcomes and Measures: All-cause dementia (defined using Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders [Third Edition Revised] or Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders [Fourth Edition] and established at follow-up measurements or in clinical practice), mortality, and combined dementia and mortality were the outcomes. Covariates included baseline antihypertensive medication use, sex, educational level, body mass index, smoking status, diabetes, stroke history, myocardial infarction history, and polypharmacy. Cox proportional hazards regression models were used, and nonlinear associations were explored using natural splines. Results: The study analyzed 7 cohort studies with a total of 17286 participants, among whom 10393 were women (60.1%) and the mean (SD) baseline age was 74.5 (7.3) years. Overall, dementia risk was lower for individuals with higher SBP, with the lowest risk associated with an SBP of approximately 185 mm Hg (95% CI, 161-230 mm Hg; P =.001). Stratified by overlapping 10-year baseline age groups, the lowest dementia risk was observed at somewhat lower systolic BP levels in those older than 75 years (158 [95% CI, 152-178] mm Hg to 170 [95% CI, 160-260] mm Hg). For mortality, there was a clear U-shaped association, with the lowest risk at 160 mm Hg (95% CI, 154-181 mm Hg; P <.001). This U-shape occurred across all age groups, with the lowest dementia risk associated with an SBP of 134 mm Hg (95% CI, 102-149 mm Hg; P =.03) in those aged 60 to 70 years and increasing to between 155 mm Hg (95% CI, 150-166 mm Hg; P <.001) and 166 mm Hg (95% CI, 154-260 mm Hg; P =.02) for age groups between 70 and 95 years. Combined dementia and mortality risk curves closely resembled those for mortality. Associations of diastolic BP with dementia risk were generally similar but were less distinct. Conclusions and Relevance: This cohort study found that dementia risk was lower for older individuals with higher SBP levels and that more distinctly U-shaped associations appeared for those older than 75 years, but these associations cannot be explained by SBP-associated changes in mortality risk. The findings may warrant future trials on tailored BP management in older age groups that take life expectancy and health context into consideration.\n",

Recent animal and small clinical studies have suggested depression is related to altered lipid and amino acid profiles. However, this has not been examined in a population-based sample, particularly in women. We identified multiple metabolites associated with depression as potential candidates from prior studies. Cross-sectional data from three independent samples of postmenopausal women were analyzed, including women from the Women\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Health Initiative-Observational Study (WHI-OS, n = 926), the WHI-Hormone Trials (WHI-HT; n = 1,325), and the Nurses\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 Health Study II Mind-Body Study (NHSII-MBS; n = 218). Positive depression status was defined as having any of the following: elevated depressive symptoms, antidepressant use, or depression history. Plasma metabolites were measured using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (21 phosphatidylcholines (PCs), 7 lysophosphatidylethanolamines, 5 ceramides, 3 branched chain amino acids, and 9 neurotransmitters). Associations between depression status and metabolites were evaluated using multivariable linear regression; results were pooled by random-effects meta-analysis with multiple testing adjustment using the false discovery rate (FDR). Prevalence rates of positive depression status were 24.4% (WHI-OS), 25.7% (WHI-HT), and 44.7% (NHSII-MBS). After multivariable adjustment, positive depression status was associated with higher levels of glutamate and PC 36 : 1/38 : 3, and lower levels of tryptophan and GABA-to-glutamate and GABA-to-glutamine ratio (FDR-p < 0.05). Positive associations with LPE 18 : 0/18 : 1 and inverse associations with valine and serotonin were also observed, although these associations did not survive FDR adjustment.

Dietary change leads to a precipitous increase in non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) from simple steatosis to the advanced form of non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), affecting approximately 25% of the global population. Although significant efforts greatly advance progress in clarifying the pathogenesis of NAFLD and identifying therapeutic targets, no therapeutic agent has been approved. Astaxanthin (ASTN), a natural antioxidant product, exerts an anti-inflammation and anti-fibrotic effect in mice induced with carbon tetrachloride (CCl4 ) and bile duct ligation (BDL); thus, we proposed to further investigate the potential effect of ASTN on a diet-induced mouse NASH and liver fibrosis, as well as the underlying cellular and molecular mechanisms. By treating predevelopment of NASH in mice induced with a choline-deficient, L-amino acid-defined, high-fat diet (CDAHFD), we have demonstrated that oral administration ASTN preventively ameliorated NASH development and liver fibrosis by modulating the hepatic immune response, liver inflammation, and oxidative stress. Specifically, ASTN treatment led to the reduction in liver infiltration of monocytederived macrophages, hepatic stellate cell (HSC) activation, oxidative stress response, and hepatocyte death, accompanied by the decreased hepatic gene expression of proinflammatory cytokines such as TNF-\u00ce\u00b1, TGF-\u00ce\u00b21, and IL-1\u00ce\u00b2. In vitro studies also demonstrated that ASTN significantly inhibited the expression of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokine CCL2 in macrophages in response to lipopolysaccharide (LPS) stimulation.

There are not yet studies linking ADHD and the new emergent phenomenon of chemsex, that is, the action of use the intravenous injection of substances in sex parties, with the objective of maximising the practising time and sexual experience. In these sessions, different types of drug are used, for example, synthetic cathinone or mephedrone, and may lead to diverse medical and psychiatric complications like psychosis, aggressiveness and suicide ideation. Case: We report the case of a 44-year-old man admitted into a psychiatric unit, presenting with 2nd time suicidal high risk attempt using intravenous methamphetamine and a dissolvent acid in the context of a depressive episode, after practising chemsex sessions almost every weekend with psychoactive substances taken orally, intravenously and intrarectally.

In this study we investigated the effect of a combination of 2-deoxy-D-glucose with lovastatin (a known inhibitor of mevalonate pathway and oxidative phosphorylation) on growth of KRAS-mutant human colorectal cancer cell lines HCT116 and LoVo.

The combined treatment also reduced cellular oxygen consumption and extracellular acidification rate, resulting in decreased production of ATP and lower steady-state ATP levels. Energy depletion markedly activated AMPK, inhibited mTOR and RAS signaling pathways, eventually inducing autophagy, the cellular pro-survival process under metabolic stress, whereas inhibition of autophagy by chloroquine (6.25 \u00ce\u00bcM) enhanced the cytotoxic effect of the combination of lovastatin and 2-deoxy-D-glucose. These in vitro experiment results were reproduced in a nude mouse xenograft model of HCT116 cells. Our findings suggest that concurrently targeting glycolysis, oxidative phosphorylation, and autophagy may be a promising regimen for the management of RAS-driven colorectal cancers.",

Introduction: In the JAVELIN Lung 200 trial, avelumab (anti-programmed death-ligand 1 [PD-L1] antibody) did not significantly prolong overall survival (OS) versus docetaxel in patients with platinum-treated PD-L1+ NSCLC. We report greater than 2-year follow-up data. Methods: Patients with stage IIIB or IV or recurrent NSCLC with disease progression after platinum-doublet chemotherapy were randomized 1:1 to avelumab 10 mg/kg every 2 weeks or docetaxel 75 mg/m2 every 3 weeks. The primary end point was OS in patients with PD-L1+ tumors (greater than or equal to 1% tumor cell expression; IHC 73-10 pharmDx assay). Results: Of 792 patients, 529 had PD-L1+ tumors (264 versus 265 in the avelumab versus docetaxel arms, respectively). As of March 4, 2019, median duration of follow-up for OS in the PD-L1+ population was 35.4 months in the avelumab arm and 34.7 months in the docetaxel arm; study treatment was ongoing in 25 (9.5%) versus 0 patients, respectively. In the PD-L1+ population, 2-year OS rates (95% confidence interval [CI]) with avelumab versus docetaxel were 29.9% (24.5%\u00e2\u20ac\u201c35.5%) versus 20.5% (15.6%\u00e2\u20ac\u201c25.8%); in greater than or equal to 50% PD-L1+ subgroups, 2-year OS rates were 36.4% (29.1%\u00e2\u20ac\u201c43.7%) versus 17.7% (11.8%\u00e2\u20ac\u201c24.7%) and in the greater than or equal to 80% subgroup were 40.2% (31.3%\u00e2\u20ac\u201c49.0%) versus 20.3% (12.9%\u00e2\u20ac\u201c28.8%), respectively. Median duration of response (investigator assessed) was 19.1 months (95% CI: 10.8\u00e2\u20ac\u201c34.8) versus 5.7 months (95% CI: 4.1\u00e2\u20ac\u201c8.3). Safety profiles for both arms were consistent with the primary analysis. Conclusions: Although the JAVELIN Lung 200 primary analysis (reported previously) revealed that avelumab did not significantly prolong OS versus docetaxel in patients with platinum-treated PD-L1+ NSCLC, posthoc analyses at 2 years of follow-up revealed that 2-year OS rates were doubled with avelumab in subgroups with higher PD-L1 expression (greater than or equal to 50% and greater than or equal to 80%).",

Purpose: Endovascular coil occlusion is a successful and rapidly evolving strategy used to treat patients who present with intracranial aneurysms. This study aimed to compare the safety and efficacy of the Avenir\u00c2\u00ae and AxiumTM passive mechanically detachable coil systems. Methods: A prospective, multicenter, randomized controlled study was carried out at ten medical centers from March 2018 to December 2019. A series of consecutive patients diagnosed with intracranial aneurysms were randomly assigned to undergo endovascular treatment with either the Avenir\u00c2\u00ae or the AxiumTM mechanically detachable coil systems. The short-term outcomes from the two groups were compared with a focus on treatment efficacy and safety. Results: A total of 162 and 161 patients were enrolled in the Avenir and Axium groups, respectively. The rate of successful coil detachment was 100% for the Avenir group and 99.38% for the Axium group. At the six-month follow-up visit, the overall aneurysm occlusion rate was 94.66% for the Avenir group and 96.95% for the Axium group (p > 0.05).

Introduction Diabetic sensorimotor polyneuropathy (DSPN) affects approximately 30% of people with diabetes, while around half of cases are symptomatic. Currently, there are only few pathogenetically oriented pharmacotherapies for DSPN, one of which is benfotiamine, a prodrug of thiamine with a high bioavailability and favourable safety profile. While benfotiamine has shown positive effects in preclinical and short-term clinical studies, no long-term clinical trials are available to demonstrate disease-modifying effects on DSPN using a comprehensive set of disease-related endpoints. Methods and analysis The benfotiamine on morphometric, neurophysiological and clinical measures in patients with type 2 diabetes trial is a randomised double-blind, placebo-controlled parallel group monocentric phase II clinical trial to assess the effects of treatment with benfotiamine compared with placebo in participants with type 2 diabetes and mild to moderate symptomatic DSPN. Sixty participants will be 1:1 randomised to treatment with benfotiamine 300 mg or placebo two times a day over 12 months.

Background: Epidemiological and clinical evidence suggests that diabetes increases the risk of liver cancer. Although the co-occurrence of type 2 diabetes (T2D) and liver cancer is becoming more frequent, the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Even though baicalin, extensively used in traditional Chinese medicine (TCM), can control T2D and inhibit liver cancer separately, minimal research is available regarding its possible effect on T2D-induced liver cancer. Thus, in the present study, we aimed to investigate the role of baicalin in T2D-induced hepatocellular cancer, and for the first time, we particularly emphasized the regulation of baicalin in genes RNA m6A in hepatocellular cancer. Methods: Here, we constructed a cell culture model under a high concentration of glucose and a T2D-induced liver tumor model to evaluate the in vitro and in vivo role of baicalin in T2D-induced liver cancer progression. After confirming the suppressive effect of baicalin and the HKDC1 antibody on T2D-induced liver tumors, the epigenetic alterations (DNA 5mC and RNA m6A) of the baicalin-regulated HKDC1 gene were detected using MS and q-PCR. Next, the METTL3 gene-regulated m6A (2854 site) was investigated using SELECT PCR. Finally, the impact of the other three baicalin analogs (baicalein, wogonoside, and wogonin) on tumor inhibition was tested in vivo while verifying the related RNA m6A mechanism. Results: The results showed that baicalin and the HKDC1 antibody suppressed T2D-induced liver tumor progression in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, baicalin significantly inhibited the epigenetic modification (DNA 5mC and RNA m6A) of HKDC1 in HepG2 tumors, mainly targeting the RNA m6A site (2854). The m6A-related gene, METTL3, regulated the RNA m6A site (2854) of HKDC1, which was also restricted by baicalin. Moreover, the study verified that baicalin regulated the METTL3/HKDC1/JAK2/STAT1/caspase-3 pathway in liver cancer cells when exposed to a high glucose concentration. In addition, the three baicalin analogs were proven to regulate the m6A (2854 site) of HKDC1 and suppress T2D-induced liver tumors. Conclusions: The findings of this study revealed that baicalin suppressed T2D-induced liver tumor progression by regulating the METTL3/m6A/HKDC1 axis, which might support its potential application for preventing and treating T2D-induced liver cancer.",

Methods: This post hoc analysis pooled data from the phase 3 FREEDOMS and FREEDOMS II trials (N\u00c2\u00a0=\u00c2\u00a01556). We assessed the correlation between baseline patient demographic and disease characteristics and baseline 3-second Paced Auditory Serial Addition Test (PASAT-3) scores (Spearman's rank test) and the changes from baseline in PASAT-3 (mixed model repeated measures model) in the fingolimod and placebo (up to 24\u00c2\u00a0months) or placebo-fingolimod switched (from Month 24 up to 120\u00c2\u00a0months) groups. Additionally, the predictive value of PASAT-3 score for future disease outcomes was assessed (Cox or logistic regression models). Results: Among the variables assessed, lower PASAT-3 score at baseline correlated with higher disease burden (total brain volume, T2 lesion volume, and Expanded Disability Status Scale score), longer disease duration and older age (p\u00c2\u00a0<\u00c2\u00a00.0001 for all).

Before the rats were sacrificed, visceral sensation and depressive behaviors were evaluated. Then colonic tryptase was measured and microglial activation in the dorsal lumbar spinal cord was assessed. The fecal microbiota was profiled using 16S rRNA sequencing, and short chain fatty acids (SCFAs) were measured. We showed that berberine treatment significantly alleviated chronic WAS-induced visceral hypersensitivity and activation of colonic mast cells and microglia in the dorsal lumbar spinal cord. Transfer of fecal samples from berberine-treated stressed donors to GF rats protected against acute WAS. FMT from a patient with IBS induced visceral hypersensitivity and pro-inflammatory phenotype in microglia, while berberine treatment reversed the microglial activation and altered microbial composition and function and SCFA profiles in stools of IBS-FMT rats. We demonstrated that berberine did not directly influence LPS-induced microglial activation in vitro.

However, the mechanism by which BBR affects intestinal bacteria and immunity is still unclear. Methods: This study investigated the effects of BBR on intestinal bacteria and the inflammatory response in dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced colitis mice. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) and electron microscopy were used to detect intestinal TJs. Microflora analysis was used to screen for bacteria regulated by BBR. Results: The results showed that BBR had increased colonic epithelium zonula occludens proteins-1 (ZO-1) and occludin expression and reduced T-helper 17/T regulatory ratio in DSS-induced mice. Mechanically, BBR eliminated DSS-induced intestinal flora disturbances in mice, particularly increased Bacteroides fragilis (B. fragilis) in vivo and in vitro. B. fragilis decreased the interleukin-6 induced by dendritic cells through some heat-resistant component rather than nucleic acids or proteins.

The aim of the present study is\u00c2\u00a0to explore the preventive efficacy of betulin (BE) in 7,12-dimethylbenz(a)anthracene (DMBA)-administered mammary cancer by modulating Ahr/Nrf2 signaling in experimental models. The mammary cancer was stimulated by the addition of DMBA (25 mg/kg/b.Wt) mixed in 1 ml of vehicle solution (sunflower oil and saline 1:1) through subcutaneous injection. The DMBA-exposed mammary tumor models showed low bodyweight, elevated quantities of lipid peroxidation molecules (TBARS and LOOH), and low enzymatic (GPx, SOD, and CAT), and nonenzymatic (GSH, vitamin C, and vitamin E) antioxidant activities in plasma and mammary tissues. Moreover, histopathological studies confirmed that invasive ductal carcinoma was observed in DMBA-induced mammary tissue of the experimental model. Dietary oral supplementation of BE prevents the loss of bodyweight, overproduces lipid peroxidation, and restores the antioxidant activities in DMBA-exposed experimental animals. The nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) is a crucial antioxidant protein that involves preventing numerous cancers. Therefore, Nrf2-associated signaling concern is a significant target for preventing mammary cancer. This study observed an increased expression of MAPKs, Keap1, ARNT, AhR, and CYP1A1, whereas decreased expression of HO-1 and Nrf2 in DMBA-induced cancer-bearing experimental animals. The oral supplementation of BE effectively modulates the expression of MAPKs, AhR/Nrf2-associated protein expressions in DMBA-exposed experimental animals. This current study concluded that BE is a strong antioxidant, which triggers the MAPKs-mediated oxidative stress and inhibits proliferative markers by restoring the activity of Nrf2 signaling.",

Antidepressants were originally designed and marketed to treat depression and anxiety disorders, but they are also an off-label option that should be considered by clinicians in specialties other than psychiatry, particularly for the treatment of chronic pain. Chronic pain is considered one of the most costly and disabling medical conditions. There are many different treatment options available for patients that suffer from chronic pain, ranging from pharmacological therapy to surgical interventions. Antidepressants are used to treat a variety of chronic pain conditions including peripheral neuropathy, headache, and more recently, fibromyalgia. In this regard, recent studies have proven their effectiveness, and given further understanding of their mechanisms, drug-drug interactions, and adverse effects. The first antidepressants to have been used in this indication are the tricyclic antidepressants. They remain benchmark products, even though newer antidepressants, such as serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors, venlafaxine, milnacipran and duloxetine, or other atypical antidepressants, such as bupropion, are increasingly used, in part because of their better tolerability. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, on the other hand, appear to have no analgesic effects. Prescription of antidepressants offers an alternative and adjunct therapeutic option for patients with chronic pain of various modalities. It is also hoped that treating chronic pain with antidepressants could lead to a decrease in the use of opioid analgesics and also improve many of the concurrent psychiatric conditions associated with chronic pain. Further evidence-based research is still needed to establish better safety profiles and efficacy of antidepressant use in patients with chronic pain.",

Purpose: To discover the possible target of biochanin A (BCA) in the lipid metabolism pathway and further explore its mechanism to nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). Methods: We adopted a high-fat and high-glucose diet for 12 weeks to build the NAFLD rat model, which was then treated with different proportions of BCA for 4 weeks. General condition, body weight, Lee index, and liver index were then evaluated. Furthermore, blood lipid level and insulin resistance (IR) were detected. Moreover, hematoxylin and eosin and oil red O staining were used to observe the pathological changes in the liver. Finally, Western blotting was used to detect the protein expression levels of CYP7A1, HMGCR, LDLR, PPAR-\u00ce\u00b1, PPAR-\u00ce\u00b3, and SREBP-1c in the liver. Results: The vital signs of rats in each group were stable. The treatment with BCA effectively reduced Lee index and liver index (F = 104.781, P < 0.05); however, the weight was not effected in each group. Additionally, BCA effectively reduced the related lipid metabolism indexes of NAFLD, such as total cholesterol (TC), triglyceride (TG), low-density lipoprotein (LDL), blood glucose, insulin, IR (F =12.463 (TC), 6.909 [TG], and 15.3 effected 75 [LDL], P < 0.05), and increased HDL (F = 11.580, P < 0.05). We observed that BCA could significantly improve steatosis and inflammatory cell infiltration in liver slices. Furthermore, BCA significantly increased the CYP7A1, LDLR, and PPAR-\u00ce\u00b1 protein expression in the liver and downregulated the HMGCR, SREBP-1c, and PPAR-\u00ce\u00b3 protein expression. Conclusion: BCA could delay the liver damage of NAFLD induced by a high-fat diet, regulate the blood lipid level, and improve the expression of lipid metabolism-related genes in rats.",

The inflammatory response is an obstacle to success in both allogeneic and autologous islet transplantation. In autologous islet transplantation (AIT), however, the recipient is also the donor, permitting pretreatment of donor/recipient for a controlled duration prior to transplantation. We sought to exploit this feature of (AIT) by pretreating donor/recipients with chronic pancreatitis undergoing total pancreatectomy and autologous islet transplantation (TPAIT) to test the hypothesis that peri-transplant treatment with the FDA-approved anti-inflammatory hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) improves graft function. In this randomized placebo-controlled pilot clinical study, patients (n = 6) were treated with oral HCQ for 30 days prior to and 90 days after TPAIT. In vivo islet function was assessed via Mixed Meal Tolerance Testing before HCQ treatment, 6- and 12-months after surgery. In vitro islet bioenergetics were assessed at the time of transplantation via extracellular flux analysis of islet preparation samples from the clinical trial cohort and six additional patients (n = 12). Our study shows that HCQ did not alter clinical endpoints, but HCQ-treated patients showed greater spare respiratory capacity (SRC) compared to samples from control patients (P=0.028). Glycolytic metabolism of islet preparations directly correlated with stimulated C-peptide secretion both before and after TPAIT (P=0.01, R2=0.489 and P=0.03, R2=0.674, respectively), and predicted in vivo islet function better than mitochondrial metabolism of islet preps or islet equivalents infused. Overnight culture of islet preparations altered bioenergetic function, significantly decreasing SRC and maximal respiration (P<0.001). In conclusion, while HCQ did not alter clinical outcomes, it was associated with significantly increased SRC in islet preparations. Bioenergetic analyses of islet preparations suggests that culture should be avoided and that glycolysis may be a more sensitive indicator of in vivo islet function than current metrics, including islet oxygen consumption and islet equivalents infused.",

Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is the most common motor neuron (MN) disease, with no present cure. The progressive loss of MNs is the hallmark of ALS. We have previously shown the therapeutic effects of the phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) inhibitor, potassium bisperoxo (picolinato) vanadium (bpV[pic]), in models of neurological injury and demonstrated significant neuroprotective effects on MN survival. However, accumulating evidence suggests PTEN is detrimental for MN survival in ALS. Therefore, we hypothesized that treating the mutant superoxide dismutase 1 G93A (mSOD1G93A) mouse model of ALS during motor neuron degeneration and an in vitro model of mSOD1G93A motor neuron injury with bpV(pic) would prevent motor neuron loss. To test our hypothesis, we treated mSOD1G93A mice intraperitoneally daily with 400\u00c2\u00a0\u00ce\u00bcg/kg bpV(pic) from 70 to 90\u00c2\u00a0days of age. Immunolabeled MNs and microglial reactivity were analyzed in lumbar spinal cord tissue, and bpV(pic) treatment significantly ameliorated ventral horn motor neuron loss in mSOD1G93A mice (p = 0.003) while not significantly altering microglial reactivity (p = 0.701). Treatment with bpV(pic) also significantly increased neuromuscular innervation (p = 0.018) but did not affect muscle atrophy. We also cultured motor neuron-like NSC-34 cells transfected with a plasmid to overexpress mutant SOD1G93A and starved them in serum-free medium for 24\u00c2\u00a0h with and without bpV(pic) and downstream inhibitor of Akt signaling, LY294002. In vitro, bpV(pic) improved neuronal viability, and Akt inhibition reversed this protective effect (p < 0.05). In conclusion, our study indicates systemic bpV(pic) treatment could be a valuable neuroprotective therapy for ALS.",

Background/Aims: Bisphosphonates are increasingly recognized for their anti-neoplastic properties, which are the result of their action on the mevalonate pathway. Our primary aim was to investigate the association between bisphosphonate use and survival in patients with pancreatic cancer. Since statins also act on the mevalonate pathway, we also investigated the effect of the combined use of bisphosphonates and statins on survival. Methods: The Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results registry (SEER)-Medicare linked database was used to identify patients with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) between 2007 and 2015. Kaplan-Meier models were used to examine the association between survival with bisphosphonate use alone and in combination with statins within 1 year prior to the diagnosis of PDAC. Propensity score matching analysis and Cox-proportional hazard models were used to determine the association between overall survival with bisphosphonate use alone and combined with statins, after adjusting for relevant confounders, such as the Charlson comorbidity index score, stage, treatment, sociodemographic characteristics, and propensity score. Results: In total, 13,639 patients with PDAC were identified, and 1,203 (8.82%) used bisphosphonates. There was no difference in the mean survival duration between bisphosphonate users (7.27 months) and nonusers (7.25 months, p=0.61). After adjustment for confounders, bisphosphonate use was still not associated with improved survival (hazard ratio, 1.00; 95% confidence interval, 0.93 to 1.08; p=0.96).

Immune profiling of severe COVID-19 patients has identified a complex pattern of cytokines including granulocyte macrophage-colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF) and interleukin (IL)-5, which are significant mediators of viral-induced hyperinflammation. This strong response has prompted the development of therapies that block GM-CSF and other cytokines individually to limit inflammation related pathology. The common cytokine binding site of the human common beta (\u00ce\u00b2c) receptor signals for three inflammatory cytokines: GM-CSF, IL-5 and IL-3.

Results: Average age of patients was 34.8 years (\u00c2\u00b1 9.6). 92.4% of them with CD4 count > 200 cel/\u00ce\u00bcL. At week 12 after starting treatment, both TDF [increase in PN1P (31.7%, p = 0.004), TRAP (11.1%, p = 0.003), OPN (19.3%, p = 0.045) and OC (38.6%, p = 0.001); decrease in OPG (-23.4%, p = 0.003)] and TAF [increase in 42.6% for CTX (p = 0.011), 27.3% for OC (p = 0.001) and 21% for TRAP (p = 0.008); decrease in OPG (-28.8%, p = 0.049)] presented a deep resorption profile compared to ABC, these differences in bone molecular markers, a tendency to equalize at week 48, where no significant differences were observed. Patients treated with TDF showed the greatest decrease in Z-score in both lumbar spine (LS) and femoral neck (FN) at week 48 without statistically significant differences. Conclusion: Treatment-na\u00c3\u00afve HIV patients have a high prevalence of low bone density. Treatment with TDF is associated with greater bone deterioration at 12 and 48 weeks. TAF seems to present similar early bone deterioration at 12 weeks which disappears at 48 weeks.",

Objective: We explored the association of prostate cryotherapy and immunomodulation with granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GMCSF) in the generation of detectable tumor-specific T- and B-cell responses in men with prostate cancer. Materials and methods: A randomized pilot study of patients assigned to either cryotherapy alone (Control group) or in combination with GMCSF (Treatment group). The impact of therapy on the development of T- and B-cell responses against tumor-related antigens was studied using enzyme-linked immune absorbent spot (ELISpot) and protein microarray panels (Sematrix) assays, respectively. Fold changes in response to treatment were calculated by normalization of post-treatment ELISpot values against the mean pre-cryoablation response. Student t tests between treatment and control groups at 4 weeks and 12 weeks across all the antigens were performed. Results: A total of 20 patients were randomized to either control or treatment arm. At 4 weeks after cryotherapy, the treatment group demonstrated an average fold change in cancer antigen-related antibodies of 2.8% above their mean baseline values, whereas controls averaged an 18% change below mean baseline (p < 0.05). At 12 weeks, antibody response in treatment group increased to 25% above baseline, while the average of control group patients remained 9% below baseline (p < 0.05). Patients in treatment group displayed, on average, higher ELISPOT readings for the 4- and 12-week times points (527 vs 481 for PSA and 748 vs 562 for PAP). Conclusions: GMCSF appeared to broadly elevate antibodies against prostate-specific and nonspecific antigens.

Methods: From 2013 to 2016, 42 patients with a median age of 58 (range 42\u00e2\u20ac\u201c65) years with NDMM were enrolled in 15 centers. The primary endpoint was the complete response (CR) /stringent CR (sCR) rate after transplantation, and overall/progression-free survival rates were also evaluated. Results: Following induction therapy, the overall response rate was obtained in 71% of patients, including a CR/sCR of 10% and a very good partial response (VGPR) of 26%. Twenty-six of the 42 patients completed ASCT following the protocol and CR/sCR and VGPR rate 100 days after ASCT was 26% and 17%, respectively.

The depressive symptom hallmarks the progression of the neurodegenerative diseases, especially Alzheimer's disease. Bacterial infection is related to inflammation and depression. The present project thereby examined whether botanical drug puerarin could attenuate liposaccharide- (LPS-) induced depressive behaviors in mice. Methods. Adult male C57BL/6N mice were sequentially treated with LPS and puerarin and evaluated for the depressive behaviors by tail suspension test and forced swim test. The brain tissues were profiled for the molecular targets of puerarin by next-generation RNA sequencing technique. Candidate targets were further verified in LPS-treated mice, neural stem cells, and highly differentiated PC12 cell line. Results. Puerarin ameliorated LPS-induced depression in the mice. RNA sequencing profiles revealed that puerarin altered the expression of 16 genes while markedly downregulated Ras-related GTP-binding protein A (RagA) in LPS-treated mice. The effect of puerarin on RagA expression was confirmed by immunostaining, Western blot, and quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR). Biochemical studies showed that puerarin inhibited RagA/mTOR/p70S6K pathway, attenuated the accumulation of mTORC1 in close proximity to lysosome, and reduced the production of proinflammatory cytokines. Conclusions. Botanical drug puerarin attenuated inflammation and depressive behaviors in LPS-challenged mice by inhibiting RagA/mTOR/p70S6K pathways.

Purpose: To review the available evidence comparing the effectiveness of extraocular muscle botulinum toxin type A (BTXA) injection with eye muscle surgery for restoring ocular alignment in children and adults with nonparalytic, nonrestrictive horizontal strabismus. Methods: Literature searches in the PubMed Cochrane Library, and clinical trial databases with no date restrictions, but limited to articles published in English, were conducted last on January 10, 2021. The searches yielded 515 citations, 40 of which were reviewed in full text by the first author. Fourteen articles met the criteria for inclusion (randomized or nonrandomized comparative studies, or case series with a minimum 50 patients; evaluating extraocular muscle BTXA injection for initial or repeat treatment of horizontal, nonparalytic, nonrestrictive strabismus; with at least 6 months of follow-up) and were graded by a methodologist. Results: The 14 included studies consisted of 2 randomized clinical trials, 3 nonrandomized comparative studies, and 9 case series. All 5 comparative studies were graded level II evidence, and the 9 case series were graded level III evidence. Successful motor outcomes after BTXA injection were relatively consistent across 4 of the 5 comparative studies at 60%, when adjustment was made for differential selection bias in 1 of the studies. In the 4 studies, successful motor outcomes after surgery ranged from 66% to 77% with a mean follow-up of 23 to 75 months, and the outcomes were not significantly different from those after BTXA injection. In the fifth level II study, success was significantly higher with BTXA injection than with surgery (94% vs. 72%). The level III BTXA case series demonstrated higher motor success rates of 87% to 89% when children were treated in 2 muscles at a time; rates were lower in adults treated with single-muscle BTXA injection. Conclusions: Extraocular muscle injection of BTXA achieves a high rate of successful motor alignment, comparable with that achieved after eye muscle surgery for nonparalytic, nonrestrictive horizontal strabismus. Good alignment may require multiple BTXA injections, and it is not yet clear whether sensory outcomes are equivalent for BTXA injections versus eye muscle surgery in young children.",

Given that rods and cones also contribute to all these impacts of light, isolating mRGC visual and NIF roles in humans is challenging so that mRGC functions remains to be fully characterized. Here, we evaluated light-driven visual and cognitive brain responses in Leber's Hereditary Optic Neuropathy (LHON), an inherited optic neuropathy that is characterized by a selective relative sparing of the melanopsin-expressing retinal ganglion cells (mRGCs). Twelve patients and twelve matched healthy controls (HC) were enrolled in a functional brain magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) protocol including visual and visual-cognitive paradigms under blue (480 nm) and red (620 nm) light exposures. Primary visual cortex activation was detected in LHON patients; in particular higher occipital activation was found in response to sustained blue vs. red stimulation in LHON vs. HC. Similarly, brain responses to the executive task were larger under blue vs. red light in LHON over lateral prefrontal cortex.

Introduction: Seasonal influenza poses a major public health burden worldwide. Influenza vaccines, updated yearly to match circulating strains based on World Health Organization (WHO) recommendations, are the cornerstone of prevention and require regular monitoring. The COVID-19 pandemic is expected to cause logistical, site access and medical staff constraints and could affect the safety profile of influenza vaccines. Methods: Following European Medicines Agency guidance, an enhanced safety surveillance (ESS) study assessed the frequency and severity of predefined and other adverse events (AEs) occurring within 7\u00c2\u00a0days of receiving GSK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s inactivated quadrivalent seasonal influenza vaccine (IIV4), in Belgium, Germany and Spain in 2020/21, using adverse drug reaction (ADR) cards. Results: During the 2020/21 influenza season, 1054\u00c2\u00a0participants vaccinated with GSK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s IIV4 were enrolled (all adults in Belgium and Germany, 30% adults/70% children in Spain); 96 eligible children received a second dose. Overall, 1042 participants completed the study. After doses\u00c2\u00a01 and 2, 98.9% and 100% of participants, respectively, returned their completed ADR card. After doses\u00c2\u00a01 and 2, 37.8% (398/1054) and 13.5% (13/96) of participants, respectively, reported at least one AE.

A cardinal feature of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a long-lasting paradoxical alteration of memory with hypermnesia for salient traumatic cues and amnesia for peri-traumatic contextual cues. So far, pharmacological therapeutic approach of this stress-related disorder is poorly developed mainly because of the lack of animal model for this paradoxical memory alteration. Using a model that precisely recapitulates the two memory components of PTSD in mice, we tested if brexpiprazole, a new antipsychotic drug with pro-cognitive effects in rodents, may persistently prevent the expression of PTSD-like memory induced by injection of corticosterone immediately after fear conditioning. Acute administration of brexpiprazole (0.3 mg/kg) 7 days\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 post-trauma first blocks the expression of the maladaptive fear memory for a salient but irrelevant trauma-related cue. In addition, it enhances (with superior efficacy when compared to diazepam, prazosin, and escitalopram) memory for the traumatic context, correct predictor of the threat. This beneficial effect of brexpiprazole is overall maintained 1 week after treatment. In contrast brexpiprazole fully spares normal/adaptive cued fear memory, showing that the effect of this drug is specific to an abnormal/maladaptive (PTSD-like) fear memory of a salient cue. Finally, this treatment not only promotes the switch from PTSD-like to normal fear memory, but also normalizes most of the alterations in the hippocampal\u00e2\u20ac\u201camygdalar network activation associated with PTSD-like memory, as measured by C-Fos expression.

AH pathophysiology is classically attributed to an obstruction of the arachnoid granulations by blood. Recent findings in rodents suggest that after intraventricular hemorrhage, AH is related to cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) hypersecretion by the choroid plexus (CP), as it can be reduced by intracerebroventricular (ICV) injection of bumetanide. Objective: Here, we investigated if and how CSF hypersecretion and/or CSF outflow disorders contribute to post-SAH hydrocephalus. Methods: Ninety-four Wistar rats were used. SAH was induced by the endovascular perforation technique. The presence of AH was confirmed by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and rats with AH were randomly assigned to 4 groups: control group, superior sagittal sinus (SSS) thrombosis to block CSF reabsorption, ICV injection of saline, and ICV injection of bumetanide to decrease CSF secretion. Clinical outcome was evaluated with a neuroscore. A second MRI was performed 24\u00c2\u00a0h later to evaluate the ventricular volume. Results: Fifty percent of rats that survived SAH induction had AH. Their ventricular volume correlated well to the functional outcome after 24\u00c2\u00a0h (r = 0.803). In rats with AH, 24\u00c2\u00a0h later, ventricular volume remained equally increased in the absence of any further procedure. Similarly, ICV injection of saline or SSS thrombosis had no impact on the ventricular volume. However, ICV injection of bumetanide reduced AH by 35.9% (p = 0.002). Conclusion: In rodents, post-SAH hydrocephalus is may be due to hypersecretion of CSF by the CP, as it is limited by ICV injection of bumetanide.

Their total burn surface area (TBSA) varied from 10% to 30%; and the depth of burn injury ranged from second degree to third degree. The patients were randomized into two groups. In the control group, butorphanol combined with saline was injected into the body via venous route during dressing change. In the observation group, butorphanol in combination with dexmedetomidine was injected. The variation in mean blood pressure, heart rate, respiratory rate, and peripheral oxygen saturation were recorded at various time-points of the procedure. Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) of pain and Ramsay Sedation Scores (RSS) were also recorded at different time points. Consumption of butorphanol and adverse events in these two groups were compared. Results: The mean blood pressure and heart rate were significantly decreased in the observation group before butorphanol injection (P < 0.05) and before the dressing change (P < 0.05). The respiratory rates and peripheral oxygen saturation of these two groups showed no significant differences at all time points (P > 0.05). Patients in the observation group had lower VAS scores during dressing change (P < 0.05). The RSS Scores in the observation group were higher than those in the control group during (P < 0.05) and after the dressing change (P < 0.05). The consumption of butorphanol was more in the control group (P < 0.05), and the adverse events recorded in the control group were higher (P < 0.05). Conclusion: Butorphanol combined with dexmedetomidine can reduce analgesic use of butorphanol during dressing change. This combination resulted in a higher sedation score and fewer adverse effects.",

Introduction: There is a paucity of clinical data on C1q nephropathy (C1qN) in children in India and Southeast Asia. This is the first detailed analysis conducted to elucidate the prevalence, clinicopathological profile, and response to different immunosuppressives in children with C1qN in India. Materials and Methods: Detailed demographic profile, clinical features, urine and blood chemistries, kidney biopsy, and response to different immunosuppressives of the study participants were analyzed between August 2015 and October 2020 for steroid-dependent/-resistant nephrotic syndrome (NS). Results: C1qN was diagnosed in 16 (14.13%) of 113 children who underwent biopsy for steroid-dependent/-resistant NS. The mean age was 44 months (range 18-99 months) and male and female number was 12 (75%) and four (25%), respectively, and mean follow-up was 3.5 years. Eight (50%) had coexistent minimal-change nephrotic syndrome (MCNS) pattern, seven (43.7%) had focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS), and one (6.2%) had diffuse mesangial hypercellularity. Thirteen children had complete follow-up, of which eight (61.5%) and four (30.7%) cases presented as steroid-dependent and primary steroid-resistant NS, respectively, whereas one (7.6%) had joint pain with rashes. At presentation, seven (53.8%) had hypertension, 12 (92.3%) had nephrotic range proteinuria, and six cases (46.1%) had hematuria. Nine (75%) of 12 cases achieved complete remission with calcineurin inhibitor (CNI) therapy, and two were non responders, one was a partial responder, and one responded to mycophenolate. Of six FSGS cases, four had complete remission, one had partial remission, and one was in non-remission. Of six cases with MCNS, five had complete remission and one was in non-remission. Renal functions remained normal in all except one case who had progression to chronic kidney disease Stage 3. Conclusion: One out of seven children with difficult NS can have underlying C1qN. CNIs are most beneficial to attain and maintain remission. Renal functions remain normal in the majority. Along with C1q deposits, MCNS and FSGS patterns are seen equally and respond almost similarly to CNIs.\n",

In this study, we hypothesized that CD36 plays an important role in the immunopathogenesis of KD, by aiding in the clearance of plasma mitochondrial DNA, and by amplifying the immune response by activating the inflammasome pathway via AIM2. Fifty-two healthy controls, 52 febrile controls, and 102 KD patients were recruited for RT-PCR of target mRNA expression and plasma mitochondrial DNA. Blood samples were obtained 24 hours prior and 21 days after the administration of intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) therapy. Patients with acute KD had higher plasma levels of cell-free mitochondrial DNA (ND1, ND4, and COX1), and higher mRNA expressions of CD36 and AIM2 when compared to both healthy and febrile controls. A greater decrease in both CD36 and AIM2 mRNA expression after IVIG therapy was associated with the development of coronary artery lesions. Coronary artery lesions were associated with a larger decrease of CD36 expression following IVIG therapy, which may indicate that prolonged expression of the scavenger receptor may have a protective effect against the development of coronary artery lesions in KD.",

Background Programmed cell death protein-1 (PD-1) expression has been associated with activation and exhaustion of both the CD4 and CD8 populations in advanced non-small cell lung cancer (aNSCLC). Nevertheless, the impact of the balance between circulating CD8 + PD-1 + and CD4 + PD-1 + in patients treated with immune checkpoint blockers (ICB) is unknown. Methods The CD8 + PD-1 + to CD4 + PD-1 + ratio (PD-1-Expressing Ratio on Lymphocytes in a Systemic blood sample, or \u00e2\u201a\u00ac PERLS') was determined by cytometry in fresh whole blood from patients with aNSCLC before treatment with single-agent ICB targeting PD-1 or programmed cell death-ligand 1 (PD-L1 (discovery cohort). A PERLS cut-off was identified by log-rank maximization. Patients treated with ICB (validation cohort) or polychemotherapy (control cohort) were classified as PERLS+/- (above/below cut-off). Circulating immune cell phenotype and function were correlated with PERLS. A composite score (good, intermediate and poor) was determined using the combination of PERLS and senescent immune phenotype as previously described in aNSCLC. Results In the discovery cohort (N=75), the PERLS cut-off was 1.91, and 11% of patients were PERLS+. PERLS + correlated significantly with median progression-free survival (PFS) of 9.63 months (95% CI 7.82 to not reached (NR)) versus 2.69 months (95% CI 1.81 to 5.52; p=0.03). In an independent validation cohort (N=36), median PFS was NR (95% CI 7.9 to NR) versus 2.00 months (95% CI 1.3 to 4.5; p=0.04) for PERLS + and PERLS-, respectively; overall survival (OS) followed a similar but non-significant trend. In the pooled cohort (N=111), PERLS + correlated significantly with PFS and OS. PERLS did not correlate with outcome in the polychemotherapy cohort. PERLS did not correlate with clinical characteristics but was significantly associated with baseline circulating na\u00c3\u00afve CD4 + T cells and the increase of memory T cells post-ICB treatment. Accumulation of memory T cells during treatment was linked to CD4 + T cell polyfunctionality. The composite score was evaluated in the pooled cohort (N=68).

            "premise": "CNS endothelial derived extracellular vesicles are biomarkers of active disease in multiple sclerosis. Background: Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a complex, heterogenous disease characterized by inflammation, demyelination, and blood\u00e2\u20ac\u201cbrain barrier (BBB) permeability. Currently, active disease is determined by physician confirmed relapse or detection of contrast enhancing lesions via MRI indicative of BBB permeability. However, clinical confirmation of active disease can be cumbersome. As such, disease monitoring in MS could benefit from identification of an easily accessible biomarker of active disease. We believe extracellular vesicles (EV) isolated from plasma are excellent candidates to fulfill this need. Because of the critical role BBB permeability plays in MS pathogenesis and identification of active disease, we sought to identify EV originating from central nervous system (CNS) endothelial as biomarkers of active MS. Because endothelial cells secrete more EV when stimulated or injured, we hypothesized that circulating concentrations of CNS endothelial derived EV will be increased in MS patients with active disease. Methods: To test this, we developed a novel method to identify EV originating from CNS endothelial cells isolated from patient plasma using flow cytometry. Endothelial derived EV were identified by the absence of lymphocyte or platelet markers CD3 and CD41, respectively, and positive expression of pan-endothelial markers CD31, CD105, or CD144. To determine if endothelial derived EV originated from CNS endothelial cells, EV expressing CD31, CD105, or CD144 were evaluated for expression of the myelin and lymphocyte protein MAL, a protein specifically expressed by CNS endothelial cells compared to endothelial cells of peripheral organs. Results: Quality control experiments indicate that EV detected using our flow cytometry method are 0.2 to 1 micron in size. Flow cytometry analysis of EV isolated from 20 healthy controls, 16 relapsing\u00e2\u20ac\u201cremitting MS (RRMS) patients with active disease not receiving disease modifying therapy, 14 RRMS patients with stable disease not receiving disease modifying therapy, 17 relapsing-RRMS patients with stable disease receiving natalizumab, and 14 RRMS patients with stable disease receiving ocrelizumab revealed a significant increase in the plasma concentration of CNS endothelial derived EV in patients with active disease compared to all other groups (p = 0.001). Conclusions: For the first time, we have identified a method to identify CNS endothelial derived EV in circulation from human blood samples. Results from our pilot study indicate that increased levels of CNS endothelial derived EV may be a biomarker of BBB permeability and active disease in MS.",

Background: During the COVID-19 pandemic, telemedicine use has increased within community pediatrics. This trend runs counter to reluctance to adaptation of the new mode of healthcare that existed prior to the pandemic. Little is known about what we can expect after the pandemic: if physicians will opt for telemedicine modalities and if tele-pediatrics will continue to be a significant mode of community pediatric care. Objective: The goal of this study was to survey primary pediatric care providers as to their experiences and clinical decision making with telemedicine modalities prior to and during the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as their projected use after the pandemic ends. Material and methods: Using the EAPRASnet database we surveyed pediatricians throughout Europe, using a web-based questionnaire. The survey was performed during the COVID-19 pandemic (June\u00e2\u20ac\u201cJuly 2020), assessed telemedicine use for several modalities, prior to and during the pandemic as well as predicted use after the pandemic will have resolved. Participants were also surveyed regarding clinical decision making in two hypothetical clinical scenarios managed by telemedicine. Results: A total of 710 physicians participated, 76% were pediatricians. The percentage of respondents who reported daily use for at least 50% of all encounters via telemedicine modalities increased during the pandemic: phone calls (4% prior to the pandemic to 52% during the pandemic), emails (2\u00e2\u20ac\u201c9%), text messages (1\u00e2\u20ac\u201c6%), social media (3\u00e2\u20ac\u201c11%), cell-phone pictures/video (1\u00e2\u20ac\u201c9%), and video conferencing (1\u00e2\u20ac\u201c7%) (p < 0.005).

Methods: The BOP COVID-19 vaccination plan and implementation timeline are described. Descriptive statistics and vaccination coverage were calculated for the BOP incarcerated population using data from the BOP electronic medical record. Coverage among staff was calculated using data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Vaccination Administration Management System. Vaccination coverage in the BOP versus the overall United States adult population was compared by state/territory. Univariate and multivariable logistic regression models were developed to identify demographic, health-related, and institution-level factors associated with vaccination acceptance among incarcerated people, using hierarchical linear modeling to account for institution-level clustering. Results: By April 14, 2021, BOP had offered COVID-19 vaccination to 37,870 (100%) staff and 88,173/126,413 (69.8%) incarcerated people, with acceptance rates of 50.2% and 64.2%, respectively. At the time of analysis, vaccination coverage in BOP was comparable to coverage in the overall adult population in the states and territories where BOP institutions and offices are located. Among incarcerated people, factors associated with lower vaccination acceptance included younger age, female sex, non-Hispanic Black and Asian race/ethnicity, and having few underlying medical conditions; factors associated with higher acceptance included having a prior SARS-CoV-2 infection, being born outside the United States, and being assigned to a Federal Detention Center. Conclusions: Early COVID-19 vaccination efforts in BOP have achieved levels of coverage similar to the general population.

Methods: A national cross-sectional, pilot-validated, self-administered survey was conducted among HCWs in the KSA between December 27, 2020 and January 3, 2021. The survey included sociodemographic details, previous contact with COVID-19 patients, previous infection with COVID-19, receiving (or registering with the Ministry of Health website to receive) the COVID-19 vaccine, sources of HCWs\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 information on vaccines, awareness of emerging variants of concern, and anxiety level using the 7-item Generalized Anxiety Disorder assessment. A descriptive bivariate analysis and multivariate logistic binary regression analysis were performed. The primary evaluated outcome was vaccine uptake. Results: Of the 1058 participants who completed the survey, 704 (66.5%) were female, and 626 (59.2%) were nurses. Of all the respondents, 352 (33.27%) were enrolled to receive or had already received the vaccine, while 706 (66.73%) had not enrolled. In a bivariate analysis, not enrolling for vaccination was more likely in females than males (78.5% vs. 21.5%, P < 0.001), HCWs between the ages of 20 and 40 years than those >40 years (70.4% vs. 29.6%, P = 0.005), Saudi HCWs than expatriates (78% vs 22%, P < 0.001), and among HCWs who used social media as a source of information than those who did not (69.8% vs. 38.6%, P < 0.001).

Most patients had elevated C-reactive protein (92.3%), elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate (82.9%), and lymphocytopenia (74.2%) on admission. Lower lobes of the lung were most commonly involved, and ground-glass opacity (81.8%) was the most frequent finding in computed tomography scans. The administration of hydroxychloroquine improved the clinical outcome of the patients. Lopinavir/ritonavir was efficacious at younger ages. Of the 70 discharged patients, 40% had symptom aggravation, 8.6% were readmitted to the hospital, and three patients (4.3%) died. Conclusion: This report demonstrates a heterogeneous nature of clinical manifestations in patients affected with COVID19. The most common presenting symptoms are nonspecific, so attention should be made on broader testing, especially in age groups with the greatest risk and younger individuals who can serve as carriers of the disease. Hydroxychloroquine and lopinavir/ritonavir (in younger age group) can be potential treatment options. Finally, patients discharged from the hospital should be followed up because of potential symptom aggravation.",

In this article, a retrospective analysis of the medical histories was carried out in order to develop an individualized approach to treating COVID-19. Questions were raised about the advisability of the universal immunosuppressive therapy, the need to prescribe glucocorticosteroids only taking into account the cytokine profile of patients, the relationship of glucocorticosteroid therapy and carbohydrate metabolism disorders, as one of the most common complications of pharmacotherapy COVID-19 in the patients we studied. Unjustified immunosuppression in the stage of active fight against the infectious agent as a factor of chronization of the process and decrease of the body reactivity, as well as neutralization by immunosuppressive therapy of factors of protection of innate non-specific immunity mobilized to fight the causative agent. The importance of taking into account the probability of thrombosis with consideration of coagulogram indices and thrombosis markers (D-dimer, fibrin degradation products) does not exclude the risk of the hemorrhagic complications when prescribing high doses of anticoagulants. Antibacterial therapy for uncomplicated viral infections is neither an etiologic nor a pathogenetic treatment option. In addition, it leads to the emergence of resistant strains of microorganisms as a result of mutational variability and evolutionary adaptations of bacteria, which greatly complicates the choice of an effective antibacterial drug in some cases. Antithrombotic, glucocorticosteroid and antibacterial therapy should be clinically and laboratory justified in each individual case. The article focuses on the safety of prescribing antipodagric agents in the treatment of COVID-19 as anti-inflammatory. The review considers all the above-mentioned aspects of COVID-19 therapy with reference to foreign studies, describes options for the pathophysiological development of infection.

A survey of Australian and New Zealand clinicians: A paediatric research in emergency departments international collaborative (PREDICT) study.

Methods: This survey assessed change in factors influencing clinicians' (nurses and doctors) bronchiolitis management at baseline and post-intervention in a cluster randomised controlled trial of targeted, theory-informed interventions aiming to de-implement non-evidence-based bronchiolitis management (no use of chest X-ray, salbutamol, antibiotics, glucocorticoids and adrenaline). Survey questions addressed previously identified factors influencing bronchiolitis management from six Theoretical Domains Framework domains (knowledge; skills; beliefs about consequences; social/professional role and identity; environmental context and resources; social influences). Data analysis was descriptive. Results: A total of 1958 surveys (baseline = 996; post-intervention = 962) were completed by clinicians from the emergency department and paediatric inpatient units from 26 hospitals (intervention = 13; control = 13).

Like typical site VTE, SVT is also frequently associated with cancer, particularly intra-abdominal solid malignancies and myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs). The clinical presentation of SVT is nonspecific. Symptoms may be related to the underlying malignancy, and thrombosis is incidentally diagnosed by imaging studies for cancer staging or follow-up in a substantial proportion of cases. The occurrence of SVT predicts worse prognosis in patients with liver or pancreatic cancer and, not uncommonly, SVT may precede the diagnosis of cancer. Therefore, the occurrence of an apparently unprovoked SVT should prompt careful patient evaluation for the presence of an underlying malignancy or MPN. Cancer patients carry a high risk of VTE extension and recurrence and long-term anticoagulant treatment is suggested in the absence of high risk of bleeding. Either LMWH or direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) are suggested for the treatment of patients with cancer-related SVT, although limited experience is available on the use of DOACs in these settings.

Objective: We encountered a case of high-grade serous carcinoma (HGSC) of the ovary which recurred as carcinosarcoma of the sigmoid colon. Tumor cells of both the primary carcinoma and the secondary carcinosarcoma were negative for estrogen receptor (ER), WT-1, and PAX8. It is well known that most ovarian carcinomas arising from the M\u00c3\u00bcllerian duct are immunoreactive for these biologic parameters. To our knowledge, this is the first case report that provides the results of immunohistochemical analysis of WT-1 and PAX8 for a primary carcinoma and recurrent carcinosarcoma. Case report: A 61-year-old woman had an advanced right ovarian HGSC. After a primary debulking surgery (hysterectomy, bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy and omentectomy) and adjuvant chemotherapy, complete remission was achieved. However, four and a half years later, a tumor arising beside the sigmoid colon was detected. A tumorectomy was performed through combined partial resection of the ileum and sigmoid colon. Microscopically, the tumor was diagnosed as carcinosarcoma of the sigmoid colon, which had originated from HGSC of the ovary. Interestingly, the malignant cells of the primary carcinoma and epithelial components of the recurrent carcinosarcoma were negative for ER, WT-1, and PAX8. These immunohistochemical features were unusual. Three cycles of chemotherapy with the previously used regimen and three additional cycles of doxorubicin and ifosfamide combination chemotherapy were administered. Currently, 3 years after the final chemotherapy was administered, the patient remains healthy. Conclusion: HGSC of the ovary can recur as carcinosarcoma.

Computational modeling studies of interactions between azilsartan and PPAR-\u00ce\u00b3 revealed azilsartan as an agonist of PPAR-\u00ce\u00b3 and showed the mechanism of azilsartan in cardioprotection. Our study compared the cardioprotective potential of telmisartan to that of azilsartan in a murine model of myocardial ischemia-reperfusion injury\u00c2\u00a0by comparing their antioxidant, ant apoptotic, anti-inflammatory, mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)-modulating ability, and PPAR-\u00ce\u00b3 agonistic activity.

Purpose: Biologic agent-induced cardiotoxicity is markedly concerning. Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) treated with biologic agents is known to have the potential for cardiotoxicity; however, existing clinical evidence is not adequate to explain real-world patterns of cardiotoxicity. In this study, we quantify the risk of cardiotoxicity in patients with rheumatoid arthritis treated with biological agents. Methods: Cardiotoxicity reports induced by four types of biologic agents, abatacept, adalimumab, tocilizumab, and etanercept were used to mine data from the FDA's adverse event reporting system (FAERS) database from January 1, 2004 through September 30, 2020. Reports of cardiotoxic events were analyzed using a reporting odds ratio (ROR) algorithm, the proportional reporting ratio (PRR), the Bayesian confidence propagation neural network (BCPNN), the multi-item gamma Poisson shrinker (MGPS), and logistic regression methods. We use the preferred term of the Medical Dictionary of Regulatory Activities to identify such events. Results: A total of 3,969 reports of cardiotoxic events were identified involving biologic agents used for RA as the suspect drugs in this study, 317 reports of abatacept, 2,137 reports of adalimumab, 273 reports of tocilizumab, and 1,242 reports of etanercept.

Background: Angiosarcomas are a broad category of vascular origin neoplasms that are poorly characterized in veterinary species. Lymphangiosarcoma (LAS) is an uncommon type of angiosarcoma reported in humans and canines arising from lymphatic endothelium. LAS can be differentiated from other angiosarcomas in dogs based on expression of Prospero-related homeobox gene-1 (PROX-1) or lymphatic vessel endothelial receptor-1 (LYVE-1). Composite hemangioendothelioma (CHE) is a rare angiosarcoma subtype described in people and characterized by a variable biologic behavior and infrequent metastasis. This variant of angiosarcoma histologically combines features of retiform hemangioendothelioma and epithelioid hemangioendothelioma. Information regarding the cytologic and histopathologic appearance and clinical course of dogs with vascular tumors that exhibit features of CHE are unknown. Here, we report a case of pleomorphic LAS with features of CHE arising in a dog and treated with surgery and adjuvant chemotherapy. Case presentation: A 10-year-old intact male Labrador retriever presented with an approximately 6-cm-diameter cutaneous mass caudal to the left elbow that was progressively growing over 1.5 years. On physical examination, palpable extensions were identified coursing proximally over the triceps with concurrent loco-regional peripheral lymphadenopathy. Fine needle aspirates (FNA) and cytologic assessment of the cutaneous mass, left prescapular, and accessory axillary lymph nodes reported that this appeared to be a metastatic epithelial neoplasm, although a mixed carcinoma or collision tumor could not be excluded. An incisional biopsy of the mass was submitted for histopathology and was consistent with a well-differentiated angiosarcoma with features of CHE. The neoplasm expressed vimentin, CD31, von Willebrand factor (vWf), and PROX-1, supporting the diagnosis of LAS. Complete staging was performed, and no additional metastatic lesions were identified. Left forelimb amputation and lymph node removal were performed. Based on the diagnosis of metastatic LAS, doxorubicin chemotherapy was administered. 7 months post-amputation, the tumor recurred at the amputation site without evidence of metastatic disease. Conclusion: This report describes a malignant, locally aggressive lymphatic origin vascular tumor in a dog, with features consistent with descriptions of CHE in humans. Cytologic features in this case were discordant with its true mesenchymal etiology, obfuscating diagnosis. The morphologic features of the mesenchymal neoplastic population and immunohistochemistry (IHC) labeling ultimately supported a diagnosis of pleomorphic LAS with features of CHE.",

Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients who develop hematological relapse (HR) after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) generally have dismal clinical outcomes. Measurable residual disease (MRD)-directed preemptive interventions are effective approaches to prevent disease progression and improve prognosis for molecular relapsed patients with warning signs of impending HR. In this situation, boosting the graft-vs-leukemia (GVL) effect with immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) might be a promising prevention strategy, despite the potential for causing severe graft-vs-host disease (GVHD). In the present study, we reported for the first time an AML patient with RUNX1-RUNX1T1 who underwent preemptive treatment with the combined application of tislelizumab (an anti-PD-1 antibody) and azacitidine to avoid HR following allo-HSCT. On day +81, molecular relapse with MRD depicted by RUNX1-RUN1T1-positivity as well as mixed donor chimerism occurred in the patient. On day +95, with no signs of GVHD and an excellent eastern cooperative oncology group performance status (ECOG PS), the patient thus was administered with 100 mg of tislelizumab on day 1 and 100 mg of azacitidine on days 1-7. After the combination therapy, complete remission was successfully achieved with significant improvement in hematologic response, and the MRD marker RUNX1-RUNX1T1 turned negative, along with a complete donor chimerism in bone marrow. Meanwhile, the patient experienced moderate GVHD and immune-related adverse events (irAEs), successively involving the lung, liver, lower digestive tract and urinary system, which were well controlled by immunosuppressive therapies. As far as we know, this case is the first one to report the use of tislelizumab in combination with azacitidine to prevent post-transplant relapse in AML. In summary, the application of ICIs in MRD positive patients might be an attractive strategy for immune modulation in the future to reduce the incidence of HR in the post-transplant setting, but safer clinical application schedules need to be explored.",

Purpose: To report abnormal full-field electroretinograms (ERGs) in a patient with cystoid macular edema (CME) induced by systemic paclitaxel. Methods: This is an observational case report. Full-field ERGs were recorded to evaluate the retinal function using the RETeval system and conventional ERGs using contact lens electrodes with built-in white light-emitting diodes. Optical coherence tomography (OCT) was also used to assess the retinal morphology. Results: A 70-year-old man, who was diagnosed with gastric cancer, had undergone gastrectomy.

After the tenth course of paclitaxel, he experienced blurred vision in both eyes and visited our department of ophthalmology. OCT revealed the presence of CME in both eyes, and the RETeval flicker ERGs showed a marked reduction in the amplitudes and a prolongation of the implicit times in both eyes. Conventional ERGs showed that the amplitudes of the oscillatory potentials (OPs) were also severely attenuated.

Introduction: Palliative care aims to improve the quality of life of patients with a life-limiting or life-threatening illness and is multifaceted involving comprehensive interdisciplinary assessments and interventions. Interdisciplinary palliative care in the setting of untreatable cancer diagnoses is of particular importance due to additional considerations that must be taken as patients are often undergoing palliative chemotherapy and/or radiation therapy. These patients' complexity warrants special considerations and attentiveness to drug-related problems. Case report: The purpose of this case report is to highlight the importance of both complete and comprehensive medication histories in cancer care and the impact of proton pump inhibitors on pancreatic enzyme insufficiencies secondary to pancreatic cancers. This case involves a drug-related problem involving three medications that are commonly used in pancreatic cancer patients: pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy, a proton pump inhibitor, and a fluoroquinolone antibiotic. The patient presented in this case report is an 80-year-old man diagnosed with unresectable pancreatic cancer with a history of symptomatic gastroesophageal reflux disease managed with a proton pump inhibitor, specifically tablets of the 40 mg strength of pantoprazole magnesium taken orally once daily. During the patient's first of five 28-day cycles of palliative-intent chemotherapy with gemcitabine and nab-paclitaxel, the patient presented to the emergency department due to fever and, although not severely neutropenic, was prescribed amoxicillin/clavulanate and ciprofloxacin due to his advanced age. After reading a patient advisory on a ciprofloxacin patient information sheet that advised avoidance of concomitant administration of ciprofloxacin and magnesium, the patient self-discontinued his pantoprazole as it was a magnesium salt formulation. This discontinuation was followed by two weeks of persistent foul-smelling diarrhea, flatulence, and abdominal pain. Management and outcome: The patient's healthcare team symptomatically managed the patient with oral and intravenous rehydration unaware of the cause of the symptoms. A trial of pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy was initiated; however, it was unsuccessful in resolving his symptoms. After further investigation and a more in-depth patient interview, it was discovered that the discontinued proton pump inhibitor was likely the cause of the patient's new symptoms and was subsequently re-initiated. Pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy in combination with re-initiation of pantoprazole therapy essentially resolved all symptoms. Discussion: Before his diagnosis of unresectable pancreatic cancer, the patient had been on proton pump inhibitor therapy for nearly a decade. He had significant atrophy of the pancreas and an undoubtedly decreased pancreatic enzyme and bicarbonate production; however, he did not experience foul-smelling diarrhea indicative of pancreatic enzyme insufficiency while he was on his proton pump inhibitor. We believe that with his proton pump inhibitor therapy, he was unknowingly being partially treated for his worsening pancreatic enzyme insufficiency, specifically the component related to his lack of bicarbonate production and secretion. His discontinuation of his proton pump inhibitor led to a decrease in gastric acid, small bowel, and normal intraduodenal pH, which resulted in any remaining pancreatic enzyme reserve to become non-functional, unmasking his pancreatic enzyme insufficiency. An initial empiric trial of pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy failed in the absence of a proton pump inhibitor; however, within days of restarting his proton pump inhibitor along with pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy, his gastrointestinal symptoms completely resolved. This is due to the decrease of gastric and intraduodenal acidity, which better enabled the function of pancreatic enzymes present in pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy.",

Cathelicidin-WA (CWA) is a novel cathelicidin peptide isolated from snakes that has been suggested to exert anti-inflammatory effects. The aim of our study was to investigate whether cathelicidin-WA (CWA) could protect the heart from diabetic cardiomyopathy (DCM). Streptozotocin (STZ) injection was used to establish a mouse model of DCM. CWA peptide (2 mg/kg or 8 mg/kg) was continuously administered to the mice from 10\u00c2\u00a0weeks to 16\u00c2\u00a0weeks after STZ injection. The mice in the DCM group exhibited cardiac dysfunction, while 8 mg/kg CWA ameliorated this cardiac dysfunction. Cardiac fibrosis, inflammation, and oxidative stress as well as cardiomyocyte apoptosis in the DCM mice were decreased by treatment with 8 mg/kg CWA. We isolated neonatal rat cardiomyocytes and stimulated the cells with high glucose to establish an in vitro model of myocyte cell injury. Consistently, CWA inhibited high glucose-induced cell death, inflammation and oxidative stress in the myocytes. Moreover, CWA reduced the formation of the NLR family pyrin domain-containing 3 (NRLP3) inflammasome by regulating thioredoxin-interacting protein expression and p65 activation. NLRP3 overexpression inhibited the beneficial effects of CWA on the heart during DCM and on high glucose-induced myocyte injury.

However, CF-LVAD pump speed was strongly inversely associated with CVR in HM II (r2 = 0.51, p = .003) but not HM3 patients (r2 = 0.01, p = .65). Conclusions: Compared with HMII, HM3 patients have a significantly improved CVR. However, CVR remains lower in HM3 and HF patients than in healthy controls, therefore suggesting that changes in cerebral hemodynamics are not reversed by CF-LVAD therapy. Further research on the mechanisms and the long-term impact of altered cerebral hemodynamics in this unique patient population are warranted.",

            "premise": "Cesium treatment depresses glycolysis pathway in HeLa cell. Background/Aims: Cesium (Cs) is an alkali metal element that is of no essential use for humans; it has no known beneficial function that is verified by clinical research. When used as an alternative cancer therapy, it even causes toxicity in high doses. Thus, before using Cs as treatment in clinical settings, it is important to clearly determine its biological effects on cells. However, Cs was found to suppress the proliferation of human cervical cancer cells in a dose-dependent manner, and it was assumed that Cs inhibits the glycolysis pathway. In this study, we clearly determined the step of the glycolysis pathway that is affected by Cs. Methods: The glycolytic enzyme expressions, activities, and metabolite concentrations in HeLa cells were measured by PCR, western blotting, and enzymatic methods, after treating the cells with Cs for 3 days. Results: Cs treatment decreased transcriptional and expression levels of hexokinase, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, pyruvate kinase (PK), and lactate dehydrogenase and the activity of PK. Analysis of glycolysis pathway metabolites revealed that Cs treatment reduces lactate level and increases the level of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (oxidized form, NAD+); however, it did not affect the levels of pyruvate and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (reduced form, NADH). Increase of the [NAD+]/[NADH] ratio and decrease of the [lactate]/[pyruvate] ratio indicate that Cs treatment inhibits the aerobic glycolysis pathway. Conclusion: Cs treatment inhibits PK activity and increases the [NAD+]/[NADH] ratio. Hence, Cs has been determined to inhibit glycolysis, especially the aerobic glycolysis pathway. These results suggest that suppression of HeLa cell proliferation following Cs treatment was caused by inhibition of aerobic glycolysis by Cs.",

Objectives: To study the effect of ultrashort wave combined with loxoprofen sodium on serum inflammatory factors in patients with acute gouty arthritis. Methods: Records of patients with acute gouty arthritis who were treated in The Fourth Hospital of Changsha from May 2018 to September 2020, were reviewed. Of them, 77 cases were selected and divided into two groups based on the received treatment. The control group (n=39) was treated with loxoprofen sodium, and the treatment group (n=38) was treated with an ultrashort wave combined with loxoprofen sodium, for 10 continuous days. The clinical efficacy of the treatment in two groups was analyzed. Results: After treatment, the quality of life of patients in both groups was improved (P < 0.05), but there was no significant difference in the degree of improvement between the two groups (P >0.05). After treatment, the VAS score of the treatment group was lower than that of the control group (P < 0.05), the improvement of symptoms and signs of the treatment group was better than that of the control group (P < 0.05). Serum CRP and ESR levels in the treatment group were lower than those in the control group (P < 0.05), and the serum IL-1 \u00ce\u00b2, IL-8, TNF-a and MMP-3 levels of the treatment group were lower than those of the control group (P < 0.05).

Objective: Squamous cell carcinomas (SCCs) with shared etiology, histological characteristics, and certain risk factors represent the most common solid cancers. This study reports the crosstalk between autophagy and ferroptosis at the molecular level in SCCs, and their roles on the immunological tumor microenvironment (TME) of SCCs. Methods: In this study, the connections between autophagy and ferroptosis were characterized in SCCs by analyzing the associations between autophagy- and ferroptosis-related genes in mRNA expression and prognosis, protein-protein interactions and shared signaling pathways. Autophagy potential index (API) and ferroptosis potential index (FPI) of each tumor were quantified for reflecting autophagy and ferroptosis levels via principal-component analysis algorithm. Their synergistical roles on TME, immunity, drug resistance and survival were systematically analyzed in SCCs. Results: There were close connections between autophagy and ferroptosis at the mRNA and protein levels and prognosis. Both shared cancer-related pathways. The API and FPI were separately developed based on prognostic autophagy- and ferroptosis-related genes. A high correlation between API and FPI was found in SCCs. Their interplay was distinctly associated with favorable prognosis, enhanced sensitivity to chemotherapy drugs (Sunitinib, Gefitinib, Vinblastine and Vorinostat), an inflamed TME and higher likelihood of response to immunotherapy in SCCs.

Objectives: To review the effectiveness and safety of chemical ablation using ethanol or OK-432 for the treatment of TGDCs (thyroglossal duct cysts). Methods: MEDLINE and EMBASE databases were searched up to May 29, 2020, to identify studies reporting the safety and efficacy of chemical ablation using ethanol or OK-432 for the treatment of TGDCs. The search query consisted of synonyms of thyroglossal duct cysts and ethanol or OK-432 ablation. The pooled success and complication rates were calculated using the inverse variance method to calculate weights, and pooled proportions were determined using the DerSimonian-Laird random-effects method. Results: Seven original articles including a total of 129 patients were included.

Vitamin D deficiency, persistent hyperparathyroidism, and bone loss are common after kidney transplantation (KTx). However, limited evidence exists regarding the effects of cholecalciferol supplementation on parathyroid hormone (PTH) and bone loss after KTx. In this prespecified secondary endpoint analysis of a randomized controlled trial, we evaluated changes in PTH, bone metabolic markers, and bone mineral density (BMD). At 1 month post-transplant, we randomized 193 patients to an 11-month intervention with cholecalciferol (4000 IU/d) or placebo. The median baseline 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25[OH]D) level was 10 ng/mL and 44% of participants had osteopenia or osteoporosis. At the end of the study, the median 25(OH)D level was increased to 40 ng/mL in the cholecalciferol group and substantially unchanged in the placebo group. Compared with placebo, cholecalciferol significantly reduced whole PTH concentrations (between-group difference of \u00e2\u02c6\u201915%; 95% confidence interval [CI] \u00e2\u02c6\u201925 to \u00e2\u02c6\u20193), with greater treatment effects in subgroups with lower 25(OH)D, lower serum calcium, or higher estimated glomerular filtration rate (pint < 0.05).

Purpose: Atherosclerosis and its related clinical complications are the leading cause of death. MicroRNA (miR)-92a in the inflammatory endothelial dysfunction leads to atherosclerosis. Kr\u00c3\u00bcppel-like factor 2 (KLF2) is required for vascular integrity and endothelial function maintenance. Flavonoids possess many biological properties. This study investigated the vascular protective effects of chrysin in balloon-injured carotid arteries. Materials and methods: Exosomes were extracted from human coronary artery endothelial cell (HCAEC) culture media. Herb flavonoids and chrysin were the treatments in these atheroprotective models. Western blotting and real-time PCRs were performed. In situ hybridization, immunohistochemistry, and immunofluorescence analyses were employed. Results: MiR-92a increased after balloon injury and was present in HCAEC culture media. Chrysin was treated, and significantly attenuated the miR-92a levels after balloon injury, and similar results were obtained in HCAEC cultures in vitro. Balloon injury-induced miR-92a expression, and attenuated KLF2 expression. Chrysin increased the KLF2 but reduced exosomal miR-92a secretion. The addition of chrysin and antagomir-92a, neointimal formation was reduced by 44.8 and 49.0% compared with balloon injury after 14\u00c2\u00a0days, respectively. Conclusion: Chrysin upregulated KLF2 expression in atheroprotection and attenuated endothelial cell-derived miR-92a-containing exosomes.

Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the most common primary liver cancer and one of the leading causes of cancer-related death. Cilostazol, an antiplatelet drug, elicits anticancer effects on human squamous cell carcinoma and colon cancer cells. We previously reported that cilostazol protects normal mature hepatocytes from alcohol-induced apoptotic cell death. In addition, cilostazol stimulates liver regeneration after hepatectomy. Therefore, this study evaluated whether cilostazol elicits pro- or anti-proliferative effects on HCC using Hep3B and SK-Hep1 cells. Cilostazol inhibited proliferation of HCC cells by inducing apoptosis. Additionally, cilostazol induced G0/G1 cell cycle arrest and decreased expression of cyclin D1 and proliferating cell nuclear antigen. Activation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and inhibition of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) and AKT signaling were associated with the anti-proliferative effect of cilostazol. LY294002 and PD98059, inhibitors of AKT and ERK, respectively, enhanced the anti-proliferative effect of cilostazol. By contrast, inhibition of AMPK using compound C or AMPK-targeting siRNA abolished the anti-proliferative effect of cilostazol. Moreover, AMPK inhibition reversed the down-regulation of AKT/EKR induced by cilostazol, indicating negative cross-talk between AMPK and AKT/ERK. These findings provide evidence that cilostazol exerts anti-tumor activity in HCC by counter-regulating AMPK and AKT/ERK signaling. Taken together, our findings suggest that cilostazol may provide clinical benefits in HCC patients by selectively targeting HCC cells without interfering with liver function.",

Methods: Thirty patients with recurrent GBM and 10 patients with recurrent WHO grade II\u00e2\u20ac\u201cIII glioma were treated with bevacizumab-based salvage therapy at the Medical University of Vienna. Prior to each treatment cycle, EDTA plasma was drawn and sPD-L1 was measured applying a sandwich ELISA with a lower detection limit of 0.050 ng/ml. Leukocyte counts and C-reactive protein (CRP) levels were measured according to institutional practice. Results: Median number of sPD-L1 measurements was 6 per patient (range: 2\u00e2\u20ac\u201c24). At baseline, no significant difference in sPD-L1 concentrations was observed between WHO grade II\u00e2\u20ac\u201cIII glioma and GBM.

Postpericardiotomy syndrome (PCTS) is one of the most frequent cardiac surgery complications seen in 9-65% of patients. Despite its widespread occurrence, the mechanisms of the development of PCTS are still understudied. drug. The use of colchicine in cardiac surgery patients is of particular interest. Due to the ability of this drug the colchicine mechanisms of action are able to inhibit the mobilization of the NLRP3 inflammasome assembly, to suppress the activation of caspase-1. As a result, it can prevent the release of proinflammatory cytokines, namely IL-1\u00ce\u00b2 and IL-18. There are conflicting data on the effect of colchicine on the PCTS progression within the systemic inflammatory response after cardiac surgery. In this regard, it was important to study the dynamics of serum levels of IL-6, IL-10, IL-1\u00ce\u00b2, and TNF\u00ce\u00b1 in patients before coronary artery bypass grafting (T1), 6 hours (T2), and 10 days (T3) after surgery, and to evaluate the effect of colchicine on the development of PCTS. The results of our research showed a significant increase of IL-10 in both groups 6 hours after surgery. However, on the 10th day, the increase in the level of IL-10, compared with the initial values, was higher in the 1st group \u00e2\u20ac\u201c 2 times, compared with the 2nd group. In both groups, showed significant increase in serum concentration of IL-6 after 6 h surgery, with a subsequent decrease in the expression at the stage of T3, while the IL-6 levels in the 2nd group was statistically notably higher than T1. The incidence of pleurisy was lower in the group of patients taking colchicine. Only in the 1st group IL-6 levels were directly associated with IL-10. In patients with pleurisy, the level of released IL-10 and TNF\u00ce\u00b1 was significantly higher in the 2nd group. There were no significant intergroup differences in serum levels of IL-1\u00ce\u00b2 and TNF\u00ce\u00b1, as well as significant changes in IL-1\u00ce\u00b2 between the stages of observation. Analysis of TNF\u00ce\u00b1 expression revealed significant differences in TNF\u00ce\u00b1 content in the 1st group between the T1-T3 and T2-T3 stages. In both groups, multiple positive associations were found between the studied indicators. Thus, data were obtained indicating the anti-inflammatory effect of colchicine in cardiac surgery patients. This was clinically expressed in a tendency to a lower incidence of pleurisy, and was accompanied by increased expression of IL-10, which has an anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory effect against the background of the drug in the postoperative period.",

Purpose: To investigate the role of circulating rare cells (CRCs), namely, circulating tumor cells (CTCs) and circulating endothelial cells (CECs), in aiding early intervention, treatment decision, and prognostication in bladder cancer. Methods: A total of 196 patients with pathologically confirmed bladder cancer, namely, 141 non-muscle invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC) and 55 muscle invasive bladder cancer (MIBC) patients. There were 32 patients who received cisplatin-based neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) followed by radical cystectomy (RC). Subtraction enrichment combined with immunostaining-fluorescence in situ hybridization (SE-iFISH) strategy was used for CTC/CEC detection. Kaplan\u00e2\u20ac\u201cMeier analysis and Cox regression were used to evaluate the overall survival (OS) and recurrence-free survival (RFS). Receiver operator characteristic analysis was used to discriminate NAC sensitivity. Results: CTCs and CECs were related to clinicopathological characteristics. Triploid CTCs, tetraploid CTCs, and total CECs were found to be higher in incipient patients than in relapse patients (P = 0.036, P = 0.019, and P = 0.025, respectively). The number of total CECs and large cell CECs was also associated with advanced tumor stage (P = 0.028 and P = 0.033) and grade (P = 0.028 and P = 0.041). Remarkably, tumor-biomarker-positive CTCs were associated with worse OS and RFS (P = 0.026 and P = 0.038) in NMIBC patients underwent TURBT. CECs cluster was an independent predictor of recurrence in non-high-risk NMIBC patients underwent TURBT (HR = 9.21, P = 0.040). For NAC analysis, pre-NAC tetraploid CTCs and small cell CTCs demonstrated the capability in discriminating NAC-sensitive from insensitive patients. Additionally, tetraploid CTCs and single CTCs elevated post-NAC would indicate chemoresistance. Conclusion: CTCs and CECs may putatively guide in diagnosis, prognosis prediction, and therapeutic decision-making for bladder cancer.",

Aims: Estimate the clinical and economic benefits of lenzilumab plus standard of care (SOC) compared with SOC alone in the treatment of patients hospitalized with COVID-19 pneumonia from the United States (US) hospital perspective. Materials and methods: A per-patient cost calculator was developed to report the clinical and economic benefits associated with adding lenzilumab to SOC in newly hospitalized COVID-19 patients over 28 days. Clinical inputs were based on the LIVE-AIR trial, including failure to achieve survival without ventilation (SWOV), mortality, time to recovery, intensive care unit (ICU) admission, and invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV) use. Base case costs included the anticipated list price of lenzilumab, drug administration, and hospital resource costs based on the level of care required. A scenario analysis examined projected one-year rehospitalization costs. Results: In the base case and all scenarios, lenzilumab plus SOC improved all specified clinical outcomes relative to SOC alone. Lenzilumab plus SOC resulted in estimated cost savings of $3,190 per patient in a population aged <85 years with C-reactive protein (CRP) levels <150 mg/L and receiving remdesivir (base case).

In this preliminary report, we aim to describe the epidemiology, clinical characteristics, and outcomes of adult critically ill COVID-19 patients, requiring invasive mechanical ventilation (iMV), and receiving IL-6RA and steroids therapy over the last 11\u00c2\u00a0months. Materials and methods: International, multicenter, cohort study derived from Viral Infection and Respiratory Illness University Study registry and conducted through Discovery Network, Society of Critical Care Medicine. Data were collected between March 01, 2020, and January 10, 2021. Results: Of 860 patients who met eligibility criteria, 589 received steroids, 170 IL-6RAs, and 101 combinations. Patients who received IL-6RAs were younger (median age of 57.5\u00c2\u00a0years vs. 61.1 and 61.8\u00c2\u00a0years in the steroids and combination groups, respectively). The median C-reactive protein level was > 75\u00c2\u00a0mg/L, indicating a hyperinflammatory phenotype. The median daily steroid dose was 7.5\u00c2\u00a0mg dexamethasone or equivalent (interquartile range: 6\u00e2\u20ac\u201c14\u00c2\u00a0mg); 80.8% and 19.2% received low-dose and high-dose steroids, respectively. Of the patients who received IL-6RAs, the majority received one dose of tocilizumab and sarilumab (dose range of 600\u00e2\u20ac\u201c800\u00c2\u00a0mg for tocilizumab and 200\u00e2\u20ac\u201c400\u00c2\u00a0mg for sarilumab). Regarding the timing of administration, we observed that steroid and IL-6RA administration on day 0 of ICU admission was only 55.6% and 39.5%, respectively. By day 28, when compared with steroid use alone, IL-6RA use was associated with an adjusted incidence rate ratio (aIRR) of 1.12 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.88, 1.4) for ventilator-free days, while combination therapy was associated with an aIRR of 0.83 (95% CI 0.6, 1.14). IL-6RA use was associated with an adjusted odds ratio (aOR) of 0.68 (95% CI 0.44, 1.07) for the 28-day mortality rate, while combination therapy was associated with an aOR of 1.07 (95% CI 0.67, 1.70). Liver dysfunction was higher in IL-6RA group (p = 0.04), while the bacteremia rate did not differ among groups. Conclusions: Discordance was observed between the registry utilization patterns (i.e., timing of steroids and IL-6RA administration) and new evidence from the recent randomized controlled trials and guideline recommendations. These data will help us to identify areas of improvement in prescribing patterns and enhance our understanding of IL-6RA safety with different steroid regimens.

Canine inflammatory mammary cancer (IMC) is highly malignant, invasive and a therapeutic challenge, because effective medical treatment is still unavailable. This retrospective study compares the efficacy of an oral cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) inhibitor combined with toceranib phosphate and oral cyclophosphamide (multi-drug therapy [MT]) with COX-2 inhibitor therapy alone (single-drug therapy [ST]) in dogs diagnosed with secondary IMC. Clinical response, adverse events, overall survival time (OST), disease-free survival (DFS) and time to progression (TTP) were evaluated. Sixteen patients were included, eight received MT and eight receiving ST. Median OST was significantly higher in patients receiving MT (96.0 vs. 37.5 days; p\u00c2\u00a0=.046) and in patients with post-surgical rather than non-surgical IMC (86.5 vs. 41.5 days; p\u00c2\u00a0=.038). Additionally, median TTP was significantly higher in patients treated with MT (p\u00c2\u00a0=.010). In patients with non-surgical IMC, the clinical benefit (CB) was reached in 100% (n\u00c2\u00a0= 3) of patients receiving MT and in 33% (n\u00c2\u00a0= 1) of those receiving ST; the response duration was significantly longer in MT cases (p\u00c2\u00a0=.026).

Background: Standard dosage regimens of quinine formulated for adult patients with uncomplicated and complicated malaria have been applied for clinical uses in children, pregnant women, and elderly. Since these populations have anatomical and physiological differences from adults, dosage regimens formulated for adults may not be appropriate. The study aimed to (i) review existing information on the pharmacokinetics of quinine in children, pregnant women, and elderly populations, (ii) identify factors that influence quinine pharmacokinetics, and (iii) analyse the relationship between the pharmacokinetics and treatment outcomes (therapeutic and safety) of various dosage regimens of quinine. Methods: Web of Sciences, Cochrane Library, Scopus, and PubMed were the databases applied in this systematic search for relevant research articles published up to October 2020 using the predefined search terms. The retrieved articles were initially screened by titles and abstracts to exclude any irrelevant articles and were further evaluated based on full-texts, applying the predefined eligibility criteria.

Methods and findings We evaluated 1139 children \u00e2\u2030\u00a45 years old hospitalised with clinical pneumonia: 101 HIV-exposed, uninfected (HEU) and 1038 HIV-unexposed, uninfected (HUU). Median age was 11 months (IQR 6-20), 59% were male, median mid-upper arm circumference (MUAC) was 14 cm (IQR 13-15) and mean weight-for-height z score was -0.7 (\u00c2\u00b12.5). The highest Respiratory Index of Severity in Children (RISC) scores were allocated to 10.4% of the overall cohort. Only 45.7% had fever, and 37.2% had at least one danger sign at presentation. The most common clinical features were crackles (54.7%), nasal flaring (53.5%) and lower chest wall indrawing (53.2%). Compared with HUU, HEU children were significantly younger (9 months vs 11 months), with lower mean birth weight (2.8 kg vs 3.0 kg) and MUAC (13.6 cm vs 14.0 cm), had higher prevalence of vomiting (32.7% vs 22.0%), tachypnoea (68.4% vs 49.8%) and highest RISC scores (20.0% vs 9.4%). Five children died (0.4%). However, clinical outcomes were similar for both groups. Conclusions In this post-PCV setting where prevalence of HIV and malnutrition is high, children hospitalised fulfilling the WHO Integrated Management of Childhood Illness criteria for clinical pneumonia present with heterogeneous features. These vary by HIV exposure status but this does not influence either the frequency of danger signs or mortality. The poor performance of available severity scores in this population and the absence of more specific diagnostics hinder appropriate antimicrobial stewardship and the rational application of other interventions.",

Understanding the pathology of COVID-19 is a global research priority. Early evidence suggests that the respiratory microbiome may be playing a role in disease progression, yet current studies report contradictory results. Here, we examine potential confounders in COVID-19 respiratory microbiome studies by analyzing the upper (n = 58) and lower (n = 35) respiratory tract microbiome in well-phenotyped COVID-19 patients and controls combining microbiome sequencing, viral load determination, and immunoprofiling. We find that time in the intensive care unit and type of oxygen support, as well as associated treatments such as antibiotic usage, explain the most variation within the upper respiratory tract microbiome, while SARS-CoV-2 viral load has a reduced impact. Specifically, mechanical ventilation is linked to altered community structure and significant shifts in oral taxa previously associated with COVID-19. Single-cell transcriptomics of the lower respiratory tract of COVID-19 patients identifies specific oral bacteria in physical association with proinflammatory immune cells, which show higher levels of inflammatory markers. Overall, our findings suggest confounders are driving contradictory results in current COVID-19 microbiome studies and careful attention needs to be paid to ICU stay and type of oxygen support, as bacteria favored in these conditions may contribute to the inflammatory phenotypes observed in severe COVID-19 patients.",

Malaria vaccine candidates based on live, attenuated sporozoites have led to high levels of protection. However, their efficacy critically depends on the sporozoites' ability to reach and infect the host liver. Administration via mosquito inoculation is by far the most potent method for inducing immunity but highly impractical. Here, we observed that intradermal syringe-injected Plasmodium berghei sporozoites (syrSPZ) were 3-fold less efficient in migrating to and infecting mouse liver than mosquito-inoculated sporozoites (msqSPZ). This was related to a clustered dermal distribution (2-fold-decreased median distance between syrSPZ and msqSPZ) and, more importantly, a 1.4-fold (significantly)-slower and more erratic movement pattern. These erratic movement patterns were likely caused by alteration of dermal tissue morphology (.15-mm intercellular gaps) due to injection of fluid and may critically decrease sporozoite infectivity. These results suggest that novel microvolume-based administration technologies hold promise for replicating the success of mosquito-inoculated live, attenuated sporozoite vaccines. IMPORTANCE Malaria still causes a major burden on global health and the economy. The efficacy of live, attenuated malaria sporozoites as vaccine candidates critically depends on their ability to migrate to and infect the host liver. This work sheds light on the effect of different administration routes on sporozoite migration. We show that the delivery of sporozoites via mosquito inoculation is more efficient than syringe injection; however, this route of administration is highly impractical for vaccine purposes. Using confocal microscopy and automated imaging software, we demonstrate that syringe-injected sporozoites do cluster, move more slowly, and display more erratic movement due to alterations in tissue morphology. These findings indicate that microneedle-based engineering solutions hold promise for replicating the success of mosquito-inoculated live, attenuated sporozoite vaccines.",

Introduction: Acquired resistance to TKI is an important unmet need in the management of EGFR mutated lung cancer. Recent clinical trial IMPower150 suggested that combination approach with VEGF inhibitor, check point inhibitor immunotherapy and platinum-based chemotherapy was effective in oncogene driven lung cancer. The current trial examined the efficacy of a modified regimen in an EGFR mutated cohort. Methods: An open-labelled, single arm, phase II study was conducted in patients with EGFR mutated NSCLC who had progressed on at least one EGFR TKI. For those with T790M mutation, radiological progression on osimertinib was required for enrolment. Patients were treated with combination atezolizumab (1200 mg), bevacizumab (7.5 mg/kg), pemetrexed (500 mg/m2) and carboplatin (AUC 5) given once every 3 weeks until progression. Results: Forty patients were enrolled. Median age was 62 (range 45\u00e2\u20ac\u201c76) years. More than one half (23/40, 57.5%) had progressed on osimertinib. PD-L1 expression was < 1% in 52.5%. Median follow-up time was 17.8 months. ORR was 62.5%. Median PFS was 9.4 months (95% CI: 7.6 \u00e2\u20ac\u201c 12.1). One year OS was 72.5% (95% CI: 0.56\u00e2\u20ac\u201c0.83). Treatment related grade 3 or above adverse events (AE) occurred in 37.5% (15/40). Immune-related AE occurred in 32.5% (13/40) patients.

To strategically design and frame the novel 9-Br-Trimethoxybenzyl noscapine (BTN) with rigorous binding affinity with tubulin, the structure of noscapine (an antitussive plant alkaloid) was amended with a 3,4,5-trimethoxybenzyl group linked at the seventh position on the lower isobenzofuran unit. Molecular modelling and cellular studies were used to assess the single and combined effects of BTN and docetaxel (DOX). Based on MM-GBSA, the individual calculated free energies of binding (\u00ce\u201dGbind, pred) for BTN and DOX with tubulin was found to be \u00e2\u02c6\u201925.69 and \u00e2\u02c6\u201938.17 kcal/mol, respectively, and \u00e2\u02c6\u201929.11 and \u00e2\u02c6\u201936.60 kcal/mol based on MM-PBSA.

Approaches targeting pGlu3-A\u00ce\u00b2 by glutaminyl cyclase (QC) inhibition (Varoglutamstat) or monoclonal antibodies (Donanemab) are currently in clinical development. Here, we aimed at an assessment of combination therapy of Varoglutamstat (PQ912) and a pGlu3-A\u00ce\u00b2-specific antibody (m6) in transgenic mice. Whereas the single treatments at subtherapeutic doses show moderate (16\u00e2\u20ac\u201c41%) but statistically insignificant reduction of A\u00ce\u00b242 and pGlu-A\u00ce\u00b242 in mice brain, the combination of both treatments resulted in significant reductions of A\u00ce\u00b2 by 45\u00e2\u20ac\u201c65%. Evaluation of these data using the Bliss inde-pendence model revealed a combination index of \u00e2\u2030\u02c61, which is indicative for an additive effect of the compounds. The data are interpreted in terms of different pathways, in which the two drugs act.

Background & Aims: Pharmacologic agents targeting bile acid signaling show promise for treating nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). However, clinical findings suggest that new treatment strategies with enhanced therapeutic efficacy and minimized undesired effects are needed. This preclinical study investigates whether combining an apical sodium-bile acid transporter (ASBT) inhibitor GSK233072 (GSK672) and fibroblast growth factor-15 (FGF15) signaling activation improves anti-NASH efficacy. Methods: Mice with high fat, cholesterol, and fructose (HFCFr) diet-induced NASH and stage 2 fibrosis are used as a NASH model. GSK672 or AAV8-TBG-FGF15 interventions are administered alone or in combination to HFCFr diet-fed mice. Results: The combined treatment significantly enhances therapeutic efficacy against steatosis, inflammation, ballooning, and fibrosis than either single treatment. Mechanistically, the synergistic actions of GSK672 and FGF15 on inhibiting gut bile acid reuptake and hepatic bile acid synthesis achieve greater magnitude of bile acid pool reduction that not only decreases bile acid burden in NASH livers but also limits intestinal lipid absorption, which, together with FGF15 signaling activation, produces weight loss, reduction of adipose inflammation, and attenuated hepatocellular organelle stress. Furthermore, the combined treatment attenuates increased fecal bile acid excretion and repressed bile acid synthesis, which underlie diarrhea and hypercholesterolemia associated with ASBT inhibition and FGF19 analogue, respectively, in clinical settings. Conclusions: Concomitant ASBT inhibition and FGF15 signaling activation produce metabolic changes that partially mimic the bariatric surgery condition whereby lipid malabsorption and increased FGF15/19 signaling synergistically mediate weight loss and metabolic improvement. Further clinical studies may be warranted to investigate whether combining ASBT inhibitor and FGF19 analogue enhances anti-NASH efficacy and reduced treatment-associated adverse events in humans.",

MAPK/extracellular signal\u00e2\u20ac\u201cregulated kinase kinase (MEK) 1/2 inhibitors (MEKis) have recently achieved surprising success in treating unresectable plexiform neurofibromas (PNFs). However, few studies have investigated the mechanisms of MEKi resistance in patients with PNF. We determined the efficacy of six different MEKis for treating PNFs, explored drug resistance mechanisms, and identified potential combination therapies to overcome resistance. By screening drug efficacy among six MEKis in human NF1-deficient PNF cell lines, TAK-733 was found to reduce PNF cell viability the most. We then cultured the TAK-733\u00e2\u20ac\u2019resistant cells and explored the potential targets for further treatment. Both high-throughput drug screening and RNA sequencing analyses of MEKi-resistant PNF cells identified cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors as potential agents for PNFs. Dinaciclib, a cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor, showed synergistic effects on MEKi-resistant cells. Coadministration of dinaciclib and TAK-733 significantly reduced cell viability and inhibited sphere formation and colony formation.

To counteract immune escape, we investigated the therapeutic activity of a combined tumor vaccine-immune-checkpoint inhibitor therapy using \u00ce\u00b1-PD-L1. Design: In this trial, Mlh1-knock-out mice with established gastrointestinal tumors received single or thrice injections of \u00ce\u00b1-PD-L1 monoclonal antibody clone 6E11 (2.5\u00c2\u00a0mg/kg bw, q2w, i.v.) either alone or in combination with the vaccine.

Results: 6E11 monotherapy slightly increased median overall survival (mOS: 6.0\u00c2\u00a0weeks vs. control 4.0\u00c2\u00a0weeks). Increasing the number of injections (n = 3) improved therapy outcome (mOS: 9.2\u00c2\u00a0weeks) and was significantly boosted by combining 6E11 with the vaccine (mOS: 19.4\u00c2\u00a0weeks vs. 10.2\u00c2\u00a0weeks vaccine monotherapy). Accompanying PET/CT imaging confirmed treatment-induced tumor growth control, with the strongest inhibition in the combination group. Three mice (30%) achieved a complete remission and showed long-term survival. Decreased levels of circulating splenic and intratumoral myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSC) and decreased numbers of immune-checkpoint-expressing splenic T cells (LAG-3, CTLA-4) accompanied therapeutic effects. Gene expression and protein analysis of residual tumors revealed downregulation of PI3K/Akt/Wnt-and TGF-signaling, leading to T cell infiltration, reduced numbers of macrophages, neutrophils and MDSC.

Treatment options for patients with pancreatic cancer are limited and survival prospects have barely changed over the past 4 decades. Chemoradiation treatment (CRT) has been used as neoadjuvant therapy in patients with borderline resectable disease to reduce tumour burden and increase the proportion of patients eligible for surgery. Antimetabolite drugs such as gemcitabine and 5-fluorouracil are known to sensitise pancreatic tumours to radiation treatment. Likewise, photodynamic therapy (PDT) has also been shown to enhance the effect of radiation therapy. However, PDT is limited to treating superficial lesions due to the attenuation of light by tissue. The ability of the related technique, sonodynamic therapy (SDT), to enhance CRT was investigated in two murine models of pancreatic cancer (PSN-1 and BxPC-3) in this study. SDT uses low intensity ultrasound to activate an otherwise non-toxic sensitiser, generating toxic levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) locally. It is applicable to greater target depths than PDT due to the ability of ultrasound to propagate further than light in tissue. Both CRT and the combination of CRT plus SDT delayed tumour growth in the two tumour models. In the PSN-1 model, but not the BxPC-3 model, the combination treatment caused an increase in survival relative to CRT alone (p = 0.038). The improvement in survival conferred by the addition of SDT in this model may be related to differences in tumour architecture between the two models.

This poor vascularisation may explain why PSN-1 tumours were more susceptible to the effects of vascular damage exerted by SDT treatment.",

We aimed to compare the profiles of chronic rhinitis patients obtained during the autumn pollen season in Baotou (grassland city) and Beijing (non-grassland city), China. Methods: Questionnaire surveys and allergen testing were conducted on 1170 and 1232 patients with chronic rhinitis visiting the Second Affiliated Hospital of Baotou Medical College and Beijing Tongren Hospital, respectively, during the autumn pollen period. Information regarding medical history, severity of symptoms, and diagnosis and treatment was collected. Results: More patients with moderate to severe chronic rhinitis and asthma (both, P < 0.001) were present in Baotou than in Beijing. Mugwort was the most abundant allergen in both regions, but the number of patients sensitized to outdoor allergens in Baotou was higher than that in Beijing (P < 0.001).

Background: One of the most important causes of preterm birth (PTB) is cervical insufficiency, which usually it's treated by performing a surgical cervical cerclage (CC). Currently, a valid alternative to surgical treatment is represented by the application of a non-invasive intravaginal silicon device called Arabin\u00c2\u00ae pessary (AP). The aim of the study is to compare these two therapeutic approaches in terms of gestational and neonatal outcomes. Methods: In this observational cohort study, we retrospectively evaluated the pregnant women between 18 and 24 gestational weeks referred to the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology of San Giovanni Calibita Fatebenefratelli Hospital of Rome from 2015 to 2017 with the diagnosis of threatened preterm birth. The 26 women were divided into groups according to the treatment received: cervical cerclage (Group-1, inpatient) and Arabin\u00c2\u00ae pessary (Group-2, out-patient), both in combination with vaginal progesterone (PG). The primary outcome was the gestational age at delivery, and various secondary maternal and neonatal outcomes were considered. Results: The results do not show a statistically significant difference between the two groups, both in terms of gestational and neonatal outcomes. Considering surgical risks (anesthesia, blood loss), recovery-time and economic costs of CC, AP showed very interesting advantages resulting in more favorable cost-benefits relation. Conclusion: We confirmed once again that out-patient combination of AP and vaginal PG is a safe, noninvasive choice as treatment of PTB. Unfortunately, the small population doesn't allow to define this a noninferiority trial. Further larger randomized controlled studies are needed to reassure clinicians about the efficacy of this combined non-invasive approach.",

Objectives: Second-line immune checkpoint inhibition (ICI) was recently shown to have a survival advantage over placebo in malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM), but the survival comparison to chemotherapy in patients with MPM receiving routine clinical care is unknown. Our objective was to examine the effectiveness of second-line ICI versus chemotherapy on overall survival (OS) outcomes in real-world patients with advanced MPM. Materials and Methods: We performed a multicenter retrospective cohort study of real-world adult patients with advanced MPM who received first-line platinum-based chemotherapy and at least two total lines of systemic therapy. Patients received either second-line chemotherapy (gemcitabine and/or vinorelbine) or ICI therapy (pembrolizumab or nivolumab \u00c2\u00b1 ipilimumab). The primary outcome was OS, defined as the time from second-line therapy initiation to death or end of the observation period. We used Kaplan-Meier methods and Cox proportional hazards modeling with adjustment for relevant patient demographic and clinical variables to compare OS between the two second-line treatment groups. Results: Of the 176 patients with MPM, the median age was 75 years (IQR: 69\u00e2\u20ac\u201c79.5 years), and most were white (77%), male (74%), and had epithelioid histology (67%). Thirty-five percent (61) received second-line chemotherapy and 65% (1 1 5) ICI therapy (80 pembrolizumab, 31 nivolumab, and 4 nivolumab + ipilimumab). Treatment with ICI was associated with significantly longer median OS compared to chemotherapy (8.7 vs 5.0 months, p=0.001; adjusted hazard ratio: 0.52, 95% CI: 0.34\u00e2\u20ac\u201c0.81). The estimated 12-month OS probability was 36.7% (95% CI: 27.6%-45.8%) and 15.6% (95% CI: 7.7%-26.1%) in the ICI and chemotherapy groups, respectively. Conclusion: In this \u00e2\u20ac\u0153real-world\u00e2\u20ac\u009d population of patients with MPM, treatment with ICI was associated with improved OS outcomes compared to chemotherapy in the second-line setting, in contrast with a recent clinical trial.

Background: Various anatomical and physiological factors make intubation in infants challenging. C-MAC videolaryngoscope shows better results as compared to the conventional direct laryngoscopy for intubation in infants. McGrath MAC size-1 with a disposable Macintosh type blade has recently been introduced for use in infants and has not been formally evaluated in this population. Aims: This study aims to evaluate the intubation characteristics of C-MAC Miller and McGrath MAC in neonates and infants with the primary objective to compare the time with the two devices. Methods: After informed consent from the parents, 140 neonates and infants scheduled for surgical procedures were randomized to undergo intubation with either C-MAC Miller or McGrath MAC after standard general anesthesia. The two devices were compared in terms of total intubation time, Percent of Glottic Opening score, Cormack Lehane grades, time to glottis view, intubation difficulty score, overall success rate, first attempt success rate, and complications. Results: The median glottic view time (6\u00c2\u00a0s [4\u00e2\u20ac\u201c9] vs. 6\u00c2\u00a0s [4\u00e2\u20ac\u201c9]; p\u00c2\u00a0=.40) and intubation time (27\u00c2\u00a0s [25.5\u00e2\u20ac\u201c28] vs. 27\u00c2\u00a0s [24.5\u00e2\u20ac\u201c29.5]; p\u00c2\u00a0=.87) were similar.

However, the Percent of Glottic Opening score, Cormack Lehane grades, and subjective intubation difficulty were significantly better with C-MAC. The first attempt success rates, overall success rates (100% vs. 97.5%), and intubation difficulty scores were comparable. There were two failed intubations with McGrath which were successfully intubated with C-MAC. Conclusion: The C-MAC Miller blade showed similar intubation timings, success rates, and intubation difficulty score as compared to McGrath MAC in neonates and infants, though the former provided superior glottic views.

Objective: Iron accumulation in the brain leads to the development of Alzheimer\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s and Parkinson\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s diseases. Nowadays, iron chelation therapy is the best way to decrease the side effects of iron and amyloid plaques accumulation. Iron chelators are commonly used for the treatment of Alzheimer\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s disease. Previous studies have shown that natural products such as phenol and flavonoid compounds could chelate heavy metals. In the current study, we examined the iron chelation activity of hesperidin and coumarin on the brain tissue of iron-overloaded mice. Methods: 48 NMRI male mice were divided into eight groups (n = 6). Six groups were treated with iron dextran (100 mg/kg/day) four times a week for 6 weeks. After stopping the injections for a month, five groups of iron-overloaded mice were treated with hesperidin, coumarin, and desferal four times a week subsequent for four subsequent weeks. Finally, the mice were anesthetized, and blood samples were collected from the ventricle of the heart for subsequent examination. The brain tissues were isolated and fixed in the 4% paraformaldehyde solution for Perl\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s staining. Results: The results show that hesperidin and coumarin could strongly chelate excessive iron from the serum and deposit iron from the brain tissue compared to desferal group. Catalase and super oxidase activity were decreased in the iron-overloaded group, but in the treated group by hesperidin and coumarin, the enzyme\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s activity was increased significantly.

Background: Patients with intermediate to advanced stage hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC; Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer [BCLC] stage B/C) have few choices of curable treatments and thus suffer from dismal outcomes. Although surgical resection could prolong survival in certain selected patients with BCLC stage B/C HCC, the frequent postoperative recurrence and poor survival of these patients need to be improved by combining other therapies perioperatively. Objective: This study was conducted to investigate the survival associations of adjuvant portal vein perfusion chemotherapy (PVC) and neoadjuvant hepatic arterial infusion chemotherapy (HAIC) in patients with resectable BCLC stage B/C HCC. Methods: A retrospective study was conducted in consecutive patients who underwent R0 resection for intermediate to advanced stage HCC, combined with either PVC or HAIC perioperatively between January 2017 and December 2018. Patients treated with PVC or HAIC were analyzed according to intention-to-treat (ITT) and per protocol (PP) principles, respectively. The chemotherapy regimen of adjuvant PVC and neoadjuvant HAIC included 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin/oxaliplatin. Survival analysis and Cox regression for overall survival (OS) and event-free survival (EFS) were used to compare the outcomes. Results: Among all 64 patients enrolled in this study, 28 received perioperative PVC and 36 received HAIC for ITT analysis. Age (median 44.00 vs. 46.50 years; p\u00c2\u00a0=\u00c2\u00a00.364), sex (male: 25/28 vs. 35/36; p\u00c2\u00a0=\u00c2\u00a00.435), and tumor size (median 9.55 vs. 8.10 cm; p\u00c2\u00a0=\u00c2\u00a00.178) were comparable between the two groups.

This study determined current real-world use of CPX-351 versus conventional 7+3 (cytarabine+daunorubicin) therapy and evaluated hospital length of stay (LOS) and supportive care utilization in t-AML and AML-MRC. Patients and Methods: This retrospective, observational study utilized the Premier Healthcare Database and included patients who were aged \u00e2\u2030\u00a518 years with t-AML or AMLMRC and treated with CPX-351 or 7+3 between August 1, 2017 and February 28, 2019. All patients treated with 7+3 were required to be eligible for CPX-351 based on its FDAapproved indication. Outcome variables were annualized and adjusted for patient, hospital, and clinical confounding factors. The primary outcome was inpatient LOS. Secondary outcomes included use of blood products and use of anti-infectives. Results: The study included 195 qualifying patients treated with CPX-351 and 160 patients treated with 7+3 who were eligible for CPX-351. Approximately one-third of the patients treated with CPX-351 were administered therapy in a hospital-based outpatient setting, and all patients treated with 7+3 received it in the inpatient setting. The regression-adjusted annualized inpatient LOS was shorter with CPX-351 than 7+3 (mean of 183.7 vs 197.1 days, p<0.001). The difference in meanadjusted LOS was most pronounced for t-AML, with a mean-adjusted LOS of 168.9 versus 192.5 days for CPX-351 versus 7+3, respectively (nominal p<0.001). Supportive care utilization, including the number of administrations of red blood cells, the number of administrations of platelets, and the number of days on anti-infectives, was similar between treatment groups. Conclusion: CPX-351 was associated with a shorter inpatient LOS than 7+3. Supportive care use, including blood products and anti-infectives, was similar for CPX-351 and 7+3.

Our study evaluated the incidence of acute graft versus host disease (GVHD) and survival among patients receiving CIVI vs. TDI CsA during their first allogeneic HCT. Methods: A retrospective study of adult patients undergoing first allogeneic HCT at the University of Minnesota Medical Center between 2011 and 2017.

Background: Pressure ulcers are a risk for bedridden patients and various supports exist to prevent them. The Pressure Relief Index (PRI) evaluates pressure relief of dynamic mattresses over time. This study compared the PRI of the SUMMIT mattress (AKS-France) and the NIMBUS 3 (HNE Medical). Methods: In this non-blinded, randomized, crossover, non-inferiority study, patients aged \u00e2\u2030\u00a560 with a BMI of 16\u00e2\u20ac\u201c35 kg/m2, predominantly confined to bed, able to walk with aid and with pelvic symmetry were recruited from a hospital rehabilitation department from March\u00e2\u20ac\u201cApril 2012. Exclusion criteria included past or present pressure ulcers, inability to remain supine and deep vein thrombosis. Peak pressures of the sacrum were recorded at 0.1 Hz during a single complete 10-min inflating cycle on both mattresses, with the order determined via electronic randomization allocation. Results: Thirty-one subjects were included and randomized; with 14 finally analyzed in the SUMMIT-NIBMUS 3 order group and 16 in the NIMBUS 3-SUMMIT group. The difference in PRI <30 mmHg between the two mattresses was 13.2% [0.3\u00e2\u20ac\u201c26.1] (p < 0.05), allowing a non-inferiority - superiority switch. The SUMMIT mattress demonstrated a significantly higher percentage of time <30 mmHg (p = 0.0454). No significant difference in mean minimal pressure was seen (p = 0.3231) and mean maximal pressure was in favor of SUMMIT mattress (p = 0.0096). BMI did not affect pressure profile. There were no adverse events. Conclusions: Evaluated by the PRI, the SUMMIT mattress had a better interface pressure profile than the NIMBUS 3 in older patients.

This study compared the anti-atherosclerotic activity of SeNPs stabilized with chitosan (CS-SeNPs) and Na2SeO3 and the related mechanism in a high-fat-diet-fed apolipoprotein E-deficient mouse model of atherosclerosis. The results showed that oral administration of both CS-SeNPs and Na2SeO3 (40 \u00ce\u00bcg Se/kg/day) for 10 weeks significantly reduced atherosclerotic lesions in mouse aortae. Mechanistically, CS-SeNPs and Na2SeO3 not only alleviated vascular endothelial dysfunction, as evidenced by the increase of serum nitric oxide level and the decrease of aortic adhesion molecule expression, but also vascular inflammation, as evidenced by the decrease of macrophage recruitment as well as the expression of proinflammatory molecules. Importantly, these results were replicated within in-vivo experiments on the cultured human endothelial cell line EA.hy926.

The IR analysis confirmed binding to the metal ion by the sulfur and ethoxy oxygen atoms in the carbimazole (CMZ) ligand, while in the 6-mercaptopurine (MP) ligand, the sulfur and the N7 nitrogen atom of a purine coordinated binding to the metal ion. The third ligand showed a 1:1 molar ratio and bound via sulfonamide oxygen and the nitrogen of the pyrimidine ring. Analysis of the synthesized complexes also showed that acetate groups had monodentate binding to the (UO22+).

Study Design In this retrospective cohort study, infants born at \u00e2\u2030\u00a432 weeks were divided into groups with a UVC tip in either a low-lying or good position. The primary outcome was UVCAI. Survival analysis represented time to infection between groups. Subgroup analyses were based on duration of UVC indwelling time.

Objective: Thoracic endovascular aortic repair (TEVAR) for ruptured thoracic aortic aneurysms is associated with increased perioperative mortality and morbidity compared with intact repair. The purpose of our study was to evaluate the factors associated with the presentation of ruptured aneurysms and adverse outcomes after repair. Methods: The Vascular Quality Initiative (VQI) registry was queried (2010-2020) to identify patients who had undergone TEVAR for ruptured and intact thoracic aortic aneurysms. The primary outcome was to identify the factors associated with ruptured thoracic aortic aneurysms. The secondary outcomes included perioperative mortality and morbidity, 5-year survival, and the identification of factors associated with adverse outcomes after TEVAR. Results: Of the 3039 patients identified with a thoracic aortic aneurysm, 2806 (92%) had undergone repair for an intact aneurysm and 233 (8%) had undergone repair for a ruptured aneurysm. Chronic kidney disease was associated with a greater odds of a presentation with a ruptured aneurysm (odds ratio [OR], 3.1; 95% confidence interval [CI], 2.0-4.9; P < .001). The factors associated with a lower odds of rupture included prior aortic aneurysm repair (OR, 0.71; 95% CI, 0.49-0.97; P = .05), prior smoker (OR, 0.36; 95% CI, 0.24-0.53; P < .001), preoperative beta-blocker therapy (OR, 0.57; 95% CI, 0.41-0.80; P = .001), and preoperative statin therapy (OR, 0.68; 95% CI, 0.49-0.94; P = .020). TEVAR for ruptured thoracic aortic aneurysms was associated with higher perioperative mortality (rupture vs intact, 27% vs 4.6%; OR, 6.6; 95% CI 4.3-10; P < .001) and the composite outcome of mortality, new dialysis, paralysis, and stroke (38% vs 9.5%; OR, 5.1; 95% CI, 3.5-7.4; P < .001). The 5-year survival was significantly lower after TEVAR for ruptured thoracic aortic aneurysms (50% vs 76%; P < .001; hazard ratio, 0.39; 95% CI, 0.29-0.52; P < .001). Preoperative statin therapy was associated with higher 5-year survival (hazard ratio, 1.3; 95% CI, 1.0-1.6; P = .021). Conclusions: TEVAR for ruptured thoracic aortic aneurysms results in increased perioperative mortality and morbidity and lower 5-year survival compared with TEVAR for intact aneurysms. Patients with prior aortic aneurysm repair, prior smoking, and preoperative beta-blocker or statin therapy were less likely to present with ruptured thoracic aneurysms.

Evidence regarding the comparison between peripherally inserted central catheters (PICC) or tunneled central catheters in Pulmonary Hypertension (PH) is scarce. We sought to study the incidence of mechanical and infectious complications associated with PICC and Hickman catheters in patients with PH under epoprostenol treatment. Methods: This is a single-center retrospective study of patients with PH who received continuous treatment with intravenous epoprostenol for at least 24 h between January 2010 and July 2020. Mechanical and infectious complications were analyzed according to the catheter type: PICC and Hickman. The incidence of catheter-related complications was calculated per 1000 exposure-days of risk.

Background: Congenital malaria, which is caused by vertical transmission of malaria parasites, is a potentially fatal condition. Despite Africa\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s high malaria burden, congenital malaria is not routinely screened for, and thus may go undiagnosed. Malaria, if not treated promptly, can quickly progress to severe forms and result in death. Severe congenital malaria is believed to be uncommon in neonates due to maternal antibodies, fetal haemoglobin, and the placenta\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s sieving effect. The majority of reported cases were classified as having severe anaemia. Following a thorough review of the literature, only one case of congenital cerebral malaria (CCM) has been reported, and it was misdiagnosed. Case presentation: A 5-day-old Nigerian neonate born to an apparently healthy mother initially displayed characteristics consistent with neonatal sepsis and severe neonatal hyperbilirubinaemia. He quickly developed characteristics consistent with meningitis. Surprisingly, the peripheral blood film revealed evidence of malaria parasites, which was immediately confirmed by Giemsa-stained thick and thin blood film microscopy for malaria. The patient was diagnosed with congenital cerebral malaria. The medication was modified to parenteral artesunate followed by oral artemisinin combination therapy. The neonate recovered fully and had no neurological deficits on follow up.

Objective. To explore the effect of continuous lumbar plexus block guided by the \"Shamrock method\"on postoperative analgesia and hemodynamics in elderly patients after total knee arthroplasty (TKA). Methods. From January 2020 to December 2020 in our hospital, 98 patients who underwent TKA were selected. Using the random number table method, the patients were divided into two groups: a continuous lumbar plexus block group (group L), with 49 patients, and a continuous femoral nerve block group (group F), with 49 patients. The onset time and maintenance time of motor and sensory nerve blocks in patients were recorded. A visual analogue scale (VAS) was applied to assess the pain severity at 6, 12, 24, and 48 h after the operation. The VAS score (FVAS) was applied to evaluate the pain severity of the patients during 24 and 48 h after the operation and knee joint functional exercise. The levels of hemodynamic indexes such as heart rate, mean arterial pressure, and oxyhemoglobin saturation and the levels of hemorheological indexes such as plasma viscosity, high and low whole blood shear viscosity, fibrinogen, and hematocrit were detected and compared between the two groups immediately after the operation and at 12 h and 48 h after the operation, respectively. The incidence of adverse reactions induced by anesthesia was counted. Results. The onset time of motor and sensory nerve blocks in group L was lower than that in group F, and the maintenance time was higher than that in group F (P<0.05). The VAS scores of 6, 12, 24, and 48 h after operation in group L were significantly lower than those in group F (P<0.05). The FVAS scores of group L at 24 and 48 h after operation were significantly lower than those of group F (P<0.05). The heart rates of the patients in the two groups were higher at 12 h and 48 h after operation than those immediately after operation (P<0.05). The heart rates at 12 h and 48 h after operation in group L were lower than those in group F (P<0.05). The plasma viscosity, high whole blood shear viscosity, and low whole blood shear viscosity in the group L at 12 h and 48 h after operation were lower than those in group F (P<0.05).

The aim of this study is to investigate the effect of i.v. lidocaine on perioperative propofol and sufentanil dose, pulse oxygen saturation, postoperative pain score, and recovery time during pediatric colonoscopy. Methods: We designed a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study and enrolled 40 children aged from 3 to 10 years who underwent colonoscopy. After titration of propofol to achieve unconsciousness, the patients were given i.v. lidocaine (1.5 mg/kg later 2 mg/kg / hour) or the same volume of saline. Sedation was standardized and combined propofol with sufentanil. The primary outcome variables were intraoperative propofol and sufentanil requirements, and the number of oxygen desaturation episodes. Secondary outcome variables were recovery time after colonoscopy and post-colonoscopy pain. Results: Lidocaine infusion resulted in a significant reduction in propofol requirements: (median (quartile) 1.8 (1.5-2.0) vs. 3.0 (2.8-3.3) mg/kg respectively; P < 0.001) and sufentanil requirements: (median (quartile) 0.06 (0.05-0.08) vs. 0.1 (0.1-0.1) \u00ce\u00bcg/kg respectively; P < 0.001).

We were interested in understanding whether the chelating activity of Oleuropein (Ole) was able to improve the copper accumulation and the related pro-oxidant and glycative damage in the liver of mice fed HFD.

Med., (2021), 8, (643402), 10.3389/fmed.2021.643402). Background: Glaucoma is an irreversible and blinding neurodegenerative disease that is characterized by progressive loss of retinal ganglion cells. The current animal models of glaucoma fail to provide a chronic elevated intraocular pressure and cannot maintain the optical media clarity for a long time, which brings some difficulties to the study of glaucoma. Here, we developed a new chronic ocular hypertension model of mice induced by cross-linking hydrogel intracameral injection. Methods: C57BL/6J mice aged 6\u00e2\u20ac\u201c8 weeks were randomly divided into the control group and the operation group. The mice of the operation group were injected with cross-linking hydrogel to induce ocular hypertension. Intraocular pressure was measured preoperatively, 3 days after surgery, and weekly until the end of the study. Flash visual evoked potential (F-VEP) was used to observe optic nerve function at different times (preoperatively and 2, 4, and 6 weeks) after chronic ocular hypertension (COH). Retinal TNF-\u00ce\u00b1, IL-1\u00ce\u00b2, and IL-17A protein expression were measured by western blotting in the control group and in mice at 2, 4, and 6 weeks after COH. Microglial cell activation was evaluated by immunofluorescence staining and western blotting. Apoptosis and loss of retinal ganglion cells after 2, 4, and 6 weeks of intracameral injection of cross-linking hydrogel were observed by the TUNEL assay and Brn3a protein labeling. The loss of optic nerve axons in COH mice was evaluated by neurofilament heavy polypeptide protein labeling. Results: Intracameral injection of the cross-linking hydrogel induces increased intraocular pressure (IOP) to a mean value of 19.3 \u00c2\u00b1 4.1 mmHg, which was sustained for at least 8 weeks. A significant difference in IOP was noted between COH mice and sham-operation mice (p < 0.0001). The success rate was 75%. The average amplitude of F-VEP in mice with COH was reduced (p = 0.0149, 0.0012, and 0.0009 at 2, 4, and 6 weeks after COH vs. the control group, respectively), and the average latent period in mice with COH was longer (p = 0.0290, <0.0001, and <0.0001 at 2, 4, and 6 weeks after COH vs. the control group, respectively) compared with that in the control group. TNF-\u00ce\u00b1, IL-1\u00ce\u00b2, IL-17A, Iba-1, and CD68 protein expression increased in COH mice. During the processing of COH, the number of microglial cells increased along with cellular morphological changes of rounder bodies and thicker processes compared with the control group. Apoptosis of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) was clearly observed in mice at 2, 4, and 6 weeks after COH (p = 0.0061, 0.0012, <0.0001, and 0.0371 at 2, 4, and 6 weeks after COH vs. the control group, respectively). The RGC density decreased significantly in the COH mice compared with the control group (p = 0.0042, 0.0036, and <0.0001 at 2, 4, and 6 weeks after COH vs. the control group, respectively). There was a significant loss of optic nerve axons in mice after intracameral injection of cross-linking hydrogel (p = 0.0095, 0.0002, and <0.0001 at 2, 4, and 6 weeks after COH vs. the control group, respectively). Conclusions: A single intracameral injection of cross-linking hydrogel can effectively induce chronic ocular hypertension in mice, which causes progressive loss of retinal ganglion cells, increased expression levels of inflammatory cytokines and microglial cell activation, and deterioration of optic nerve function.",

METHODS AND RESULTS: Studies were identified from MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane Controlled Trials Register, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, and the National Institutes of Health Clini calTr ials.gov database. The quality of included articles was rated using Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network 50. Outcomes examined were atrioventricular conduction, left ventricular function, ventricular arrhythmias, and mortality. A total of 3527 references were retrieved, and 34 publications met the inclusion criteria. There were no randomized trials, and only 2 studies were rated good quality. In the 34 reports (total of 1297 patients), 1125 patients received corticosteroids, 235 received additional or other immunosuppressant therapy, and 97 patients received no therapy. There were 178 patients treated for atrioventricular conduction disease, with 76/178 (42.7%) improving.

Importance: Lifelong immunoglobulin replacement therapy (IRT) is standard-of-care treatment for congenital agammaglobulinemia but accrues high annual costs ($30000-$90000 per year) and decrements to quality of life over patients' life spans. Hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) offers an alternative 1-time therapy, but has high morbidity and mortality. Objective: To evaluate the cost utility of IRT vs matched sibling donor (MSD) and matched unrelated donor (MUD) HSCT to treat patients with agammaglobulinemia in the US. Design, Setting, and Participants: This economic evaluation used Markov analysis to model the base-case scenario of a patient aged 12 months with congenital agammaglobulinemia receiving lifelong IRT vs MSD or MUD HSCT. Costs, probabilities, and quality-of-life measures were derived from the literature. Microsimulations estimated premature deaths for each strategy in a virtual cohort. One-way sensitivity and probabilistic sensitivity analyses evaluated uncertainty around parameter estimates performed from a societal perspective over a 100-year time horizon. The threshold for cost-effective care was set at $100000 per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY). This study was conducted from 2020 across a 100-year time horizon. Exposures: Immunoglobulin replacement therapy vs MSD or MUD HSCT for treatment of congenital agammaglobulinemia Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary outcomes were incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) expressed in 2020 US dollars per QALY gained and premature deaths associated with each strategy. Results: In this economic evaluation of patients with congenital agammaglobulinemia, lifelong IRT cost more than HSCT ($1512946 compared with $563776 [MSD] and $637036 [MUD]) and generated similar QALYs (20.61 vs 17.25 [MSD] and 17.18 [MUD]). Choosing IRT over MSD or MUD HSCT yielded ICERs of $282166 per QALY gained over MSD and $255633 per QALY gained over MUD HSCT, exceeding the US willingness-to-pay threshold of $100000/QALY. However, IRT prevented at least 2488 premature deaths per 10000 microsimulations compared with HSCT. When annual IRT price was reduced from $60145 to below $29469, IRT became the cost-effective strategy. Findings remained robust in sensitivity and probabilistic sensitivity analyses. Conclusions and Relevance: In the US, IRT is more expensive than HSCT for agammaglobulinemia treatment. The findings of this study suggest that IRT prevents more premature deaths but does not substantially increase quality of life relative to HSCT. Reducing US IRT cost by 51% to a value similar to IRT prices in countries implementing value-based pricing may render it the more cost-effective strategy..",

Background: There is significant over-prescription of antibiotics for suspected community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) patients as bacterial and viral pathogens are difficult to differentiate. To address this issue, a host response diagnostic called MeMed BV (MMBV) was developed that accurately differentiates bacterial from viral infection at the point of need by integrating measurements of multiple biomarkers. A literature-based cost-impact model was developed that compared the cost impact and clinical benefits between using the standard of care diagnostics combined with MMBV relative to standard of care diagnostics alone. Methods: The patient population was stratified according to the pneumonia severity index, and cost savings were considered from payer and provider perspectives. Four scenarios were considered. The main analysis considers the cost impact of differences in antibiotic stewardship and resulting adverse events. The first, second, and third scenarios combine the impacts on antibiotic stewardship with changes in hospital admission probability, length of hospital stay and diagnosis related group (DRG) reallocation, and hospital admission probability, length of stay, and DRG reallocation in combination, respectively. Results: The main analysis results show overall per-patient savings of $37 for payers and $223 for providers. Scenarios 1, 2, and 3 produced savings of $137, $189, and $293 for payers, and $339, $713, and $809 for providers, respectively. Limitations: Models are simulations of real-world clinical processes, and are not sensitive to variations in clinical practice driven by differences in physician practice styles, differences in facility-level practice patterns, and patient comorbidities expected to exacerbate the clinical impact of CAP. Hospital models are limited to costs and do not consider differences in revenue associated with each approach.

The improved toxicity profile of patients treated with TARE in the trial, however, could result in a quality of life benefit in economic evaluations. Our objective was to perform a cost-utility analysis of TARE versus sorafenib for locally advanced and inoperable hepatocellular carcinoma. Methods: This study used patient-level data of the SARAH trial regarding resource use, progression-free and overall survival, and quality of life for the within-trial period for the patients who received at least 1 dose of sorafenib or 1 treatment with TARE according to their randomization arm. Data were extrapolated by using a partitioned survival model that incorporated costs and health outcomes, measured in life-years and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs).

Introduction: Results from the CASPIAN trial (Durvalumab \u00c2\u00b1 Tremelimumab in Combination With Platinum Based Chemotherapy in Untreated Extensive-Stage Small Cell Lung Cancer) trial demonstrated the clinical benefit of durvalumab plus etoposide\u00e2\u20ac\u201cplatinum (EP) chemotherapy as first-line treatment for patients with extensive stage small-cell lung cancer (ES-SCLC). However, considering the high price of durvalumab, it is unclear whether addition of durvalumab to EP chemotherapy has economic value compared with EP alone. In this study, we aimed to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of durvalumab plus EP chemotherapy as a first-line treatment for patients with ES-SCLC. Methods: A Markov model comprising three health states (stable, progressive, and dead) was developed to simulate the process of small-cell lung cancer. Utility and costs were obtained from published resources. Health outcomes were derived from the CASPIAN trial. Costs were calculated based on the standard medical fees in Zhejiang Province from Chinese patients\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 perspective. Utility values were obtained from published data. One-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were applied to verify model robustness. Results: The addition of durvalumab to EP chemotherapy costs more than $32,220, with a gain of 0.14 quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) compared with EP alone. The incremental cost-effective ratio was $230,142.9 per QALY, which exceeds the willingness to pay threshold of $28,527 per QALY. In the sensitivity analysis, the utility values for the progressive state, costs of durvalumab and EP chemotherapy, and costs for the progressive state were considered to be the three most sensitive factors in the model.

Background: The financial burden of managing hypertension in developing countries, where most of healthcare is funded out-of-pocket, is huge and poor patients cannot sustainably afford it. This is a challenge for most people, especially in sub-Sa-haran Africa with poor health indices, and this informed the investigation of the cost-effectiveness of anti-hypertensive drugs. Methodology: This was essentially a before-and-after study without control, in which blood pressure was assessed after commencing treatment with anti-hypertensive drugs among hypertensive patients. A systematic sampling technique was employed to recruit 320 participants from new patients attending cardiology clinic and admitted into the wards in four secondary health facilities offering specialized medical services in Nigeria. Results: The median cost of drug treatment of hypertension per week was N977.50; this cost was much lower for monotherapy than combined therapy. Similarly, the median costs of treatment per decrease in systolic and diastolic blood pressures were higher with combined therapy than monothe-rapy. The median cost of treatment per decrease in systolic blood pressure was higher than diastolic pressure. Diuretics had the most cost per decrease in diastolic blood pressure, while ACEI had the highest costs per decrease in systolic blood pressure and the highest cost per week. The lowest cost per week was recorded for beta-blockers, which also had the lowest cost per decrease in diastolic blood pressure and similar to the average cost per unit decrease in systolic blood pressure for centrally acting drugs. Conclusion: There was a significant improvement in blood pressure three months following the start of anti-hypertensive drugs.

Objectives: (1) To determine the overall treatment costs associated with isolated low-energy gunshot wounds (GSWs) to the extremity and (2) to estimate cost savings associated with a single-dose IV antibiotic strategy administered in the emergency room for patients with simple GSWs. Design: Retrospective review. Setting: Level I trauma center. Patients/Participants: Patients (N = 380) with extremity-only GSW injuries from 2010 to 2015 were retrospectively reviewed. Treatment was recorded including type and duration of antibiotics, admission, and surgical intervention. Main Outcome Measures: Costs were calculated including facility services in the operating room and hospital. Results: There were 460 GSWs in 380 patients with a mean age of 30 years old. There were 309 admissions, 273 operations performed, and 1010 days of antibiotics prescribed. The total inpatient facility cost to treat all patients was $1,701,154.

Efforts to prevent epilepsy in infants with tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) has been the focus of EPISTOP. Purpose: The present study was carried out to evaluate whether prevention could have been realistic. Methods: A retrospective analysis by hospital chart review of 31 patients with TSC and infantile spasms (practically all patients) admitted to two tertiary hospitals, Children's Hospital, University of Helsinki and Kuopio in 1980\u00e2\u20ac\u201c2000.

In brain imaging, subependymal periventricular calcifications or hypodense areas were seen in every patient at onset of IS. Other organ manifestations of TSC were retinal phakomas (6), polycystic kidneys (2), and renal angiolipomatosis (1).

This research retrospectively examines consecutive symptomatic adults who did not present to a hospital but who experience laboratory confirmed (nasopharyngeal swabs) or probable COVID-19 infection. From March 12 to April 12, 2020, 124 consecutive patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 infection (84%) or with epidemiologically linked exposure to a person with confirmed infection (16%) were managed at home. The diagnosis of pneumonia was made with a portable ultrasound. COVID-19 treatment was based on low-dose hydroxychloroquine with or without darunavir/cobicistat or azithromycin and enoxaparine for bedridden patients. The patients were monitored by telemedicine. The primary endpoints were clinical improvement or hospitalization, and the secondary endpoints were mortality at day 30 and at day 60.

Although the clinical profile and risk factors for CAM have been studied, cumulative mortality and its risk factors have not. Objective: To report the cumulative mortality rates at different times in cases with CAM and identify risk factors for CAM-associated mortality. Design, Setting, and Participants: This retrospective case-control study was conducted from March 1 to May 30, 2021, in a tertiary care multispecialty hospital in western India. All patients diagnosed with CAM and with a minimum follow-up of 30 days or those who died before 30 days due to CAM were included. Main Outcomes and Measure: Cumulative mortality in CAM using survival analysis. Results: A total of 73 consecutive patients with CAM with a mean (SD) age of 53.5 (12.5) years were included in the analysis, of whom 48 (66%) were men. CAM developed at a median of 28 (IQR, 15-45; range, 4-90) days after recovery from COVID-19. Of the 73 patients with CAM, 26 (36%) died; the cumulative probability of death was 26% (95% CI, 16%-41%) at day 7 and doubled to 53% (95% CI, 39%-69%) at day 21. Sinus debridement was performed in 18 of 51 patients (35%), and 5 of 52 (10%) underwent exenteration, whereas intravenous lyophilized amphotericin B was administered to 48 patients (66%).

Purpose: Genetic variation in the activation of the prodrug cyclophosphamide (CP) by cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes has been shown to influence outcomes. However, CYP are also subject to phenoconversion due to either the effects of comedications or cancer associated down-regulation of expression. The aim of this study was to assess the relationship between CP bioactivation with CYP2B6 and CYP2C19 genotype, as well as CYP2C19 phenotype, in breast cancer patients. Methods: CP and the active metabolite levels were assessed in breast cancer patients (n = 34) at cycle 1 and cycle 3 of treatment. Patients were genotyped for a series of SNP known to affect CYP2B6 and CYP2C19 function. The activity of CYP2C19 was also assessed using a probe drug. Results: We found a significant linear gene-dose relationship with CYP2B6 coding SNP and formation of 4-hydroxycyclophosphamide. A possible association with CYP2C19 null genotype at cycle 1 was obscured at cycle 3 due to the substantial intra-individual change in CP bioactivation on subsequent dosing. Conclusion: Comedications may be the cause for this inter-occasion variation in bioactivation of cyclophosphamide and the ensuing phenoconversion may account for the conflicting reports in the literature about the relationship between CYP2C19 genotype and CP bioactivation pharmacokinetics.

Background: The effect of coronavirus disease 2019 on the immune system is increasingly recognized. When severe, it causes immune dysregulation that may favor other infections, including Herpesviridae. Cytomegalovirus shares many innate immune pathways with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, which may potentiate each other. We describe a case of cytomegalovirus pneumonitis complicating the course of coronavirus disease 2019 in a patient with systemic lupus erythematosus/systemic sclerosis overlap and usual interstitial pneumonia, mimicking interstitial lung disease exacerbation. To the best of the authors\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 knowledge, this is the first case to be reported worldwide in the setting of connective tissue disease-associated interstitial lung disease.

After initial improvement, it was later complicated with cytomegalovirus pneumonitis, mimicking interstitial lung disease exacerbation. The case was successfully treated with ganciclovir. Conclusion: Intriguingly, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 and cytomegalovirus may potentiate each other, since they share some innate immune pathways.

STING is a universal receptor that recognizes cytosolic DNA and triggers innate immune activation. This study aims to elucidate the role of STING in the inflammation in psoriasis. STING deficiency alleviated psoriatic symptoms and inflammation in mouse models of psoriasis. Stimulation of macrophages with double-stranded DNA induced STING-dependent release of TNF-\u00ce\u00b1 and hydrogen peroxide in vitro.

Objective: Unknown etiology Background: Anovulation consists in the lack of oocyte release during the menstrual cycle, leading to an irregular menstrual cycle. Untreated chronic anovulation is one of the major causes of female infertility and can induce hypoestrogenism. Different etiological factors can contribute to anovulation; therefore, the clinical approaches to manage this condition should take into account the specific patient characteristics. Oral ovulation-inducing agents are first-line treatments for most anovulatory patients. Drugs used include selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs) such as clomiphene citrate and aromatase inhibitors (AIs) such as letrozole. The latter, in particular, halts the estrogen biosynthesis by blocking the activity of steroidogenic enzyme aromatase, which catalyzes the conversion of androgens to estrogens. Similarly, d-chiro-inositol (DCI) modulates the activity of aromatase by reducing the corresponding gene expression, and DCI supplementation was successfully used to induce ovulation in anovulatory PCOS patients. Here, we report the use of DCI to induce ovulation in non-PCOS anovulatory oligomenorrheic women. Case Reports: Two young non-PCOS anovulatory oligomenorrheic women received treatment with high-dose (1200 mg) DCI for 6 weeks. Based on an initial evaluation, both patients had normal hormone levels and were non-insulin-resistant. Ovulation assessment was based on the increment of progesterone and LH levels, as well as on the endometrial thickening. Also, the treatment with DCI resulted in a reduction of testosterone levels relative to baseline values. Conclusions: After the 6-week treatment with 1200 mg DCI, ovulation was restored in both women, as confirmed by in-creased progesterone and LH and endometrial thickening.",

These advantages may therefore compensate for the cost of dalbavancin, but no real-life assessment has been conducted to date. We aimed to assess the real-life budget impact of dalbavancin through its impact on the length of stay in French hospitals. Methods: A multicentre cohort based on the French registry of dalbavancin use in 2019 was compared to the French national discharge summary database. Lengths of stay and budget impact related to the infection type, the time of introduction of dalbavancin, the type of catheter and patient subgroups were assessed. An early switch was defined when dalbavancin was administered as the first or second treatment and within less than 11\u00c2\u00a0days of hospitalization. Results: A total of 179 patients were identified in the registry, and 154 were included in our study. Dalbavancin was mostly used for bone and joint infections (56.0%), infective endocarditis (19.0%) and acute bacterial skin and skin structure infections (6.0%). When compared to the data for similar patients in the national database, the length of stay was almost always shorter for patients treated with dalbavancin (up to a reduction of 13\u00c2\u00a0days). The budget impact for dalbavancin was heterogeneous but frequently generated savings (up to 2257.0\u00c2\u00a0\u00e2\u201a\u00ac).

Introduction: Acute pancreatitis associated with Pazopanib has been reported in the literature. Bitter Melon (Momordica Charantia) is traditionally used as a folk medicine in many regions. In this report, we describe a 65-year-old patient with a diagnosis of renal cell carcinoma, admitted to the hospital with symptoms of acute pancreatitis at the 8th year of pazopanib treatment. Case Report : The patient diagnosed with renal cell carcinoma was admitted to the hospital with the complaint of abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting in the 8th year of Pazopanib treatment.

Diabetes has increased radically in recent decades globally. Diabetes mainly emerged as a major health care problem in the world, among which type-2 diabetes is the most common. Protein tyrosine phosphatase 1B (PTP1B) is an important target for treating type-2 diabetes. Discovering new and effective treatment options for type-2 diabetes is currently of high international health importance. It is therefore expedient to identify the bioactive compounds of plants with inhibitory activity against PTP1B for designing drugs against type-2 diabetes. In the present study, a computational technique was used to identify bioactive compounds isolated from Allium sativum with PTP-1B inhibitory activity. A molecular docking study was achieved utilizing the Glide-Ligand Docking panel of Maestro 12.5 with Schr\u00c3\u00b6dinger Suite 2020-3. The binding free energy of the receptor-ligand complex was calculated using the MM-GBSA Prime panel. Pharmacophore models were generated using the PHASE module and the absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion, and toxicity (ADMET) properties of the compounds were assessed using SwissADME and PROTOX-II servers.

However, the underlying mechanism of this association remains unclear. Therefore, in this study, we aimed to clarify this association between FA chain length of CER, IFN-\u00ce\u00b3, and the major transcriptional factors involving psoriasis. CER profiling according to FA chain length and class was performed in murine epidermis (n\u00c2\u00a0=\u00c2\u00a010 BALB/c mice topically treated with imiquimod, n\u00c2\u00a0=\u00c2\u00a010 controls) and human stratum corneum (SC) (n\u00c2\u00a0=\u00c2\u00a012 psoriasis, n\u00c2\u00a0=\u00c2\u00a011 controls).

Furthermore, the association of IFN-\u00ce\u00b3 with various enzymes and transcription factors involved in the generation of long-chain CERs was also investigated using in vitro keratinocyte. A significant decrease in the percentage of long-chain CERs was observed in psoriasis-like murine epidermis and human psoriatic SC. Additionally, the expression levels of ELOVL1, ELOVL4, and ceramide synthase3 (CerS3) were significantly decreased in psoriasis-like murine epidermis and IFN-\u00ce\u00b3-treated keratinocyte. There was also a significant decrease in the expression of transcriptional factors, including peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR), in IFN-\u00ce\u00b3 treated keratinocyte. Thus, it could be suggested that IFN-\u00ce\u00b3 may regulate ELOVL and CerS levels by down-regulating the transcriptional factors.

Primary and secondary outcome measures Number of boys with DP after re-evaluation of the diagnosis according to the classical definition in comparison with puberty nomograms. Description of investigations performed and treatment provided to boys with DP. Results In total, 45 and 58 boys were found to have DP according to the classical definition and the nomograms, respectively. Biochemical and/or radiological testing was performed in 91% of the 58 boys, but an underlying disease was only found in 9% of them. Approximately 79% of the boys received testosterone treatment, either as injections of testosterone enanthate or as testosterone undecanoate. Conclusions Puberty nomograms may be helpful instruments when diagnosing pubertal disorders in boys as they are not limited to an age close to 14 years and also identify boys with pubertal arrest. The majority of boys with DP undergo biochemical or radiological examinations, but underlying diseases are unusual emphasising the need for structural clinical practice guidelines for this patient group.\n",

Delirium complicating regular use of psychoactive substances remains one of the major issues of critical care, toxicology, and psychiatry. However, the pathogenetic mechanisms of delirium development in patients with 1,4-butanediol poisoning have been poorly studied until now. The aim of the study was to reveal specific patterns of delirium in patients with 1,4-butanediol poisoning as well as to study the changes in systemic hemodynamic parameters, respiratory function, and body fluid compartments during the treatment. Material and methods. The study was prospective and treatment-randomized. Forty-eight male patients aged 20 to 45 years with delirium and acute 1,4-butanediol poisoning were enrolled. Of them, 24 patients were administered with succinate-containing drug 40 ml daily, 24 patients received standard treatment without antihypoxic agents. We studied the evolution of delirium, changes in anaerobic metabolism parameters, systemic hemodynamics, respiratory function, and the volume of fluid compartments. Impedance measurement method adjusted for interference was used in the study. Results. At the \u00c2\u00abpeak\u00c2\u00bb of delirium (days 1\u00e2\u20ac\u201c3), the hyperdynamic circulation, increased systemic arterial tone, stroke output, respiratory function parameters, and metabolic lactate acidosis were recorded. A decrease in total fluid volume and extracellular fluid volume was clearly observed during day 1 of intoxication delirium along with increased permeability of cell membranes. On day 3 of delirium, a decrease in intracellular fluid volume and increase in extracellular fluid volume were noted. After the cytoflavin administration, shorter delirium duration (7.5 [6; 8] days), more rapid correction of lactate acidosis, stabilization of respiratory parameters and stabilization of cell membrane permeability by day 5 were found. In the control group, delirium persisted for up to 14 [11; 15] days (z=-5.9; P=0.00011) with more frequent development of complications such as noso-comial pneumonia (\u00cf\u20212=8.4, P<0.001). Conclusion. The severity of delirium in acute poisoning with 1,4-butanediol was associated with metabolic lactate acidosis, changes in systemic hemodynamics and pulmonary function. A positive effect of adjunctive antihypoxic therapy with succinate-containing agent on cardio-respiratory parameters, cell membrane per-meability, water balance due to elimination of tissue hypoxia and prompt switching to tissue aerobic metabolism has been found.",

Objective: The proportion of patients who recommence clozapine after cessation, the time taken to resume clozapine post-cessation, and distinguishing demographic and clinical characteristics of this group have been poorly researched. We evaluated these in the current study. Method: We retrospectively extracted selected demographic and clinical variables and clozapine treatment interruption and recommencement data up to December 2018 of a cohort of 458 patients who first commenced clozapine between 2006 and 2016. The study was conducted at three Australian health services. Results: Of the 310 (69%) patients who had at least one interruption of clozapine treatment, 170 (54.8%) did not resume clozapine, and 140 (45.2%) recommenced it after the first interruption. More than half of those who recommenced did so within a month and 80% by 12\u00c2\u00a0months. Cox regression analysis revealed that age was significantly associated with recommencement, with a 2% decrease in the likelihood of restarting after an interruption for each year later that clozapine was initially commenced (HR\u00c2\u00a0=\u00c2\u00a00.98 95%CI: 0.97, 0.997, p\u00c2\u00a0=\u00c2\u00a00.02).

The in vitro antifungal activities of these compounds suggest that conjugates with specific chemical linkages showed better fungistatic activity than direct conjugates to POS. In particular, a polyethylene glycol (PEG)-imidazole modified G5 dendrimer demonstrated improved antifungal efficacy relative to the parent G5 molecule. Further studies were then conducted with POS derived molecules coupled to PEG-imidazole modified G5 dendrimers to achieve a highly soluble and active conjugate of POS.

The article discusses the release process of doxorubicin hydrochloride (DOX) from multiwall carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs).

The surface of carbon nanotubes (CNTs) has been modified via treatment in nitric acid to optimize the adsorption and release process. The modification efficiency and physicochemical properties of the MWCNTs+DOX system were analyzed by using SEM, TEM, EDS, FTIR, Raman Spectroscopy and UV-Vis methods. Based on computer simulations at pH 7.4 and the experiment at pH 5.4, the kinetics and the mechanism of DOX release from MWNT were discussed. It has been experimentally observed that the acidic pH (5.4) is appropriate for the efficient release of the drug from CNTs. It was noted that under acidic pH conditions, which is typical for the tumour microenvironment almost 90% of the drug was released in a relatively short time. The kinetics models based on different mathematical functions were used to describe the release mechanism of drugs from MWCNTs. Our studies indicated that the best fit of experimental kinetic curves of release has been observed for the Power-law model and the fitted parameters suggest that the drug release mechanism of DOX from MWCNTs is controlled by Fickian diffusion. Molecular dynamics simulations, on the other hand, have shown that in a neutral pH solution, which is close to the blood pH, the release process does not occur keeping the aggregation level constant.

Introduction: To describe pharmacist interventions as a result of an independent double check during cognitive order verification of outpatient parenteral anti-cancer therapy. Methods: A single-center, retrospective analysis of all individual orders for outpatient, parenteral anti-cancer agents within a hematology/oncology infusion center during a 30 day period was conducted. The primary endpoint was error identification rates during first and second verification. Secondary endpoints included the type, frequency, and severity of errors identified during second verification using a modified National Coordinating Council for Medication Error Reporting and Prevention Index. Results: A total of 1970 anti-cancer parenteral orders were screened, from which 1645 received an independent double check and were included. The number of errors identified during first and second verification were 30 (1.8%) and 10 (0.6%) respectively; second verification resulted in a 33.3% increase in corrected errors. The 10 errors identified during second verification included: four rate transcriptions to optimize pump interoperability, three rate and/or volume modifications, two dosage adjustments, and one treatment deferral due to toxicity. The severity was classified as Category A for four (40%), Category C for three (30%), and Category D for three (30%) errors. This correlated to a low capacity for harm for seven (70%) and a serious capacity for three (30%) errors. Conclusions: Second verification of outpatient, parenteral anti-cancer medication orders resulted in a 33.3% increase in corrected errors.

This study was designed to test the hypothesis of whether prescribing cascades exist and their magnitude among older individuals by using prescription sequence symmetry analysis (PSSA). Design: A retrospective population-based cohort study based on data from Taiwan's National Health Insurance Research Database (NHIRD), a nationwide claims-based database that covers 99% of the population in Taiwan. Setting and Participants: Patients receiving newly initiated index and marker drugs in the outpatient setting between 2014 and 2016 were included. Those who received index and marker drugs on the same date were excluded. Measures: PSSA measures the propensity for a marker drug (eg, thyroxine) to be prescribed after an index drug (eg, amiodarone) has been initiated, where the index drug is suspected of inducing a side effect (eg, hypothyroidism) and the marker drug is used to treat the side effect. We evaluated 14 PSSA sets as potential prescription cascade\u00e2\u20ac\u201crelated drug pairs (index and marker drug), including 2 confirmatory analyses (eg, amiodarone and thyroxin), to check the validity of the PSSA results and 12 exploratory analyses of cardiovascular medication\u00e2\u20ac\u201crelated prescribing cascades (eg, statins and antidepressants). The observation periods for sequences of incident marker drug use were 1 year before and 1 year after the use of the incident index drug, and the symmetry of prescriptions filled for the 2 periods was examined.

This analysis was designed to evaluate the effect of deucravacitinib on additional clinical and quality-of-life (QoL) outcomes and assess the relationship between these outcomes in adults with psoriasis. Methods: Post-hoc analysis of a 12-week Phase 2 trial was conducted for the three most efficacious dosage groups (3\u00c2\u00a0mg twice daily, 6\u00c2\u00a0mg twice daily, 12\u00c2\u00a0mg once daily) and placebo. Investigator assessments for efficacy included Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI), body surface area (BSA) involvement, and static Physician's Global Assessment; QoL was assessed using the Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI). Treatment responses and their associations were evaluated over time. Results: Deucravacitinib elicited improvement versus placebo as early as Week 4 for most efficacy measures (including changes in absolute PASI and BSA), with efficacy trends observed from Week 2 to Week 12. Improvements in QoL, assessed by achievement of a DLQI overall score of 0/1 (no effect at all on patient\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s life), followed a pattern similar to deucravacitinib-related clinical outcomes over 12\u00c2\u00a0weeks.

Background: Antimicrobial resistance is an increasingly serious threat to global public health. Antimicrobial stewardship programs need to identify inappropriate antibiotic use patterns and offer practical recommendations to prescribers and institutions. Urinary tract infection (UTI) is a common syndrome for which a standardized tool would be useful when treatment appropriateness is assessed. To date, few UTI treatment assessment tools have been published, and the available tools do not support appropriateness assessment against published guidelines, or consistent adjudication from one auditor to another. Objective: To develop a tool for auditing UTI antibiotic therapy that assesses treatment appropriateness based on guideline concordance, and with high inter-rater reliability. Methods: An audit tool was developed iteratively by the local antimicrobial stewardship team. Two auditors used the tool to adjudicate treatment appropriateness in a sample of UTI cases against local treatment guidelines. Inter-rater agreement was estimated with Cohen\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s kappa statistic. Results: The final design of the tool had individual sections for evaluating five aspects of treatment appropriateness, depending on the stage at which a patient was in his or her course of antibiotic therapy: diagnosis, empiric therapy, culture-directed therapy, route of antimicrobial administration, and duration of therapy. A total of 50 cases were assessed; among these, the two auditors agreed on 45 cases (90% agreement). The estimated kappa was 0.8. Conclusion: A unique tool with substantial inter-rater agreement was developed for assessing appropriateness of antimicrobial therapy in UTI.

Ferroptosis is a mode of regulated cell death that depends on iron and plays pivotal roles in regulating various biological processes in human cancers. However, the role of ferroptosis in gastric cancer (GC) remains unclear. In our study, a total of 2721 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were filtered based on The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) (n=375) dataset. Weighted gene coexpression network (WGCNA) analysis was then used and identified 7 modules, of which the blue module with the most significant enrichment result was selected. By taking the intersections of the blue module and ferroptosis-related genes (FRGs), we obtained 23 common genes. Functional analysis was performed to explore the biological function of the genes of interest, and with univariate Cox regression (UCR) analysis, survival genes were screened to construct a prognostic model based on 3 genes (SLC1A5, ANGPTL4, and CGAS), which could play a role in predicting the survival of GC patients. UCR and multivariate Cox regression (MCR) analysis revealed that the prognostic index could be used as an independent prognostic indicator and validated using another GSE84437 dataset. Notably, patients in the high-risk group had higher mutation frequencies, such as TTN and TP53. TIMER analysis demonstrated that the risk score strongly correlated with macrophage and CD4+ T cell infiltration. In addition, the high- and low-risk groups illustrated different distributions of different immune statuses. Furthermore, the low-risk group had a higher immunophenoscore (IPS), which meant a better response to immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs). Finally, gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) revealed several significant pathways involved in GC. In this study, a novel FRG signature was built that could predict GC prognosis and reflect the status of the tumor immune microenvironment.\n",

In these products, there is a possibility of the incomplete release of immediate release part (GMP and PGH) due to their entrapment into high viscosity gel barrier of MFH sustained-release part when drug product comes in contact with media. Therefore, the present study was aimed to deliver the above combination drugs in the form of hard gelatin capsules (as unit dosage form) containing MFH sustained-release (MFH-SR) pellets and immediate release pellets of PGH and GMP (PG-IR). Results: The MFH-SR and GP-IR pellets, prepared by extrusion and spheronization technique, were optimized based on the drug content and % cumulative drug release. The MFH-SR pellets formulation (batch A6) has shown maximum drug content, and sustained-release of MFH similar to marketed glucophage tablet while, the GP-IR pellets formulation (batch B5) has displayed maximum drug contents and immediate release of GMP and PGH; thus, these batches were considered for further characterizations.

Purpose: Adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH)-dependent Cushing's disease accounts for 75% cases of the endogenous Cushing's syndrome. The size of lesion is usually very small, which results in false-negative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) even after biochemical confirmation of the disease. Corticotrophin-releasing hormone (CRH) the key controller of hypothalamus-pituitary - adrenal axis binds to CRH receptor R1 and R2. CRH R1 is overexpressed in pituitary adenomas. The present study aims to target these overexpressed receptors with 68Ga-DOTA-CRH for noninvasive imaging of ACTH-dependent pituitary adenomas. Materials and Methods: Custom-synthesized 1,4,7,10-tetraazacyclododecane-1,4,7,10-tetraacetic acid (DOTA)-CRH peptide was purified by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and characterized by mass spectra. Postradiolabeling optimization with 68Ga, quality control tests were carried out to ensure the suitability of 68Ga DOTA-CRH for intravenous administration. A pilot study consisting of 15 patients including 6 known cases of macroadenoma underwent 68Ga-DOTA-CRH regional brain positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT). The optimal imaging time and biodistribution studies were performed in five patients' whole-body and serial brain PET/CT imaging. Lesion activity was determined as SUVmax and correlated with CE-MRI and histopathology of excised tissue. Results: A retention time of 11.3 min and mass of 5145 Da was observed on HPLC and mass spectra. Radiolabeling yield of >98% was achieved under optimized conditions using 25-100 \u00ce\u00bcg of conjugated peptide for 10-22 mCi of 68Ga. The quality control results were in agreement with acceptable criteria. 68Ga-DOTA-CRH was able to delineate ACTH secreting corticotropinoma in all 15 patients. Physiological uptake of radiotracer was observed in liver and spleen with diffused marrow activity. Excretion was noted by renal route.

However, due to the low ocular bioavailability, high doses are needed, causing bacterial resistance.

In this study, we have developed chitosan NPs based on sulfobutyl-ether-\u00ce\u00b2-cyclodextrin (CH/SBE-\u00ce\u00b2-CD NPs) for ocular delivery of LVF. CH/SBE-\u00ce\u00b2-CD NPs loading LVF were characterized in terms of encapsulation parameters, morphology, and sizes, in comparison to NPs produced without the macrocycle. Nuclear magnetic resonance and UV\u00e2\u20ac\u201cvis spectroscopy studies demonstrated that SBE-\u00ce\u00b2-CD is able to complex LVF and to influence encapsulation parameters of NPs, producing high encapsulation efficiency and LVF loading. The NPs were homogenous in size, with a hydrodynamic radius between 80 and 170 nm and positive zeta potential (\u00ce\u00b6) values. This surface property could promote the interaction of NPs with the negatively charged ocular tissue, increasing their residence time and, consequently, LVF efficacy. In vitro, antibacterial activity against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria showed a double higher activity of CH/SBE-\u00ce\u00b2-CD NPs loading LVF compared to the free drug, suggesting that chitosan NPs based on SBE-\u00ce\u00b2-CD could be a useful system for the treatment of ocular infections.",

Introduction: Positron emission tomography/computer tomography (PET/CT) targeting the prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) is crucial for the assessment of adequate PSMA expression in patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) prior to PSMA radioligand therapy (PSMA RLT). Moreover, initial dual tracer staging using combined PSMA and [18 F]fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) PET/CT provides relevant information, since discordant FDG-positive but PSMA-negative (FDG+/PSMA\u00e2\u02c6\u2019) lesions constitute a negative prognostic marker of overall survival (OS) after PSMA RLT. However, little is known about the prognostic implications of dual tracer imaging for restaging at follow-up. The aim of this analysis was to investigate the prognostic implications of new FDG+/PSMA\u00e2\u02c6\u2019 lesions during or after PSMA RLT. Methods: This bicentric analysis included 32 patients with mCRPC who underwent both FDG and PSMA PET/CT imaging after two or four cycles of PSMA RLT. Patients with FDG+/PSMA\u00e2\u02c6\u2019 lesions prior to PSMA RLT were not considered. The presence of FDG+/PSMA\u00e2\u02c6\u2019 lesions was assessed with follow-up dual tracer imaging of patients after two or four cycles of PSMA RLT. Patients with at least one new FDG+/PSMA\u00e2\u02c6\u2019 lesion were compared to patients without any FDG+/PSMA\u00e2\u02c6\u2019 lesions at the respective time points. A log-rank analysis was used to assess the difference in OS between subgroups. Results: After two cycles of PSMA RLT, four of 32 patients (13%) had FDG+/PSMA\u00e2\u02c6\u2019 metastases. No significant difference in OS was observed (p = 0.807), as compared to patients without FDG+/PSMA\u00e2\u02c6\u2019 lesions. Follow-up dual tracer imaging after the 4th cycle of PSMA RLT was available in 18 patients. Of these, four patients presented with FDG+/PSMA\u00e2\u02c6\u2019 findings (n = 2 already after two cycles). After the fourth cycle of PSMA RLT, no significant difference in OS was observed between patients with and without FDG+/PSMA\u00e2\u02c6\u2019 lesions (p = 0.442). Conclusion: This study shows that FDG+/PSMA\u00e2\u02c6\u2019 lesions develop in a limited number of patients undergoing PSMA RLT.

This study characterized the rate of new treatment episodes and treated prevalence of BPD and DMDD from a longitudinal electronic health record database and examined the impact of DMDD on prescription trends. Method: A retrospective cohort study using 2008-2018 Optum electronic health record data was conducted. Youth aged 10 to < 18 years with \u00e2\u2030\u00a5 183 days of database enrollment before the study cohort entry were included. Annual new treatment episode rates per 1,000 patient-years and treated prevalence (%) were estimated.

Compared with the CD diet, the CRHP diet further reduced HbA1c (mean [95% CI] \u00e2\u02c6\u20191.9 [\u00e2\u02c6\u20193.5, \u00e2\u02c6\u20190.3] mmol/mol [\u00e2\u02c6\u20190.18 (\u00e2\u02c6\u20190.32, \u00e2\u02c6\u20190.03)%], p = 0.018) and diurnal mean glucose (mean [95% CI] \u00e2\u02c6\u20190.8 [\u00e2\u02c6\u20191.2, \u00e2\u02c6\u20190.4] mmol/l, p\u00c2\u00a0< 0.001), stabilised glucose excursions by reducing glucose CV (mean [95% CI] \u00e2\u02c6\u20194.1 [\u00e2\u02c6\u20195.9, \u00e2\u02c6\u20192.2]%, p\u00c2\u00a0< 0.001), and augmented the reductions in fasting triacylglycerol concentration (by mean [95% CI] \u00e2\u02c6\u201918 [\u00e2\u02c6\u201929, \u00e2\u02c6\u20196]%, p\u00c2\u00a0< 0.01) and liver fat content (by mean [95% CI] \u00e2\u02c6\u201926 [\u00e2\u02c6\u201945, 0]%, p = 0.051). However, pancreatic fat content was decreased to a lesser extent by the CRHP than the CD diet (mean [95% CI] 33 [7, 65]%, p = 0.010). Fasting glucose, insulin, HOMA2-IR and cholesterol concentrations (total, LDL and HDL) were reduced significantly and similarly by both diets. Conclusions/interpretation: Moderate carbohydrate restriction for 6\u00c2\u00a0weeks modestly improved glycaemic control, and decreased circulating and intrahepatic triacylglycerol levels beyond the effects of weight loss itself compared with a CD diet in individuals with type 2 diabetes. Concurrent differences in protein and fat intakes, and the quality of dietary macronutrients, may have contributed to these results and should be explored in future studies.

To investigate the efficacy differences between acyclovir and ganciclovir in the treatment of children with Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)- associated infectious mononucleosis (IM). Methods. A total of 128 children with EBV-IM who were admitted to our hospital from February 2019 to February 2021 were selected and randomly divided into the acyclovir group (n = 64) and the ganciclovir group (n = 64) according to the random number table method. All the children were given symptomatic treatments such as protecting the liver and reducing fever. On this basis, the acyclovir group was given an intravenous drip of acyclovir, while the ganciclovir group was given an intravenous drip of ganciclovir. The treatment was continued for 7 days. After the treatment, the clinical efficacy, disappearance time of symptoms and signs, related blood routine indexes, EBV-DNA negative conversion rate, and the incidence of adverse reactions during the treatment were compared between the two groups. Results. After treatment, the total effective rate of the ganciclovir group (92.19%) was higher than that of the acyclovir group (73.44%) and the difference was statistically significant P<0.05. The disappearance time for the symptoms and signs of angina, fever, lymphadenopathy, hepatomegaly, and splenomegaly in the ganciclovir group was lower than that in the acyclovir group, and the difference was statistically significant P<0.05. After treatment, the levels of atypical lymphocyte proportion, lymphocyte proportion, and WBC count in the two groups were lower than those before treatment, the levels in the ganciclovir group were lower than those in the acyclovir group, and the difference was statistically significant P<0.05. After treatment, the EBV-DNA negative conversion rate (81.25%) in the ganciclovir group was higher than that in the acyclovir group (60.93%) and the difference was statistically significant P<0.05. During treatment, the incidence of adverse reactions in the ganciclovir group was significantly lower than that in the acyclovir group and the difference was statistically significant P<0.05. Conclusion. In the treatment of children with EBV-IM, the therapeutic effect of ganciclovir is obviously superior to that of acyclovir.

Background: Biological rhythm plays an important role in major depressive disorder (MDD). The efficacy of antidepressant in biological rhythm remains unclear. This study is designed to explore the efficiency of escitalopram and mirtazapine in improving circadian rhythm, diurnal mood variation(DMV) and daily activity in MDD patients. Methods: Four-hundred and fifty participants diagnosed with MDD were randomized to receive treatment with escitalopram (TWE), treatment with mirtazapine (TWM) or treatment as usual (TAU). Biological rhythm symptoms were assessed by relevant biological subscale in the Hamilton depression scale (HAMD) and the quick inventory of depressive symptomatology self-report (QIDS).

Aims/hypothesis: In men with diabetes, the prevalence of erectile dysfunction increases with advanced age and longer diabetes duration and is substantially higher in men with type 2 diabetes than those with type 1 diabetes. This study aimed to evaluate the prevalence of erectile dysfunction among the five novel subgroups of recent-onset diabetes and determine the strength of associations between diabetes subgroups and erectile dysfunction. Methods: A total of 351 men with recent-onset diabetes (<1\u00c2\u00a0year) from the German Diabetes Study baseline cohort and 124 men without diabetes were included in this cross-sectional study. Erectile dysfunction was assessed with the International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF) questionnaire. Poisson regression models were used to estimate associations between diabetes subgroups (each subgroup tested against the four other subgroups as reference) and erectile dysfunction (dependent binary variable), adjusting for variables used to define diabetes subgroups, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein and depression. Results: The prevalence of erectile dysfunction was markedly higher in men with diabetes than in men without diabetes (23% vs 11%, p = 0.004). Among men with diabetes, the prevalence of erectile dysfunction was highest in men with severe insulin-resistant diabetes (SIRD) (52%), lowest in men with severe autoimmune diabetes (SAID) (7%), and intermediate in men with severe insulin-deficient diabetes (SIDD), mild obesity-related diabetes (MOD) and mild age-related diabetes (MARD) (31%, 18% and 29%, respectively). Men with SIRD had an adjusted RR of 1.93 (95% CI 1.04, 3.58) for prevalent erectile dysfunction (p = 0.038). Similarly, men with SIDD had an adjusted RR of 3.27 (95% CI 1.18, 9.10) (p = 0.023). In contrast, men with SAID and those with MARD had unadjusted RRs of 0.26 (95% CI 0.11, 0.58) (p = 0.001) and 1.52 (95% CI 1.04, 2.22) (p = 0.027), respectively. However, these associations did not remain statistically significant after adjustment. Conclusions/interpretation: The high RRs for erectile dysfunction in men with recent-onset SIRD and SIDD point to both insulin resistance and insulin deficiency as major contributing factors to this complication, suggesting different mechanisms underlying erectile dysfunction in these subgroups.

This study aimed to compare intraocular pressures (IOP) using different tonometers, Gold-mann applanation (IOPGAT ), non-contact (IOPNCT ), and rebound (IOPRBT ), and to assess the effects of aging and central corneal thickness (CCT) on the measurements. The IOPGAT, IOPNCT, IOPRBT, mean patient age (65.1 \u00c2\u00b1 16.2 years), and CCT (521.7 \u00c2\u00b1 39.2 \u00c2\u00b5m) were collected retrospectively from 1054 eyes. The differences among IOPs were compared by the paired t-test. Possible correlations between devices, age, and CCT were assessed by linear regression analyses. The effects of age and CCT on the IOP reading were assessed by mixed-effects regression models. The IOPGAT values were 2.4 and 1.4 mmHg higher than IOPNCT and IOPRBT, respectively; the IOPNCT was 1.0 mmHg lower than IOPRBT (p < 0.0001 for all comparisons).

Albino Swiss mice were infected and treated with high and low concentrations of BZ (100 or 6.25 mg/kg), CLO (5 or 1.25 mg/kg), or the combination of both low doses (BZ6.25 + CLO1.25), during the acute phase of experimental infection.

For DTUs genotyping, blood, skeletal and cardiac muscle samples were analysed by multiplex quantitative polymerase chain reaction. The combined treatment had similar outcomes to BZ6.25; BZ100 was the most effective treatment, but it failed to reach parasite clearance and produced greater histological alterations. Non-Treated mice and the ones treated with monotherapies showed both DTUs while BZ6.25 + CLO1.25 treated mice showed only TcVI parasites in all the tissues studied.

In spite of early interventions to treat acute myocardial infarction (MI), the occurrence of adverse cardiac remodeling following heart failure due to acute MI remains a clinical challenge. Thus, there is an increasing demand for the development of novel therapeutic agents capable of inhibiting the development of pathological ventricular remodeling. RNA-seq data analysis of acute MI rat models from GEO revealed that Runx1 was the most differentially expressed MI-related gene. In this study, we demonstrated that increased Runx1 expression under pathological conditions results in decreased cardiac contractile function. We identified dihydrolycorine, an alkaloid lycorine, as a promising inhibitor of Runx1. Our results showed that treatment with this drug could prevent adverse cardiac remodeling, as indicated by the downregulation of fibrotic genes using western blotting (collagen I, TGF\u00ce\u00b2, and p-smad3), downregulation of the apoptosis gene Bax, upregulation of the apoptosis gene Bcl-2, and improved cardiac functions, such as LVEF, LVSF, LVESD, and LVEDD. Additionally, dihydrolycorine treatment could rescue cardiomyocyte hypertrophy as demonstrated by wheat germ agglutinin staining, increased expression levels of the punctuate gap junction protein connexin 43, and decreased \u00ce\u00b1-SMA expression, resulting in cardiomyocyte fibrosis in immunofluorescence staining. Molecular docking, binding modeling, and pull-down assays were used to identify potential dihydrolycorine-binding sites in Runx1. When Ad-sh-Runx1 was transfected into hypoxia-cardiomyocytes or injected into the hearts of MI rats, the cardioprotective effects of dihydrolycorine were abolished, and the normal electrophysiological activity of cardiomyocytes was disrupted. Taken together, the results of the present study indicate that dihydrolycorine may inhibit adverse cardiac remodeling after MI through the reduction of Runx1, suggesting that dihydrolycorine-mediated-Runx1 regulation might represent a novel therapeutic approach for adverse cardiac remodeling after MI.\n",

Here, we show that phenethyl isothiocyanate (PEITC), a natural compound present in cruciferous vegetables, can significantly alleviate concanavalin A (ConA)-induced inflammatory liver damage and carbon tetrachloride (CCl4)-induced chemical liver damage in a dose-dependent manner.

KCC2 loss-of-function is associated with seizures and epilepsy. Here, we show that KCC2 is expressed in the majority of parvalbumin-positive interneurons (PV-INs) of the mouse brain. PV-INs receive excitatory input from principle cells and in turn control principle cell activity by perisomatic inhibition and inhibitory input from other interneurons. Upon Cre-mediated disruption of KCC2 in mice, the polarity of the GABA response of PV-INs changed from hyperpolarization to depolarization for the majority of PV-INs. Reduced excitatory postsynaptic potential-spike (E-S) coupling and increased spontaneous inhibitory postsynaptic current (sIPSC) frequencies further suggest that PV-INs are disinhibited upon disruption of KCC2. In vivo, PV-IN-specific KCC2 knockout mice display a reduced seizure threshold and develop spontaneous sometimes fatal seizures.

Importance: Little is known about changes in care for individuals with severe mental illness during the COVID-19 pandemic. Objective: To examine changes in mental health care during the pandemic and the use of telemedicine in outpatient care among Medicare beneficiaries with severe mental illness. Design, Setting, and Participants: This population-based cohort study included Medicare beneficiaries (age \u00e2\u2030\u00a518 years) diagnosed with schizophrenia and schizophrenia-related disorders or bipolar I disorder. Care patterns during January to September 2020 for a cohort defined in 2019 were compared with those during January to September 2019 for a cohort defined in 2018. Exposures: Start of COVID-19 pandemic in the United States, defined as week 12 of 2020. Main Outcomes and Measures: Use of mental health-related outpatient visits, emergency department visits, inpatient care, and oral prescription fills for antipsychotics and mood stabilizers during 4-week intervals. Multivariable logistic regression analyses examined whether the pandemic was associated with differential changes in outpatient care across patient characteristics. Results: The 2019 cohort of 686214 individuals included 389245 (53.8%) women, 114073 (15.8%) Black and 526301 (72.8%) White individuals, and 477353 individuals (66.0%) younger than 65 years; the 2020 cohort of 723045 individuals included 367140 (53.5%) women, 106699 (15.6%) Black and 497885 (72.6%) White individuals, and 442645 individuals (64.5%) younger than 65 years. Compared with 2019, there were large decreases during the pandemic's first month (calendar weeks 12-15) in individuals with outpatient visits (265169 [36.7%] vs 200590 [29.2%]; 20.3% decrease), with antipsychotic and mood stabilizer medication prescription fills (216468 [29.9%] vs 163796 [23.9%]; 20.3% decrease), with emergency department visits (12383 [1.7%] vs 8503 [1.2%]; 27.7% decrease), and with hospital admissions (11564 [1.6%] vs 7912 [1.2%]; 27.9% decrease).

Sepsis is a dysregulated immune response to infection and potentially leads to life-threatening organ dysfunction, which is often seen in serious Covid-19 patients. Disulfiram (DSF), an old drug that has been used to treat alcohol addiction for decades, has recently been identified as a potent inhibitor of the gasdermin D (GSDMD)-induced pore formation that causes pyroptosis and inflammatory cytokine release. Therefore, DSF represents a promising therapeutic for the treatment of inflammatory disorders. Lactoferrin (LF) is a multifunctional glycoprotein with potent antibacterial and anti-inflammatory activities that acts by neutralizing circulating endotoxins and activating cellular responses. In addition, LF has been well exploited as a drug nanocarrier and targeting ligands. In this study, we developed a DSF-LF nanoparticulate system (DSF-LF NP) for combining the immunosuppressive activities of both DSF and LF. DSF-LF NPs could effectively block pyroptosis and inflammatory cytokine release from macrophages. Treatment with DSF-LF NPs showed remarkable therapeutic effects on lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced sepsis. In addition, this therapeutic strategy was also applied to treat ulcerative colitis (UC), and substantial treatment efficacy was achieved in a murine colitis model. The underlying mode of action of these DSF-LF-NPs may contribute to efficiently suppressing macrophage-mediated inflammatory responses and ameliorating the complications caused by sepsis and UC. As macrophage pyroptosis plays a pivotal role in inflammation, this safe and effective biomimetic nanomedicine may offer a versatile therapeutic strategy for treating various inflammatory diseases by repurposing DSF.

We evaluated the association between skin toxicity and clinical efficacy outcomes of these agents in mRCC patients. Methods and Materials: Data were obtained from patients with mRCC treated with TKIs and/or ICIs from 2016\u00e2\u20ac\u201c2019 at a referral hospital in Mexico City. Clinical outcomes were compared among patients who developed treatment-related cutaneous adverse events (AEs) and those without skin toxicity.

Chemoinformatics appraisal and molecular docking were employed to investigate 225 complexes of 75 schizophrenia antipsychotics with the dopamine receptor subtypes D2R, D3R, and D4R. Considering the effective noncovalent interactions in the subtype-D2 receptor selectivity of antipsychotics, this study evaluated the possible physicochemical properties of ligands underlying the design of safer and more effective antipsychotics. The pan-Assay interference compounds (PAINs) include about 25% of typical antipsychotics and 5% of atypicals. Popular antipsychotics like haloperidol, clozapine, risperidone, and aripiprazole are not PAINs. They have stronger interactions with D2R and D4R, but their interactions with D3R are slightly weaker, which is similar to the behavior of dopamine. In contrast to typical antipsychotics, atypical antipsychotics exhibit more noncovalent interactions with D4R than with D2R. These results suggest that selectivity to D2R and D4R comes from the synergy between hydrophobic and hydrogen-bonding interactions through their concomitant occurrence in the form of a hydrogen-bonding site adorned with hydrophobic contacts in antipsychotic-receptor complexes. All the antipsychotics had more synergic interactions with D2R and D4R in comparison with D3R. The atypical antipsychotics made a good distinction between the subtype D2 receptors with high selectivity to D4R. Among the popular antipsychotics, haloperidol, clozapine, and risperidone have hydrophobic-hydrogen-bonding synergy with D4R, while aripiprazole profits with D2R.

The MTD was not determined in 27 out of 60 cases (59%). When the MTD was determined but not applied as final dose, the most frequently used dose selection criteria were the combination of toxicity, exposure response, pharmacokinetic data and pharmacodynamic data (in 7 out of 18 cases). Data on tolerability were analysed separately for protein kinase inhibitors and monoclonal antibodies as the dosing interval and mitigation of adverse events (AEs) differs.

Materials and Methods: The present study was conducted in Department of Pharmacology, SKMC, Muzaffarpur, Bihar by collecting data from medical record department. Detailed data of patients diagnosed with epilepsy including demographic details, comorbidities, and allergies admitted during last 3 months in study pro forma were collected. Results: A total of 150 patient\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s data were analyzed and it was found that male patients were most affected with epilepsy compared to females. Generalized tonic-clonic seizure (GTCS) was the most commonly diagnosed in majority of the patients. Levetiracetam (42.0%) was the most commonly prescribed drug as monotherapy, followed by phenytoin (12.66%), sodium valproate (8.66%), and carbamazepine (5.33%). The most common combination of drugs in polytherapy were levetiracetam and carbamazepine (13.33%), phenytoin with carbamazepine (7.33%), phenytoin with sodium valproate (6.66%), and phenytoin with lamotrigine (4.0%). Conclusion: The higher incidence of epilepsy is noted in males of all ages. GTCS was the most common type of epilepsy diagnosed and majority of the patients were prescribed with monotherapy. As it is a retrospective study, there were several limitations in the study such as quality of life of patients, compliance to the drugs, adverse reactions to the drugs were not assessed. Hence, further prospective studies with more sample size should be conducted to assess various factors on drug utilization in epilepsy.",

It is well-known that inappropriate drug use results in problems like drug interactions, ecological disturbance and affects overall treatment. These studies should be conducted to decrease drug and health related treatment expenditure, to improve health related quality of life, to improve medical treatment quality, to decrease the number of medication related problems and errors, to decrease hospitalization, to improve prescriber's practice and awareness towards appropriate prescribing. Methodology: This is a retrospective and prospective observational study, conducted over a period of six months (October 2019-March 2020). The required data of the patients, meeting the inclusion criteria, was documented in data collection form and analyzed. Results: During the study period, a total of 85 patients were enrolled and most of the patients were in the age group of 60 to 69 years (35.2%) and majority being males 56 (65.8%). The most common comorbid illness was hypertension (80%). This study showed that combination therapy is mostly preferred 62.3%. The most common drug used was metformin as monotherapy and metformin plus glimepiride as combination therapy and also showed that most of the patients received at least one antibiotic (50.58%).

PURPOSE Prognosis for adult B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) is poor, and there are currently no licensed CD19 chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) therapeutics. We developed a novel second-generation CD19- CAR (CAT19-41BB-Z) with a fast off rate, designed for more physiologic T-cell activation to reduce toxicity and improve engraftment. We describe the multicenter phase I ALLCAR19 (NCT02935257) study of autologous CAT19-41BB-Z CAR T cells (AUTO1) in relapsed or refractory (r/r) adult B-ALL. METHODS Patients age $ 16 years with r/r B-ALL were eligible. Primary outcomes were toxicity and manufacturing feasibility. Secondary outcomes were depth of response at 1 and 3 months, persistence of CAR-T, incidence and duration of hypogammaglobulinemia and B-cell aplasia, and event-free survival and overall survival at 1 and 2 years. RESULTS Twenty-five patients were leukapheresed, 24 products were manufactured, and 20 patients were infused with AUTO1. The median age was 41.5 years; 25% had prior blinatumomab, 50% prior inotuzumab ozogamicin, and 65% prior allogeneic stem-cell transplantation. At the time of preconditioning, 45% had $ 50% bone marrow blasts. No patients experienced $ grade 3 cytokine release syndrome; 3 of 20 (15%) experienced grade 3 neurotoxicity that resolved to # grade 1 within 72 hours with steroids. Seventeen of 20 (85%) achieved minimal residual disease-negative complete response at month 1, and 3 of 17 underwent allogeneic stem-cell transplantation while in remission. The event-free survival at 6 and 12 months was 68.3% (42.4%-84.4%) and 48.3% (23.1%-69.7%), respectively. High-level expansion (Cmax 127,152 copies/mg genomic DNA) and durable CAR-T persistence were observed with B-cell aplasia ongoing in 15 of 20 patients at last follow-up.

Introduction There is controversy regarding the importance of air-transmitted infections for surgical site infections (SSIs) after orthopaedic surgery. Research has been hindered by both the inability in blinding the exposure, and by the need for recruiting large enough cohorts. The aim of this study is to investigate whether using a new form of air purifier using plasma air purification (PAP) in operating rooms (ORs) lowers the SSI rate or not. Methods and analysis Multicentre, double-blind, cluster-randomised, placebo-controlled trial conducted at seven hospitals in 2017-2022. All patients that undergo orthopaedic surgery for minimum 30 min are included. Intervention group: patients operated in OR with PAP devices turned on. Control group: patients operated in OR with PAP devices turned off. Randomisation: each OR will be randomised in periods of 4 weeks, 6 weeks or 8 weeks to either have the devices on or off. Primary outcome: any SSI postoperatively defined as a composite endpoint of any of the following: use of isoxazolylpenicillin, clindamycin or rifampicin for 2 days or more, International Classification of Diseases codes or Nordic Medico-Statistical Committee codes indicating postoperative infection. In a second step, we will perform a chart review on those patients with positive indicators of SSI to further validate the outcome. Secondary outcomes are described in the Methods section. Power: we assume an SSI rate of 2%, an SSI reduction rate of 25% and we need approximately 45 000 patients to attain a power of 80% at a significance level of 0.05. Ethics and dissemination The study is approved by the Swedish Ethical Review Authority. The interim analysis results from the study will be presented only to the researchers involved unless the study thereafter is interrupted for whatever reason.

Background: Early onset of action has become recognized as an important efficacy feature of preventive migraine treatment, which can help overcome adherence issues commonly associated with older medications. Preventive treatments that target the calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) or the CGRP receptor have been previously shown to provide early onset of action. Methods: This subanalysis of primary endpoints of two separate phase 2b/3 studies sought to determine the onset of action of fremanezumab in Japanese and Korean patients with episodic migraine (EM) and chronic migraine (CM). Results: In EM patients (n = 357), both fremanezumab quarterly and fremanezumab monthly led to greater reductions in weekly migraine days (days/week) than placebo from the first week after the initial injection and thereafter during the remainder of the study period. Similarly, CM patients (n = 571) had a greater reduction in headache days of at least moderate severity (days/week) with fremanezumab (total) than placebo. The percentage of patients with a migraine day (EM) or headache day at least moderate severity (CM) was lower in those treated with fremanezumab than placebo and this effect was apparent from as early as Day 2 (1 day after first injection).

BACKGROUND: Heterogeneity exists in the response of triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) to standard anthracycline (AC)/taxane-based neoadjuvant systemic therapy (NAST), with 40% to 50% of patients having a pathologic complete response (pCR) to therapy. Early assessment of the imaging response during NAST may identify a subset of TNBCs that are likely to have a pCR upon completion of treatment. The authors aimed to evaluate the performance of early ultrasound (US) after 2 cycles of neoadjuvant NAST in identifying excellent responders to NAST among patients with TNBC. METHODS: Two hundred fifteen patients with TNBC were enrolled in the ongoing ARTEMIS (A Robust TNBC Evaluation Framework to Improve Survival) clinical trial. The patients were divided into a discovery cohort (n = 107) and a validation cohort (n = 108). A receiver operating characteristic analysis with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) and a multivariate logistic regression analysis were performed to model the probability of a pCR on the basis of the tumor volume reduction (TVR) percentage by US from the baseline to after 2 cycles of AC. RESULTS: Overall, 39.3% of the patients (42 of 107) achieved a pCR. A positive predictive value (PPV) analysis identified a cutoff point of 80% TVR after 2 cycles; the pCR rate was 77% (17 of 22) in patients with a TVR \u00e2\u2030\u00a5 80%, and the area under the curve (AUC) was 0.84 (95% CI, 0.77-0.92; P <.0001).

Introduction: Budesonide orodispersible tablets (BOT) have been approved in Europe and Canada for the treatment of eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE), a rare and chronic disease. The objective of this study was to assess the economic impact of BOT on both the induction and maintenance of clinico-pathological remission of EoE by performing a cost\u00e2\u20ac\u201cutility analysis (CUA). Methods: For both the induction and maintenance settings, BOT was compared to no treatment in a target population of adult patients with EoE non-responsive to proton pump inhibitor (PPI) treatment. Markov models were developed for the induction and maintenance settings over 52-week and life-time horizons, respectively. Analyses were performed from both a Canadian Ministry of Health (MoH) and societal perspective. The resulting incremental cost\u00e2\u20ac\u201cutility ratios (ICURs) were compared to a willingness-to-pay (WTP) threshold of $50,000 Canadian dollars/quality-adjusted life-year (QALY).

Methods: The closed cranial window technique was used in rabbits to measure changes in pial arteriolar diameter after the unclamping of abdominal aortic cross-clamping with an intravenous free radical scavenger, edaravone (control group [n = 6], edaravone 10 \u00ce\u00bcg/kg/ min [n = 6], 100 \u00ce\u00bcg/kg/min [n = 6]). Pial vasodilatory responses to topical application of acetylcholine (ACh) into the cranial window were investigated before abdominal aortic cross-clamping and after unclamping with intravenous administration of edaravone (con-trol group [n = 6], edaravone 100 \u00ce\u00bcg/kg/min [n = 6]). Results: Aortic unclamping-induced vasoconstriction was significantly attenuated by continuous infusion of edaravone at 100 \u00ce\u00bcg/kg/min. Topical ACh after unclamping did not pro-duce any changes in pial arteriolar responses in comparison to before aortic cross-clamping in the control or edaravone groups. The changes in the response to topical ACh after un-clamping in the saline and edaravone groups did not differ significantly. Conclusions: Free radicals during abdominal aortic surgery might have contracted cerebral blood vessels independently of endothelial function in rabbits. Suppression of free radicals attenuated the sustained pial arteriolar vasoconstriction after aortic unclamping. Thus, the free radical scavenger might have some brain protective effect that maintains CBF independently of endothelial function.",

To explore the therapeutic effect of amoxicillin and clavulanate potassium combined with Bazhengsan on pediatric urinary tract infection (UTI). Methods. The data of 120 UTI children treated in Wuhan Xinzhou District People's Hospital from February 2019 to February 2020 were retrospectively analyzed. They were equally split into experimental group (EG) and control group (CG) according to the order of admission. All children were treated with amoxicillin and clavulanate potassium for suspension (twice a day), and EG was additionally treated with one dose of Bazhengsan daily. Both groups were treated for 10 days. After treatment, the immune function indexes, inflammatory factor levels, and clinical efficacy were compared before and after treatment. Results. No remarkable differences in the general data such as blood routine and urine routine results were observed between the two groups before treatment (P>0.05). After treatment, EG achieved obviously better immune function indexes (P<0.001) and lower levels of inflammatory factors (P<0.05) compared with CG. Besides, the treatment effective rate in EG (96.7%) was higher than that in CG (P<0.05). Conclusion.

BDNF and CREB play a vital role in protecting and regulating the proper functioning of neurons. There has not been any study on the effect of methadone maintenance treatment and its comparison with morphine. Therefore, this study was conducted to examine the effect of methadone maintenance on the expression of BDNF and CREB genes in brain VTA of male morphine treated rats. Methods: In this study, 24 Wistar rats (200-250g) were assigned to three experimental groups: 1) Animals without morphine treatment (control); 2) Morphine treated animals (10 mg/kg, twice/day through subcutaneous injection for 21 days); 3) Animals under methadone maintenance after treatment with morphine (maintenance dose of methadone was achieved during 14 days equal to 1 mg per 100 ml at the first week and 2.5 mg per 100 ml at second week). To evaluate the expression of BDNF and CREB genes, real time PCR method was used, and ELISA was applied to measure the serum level of BDNF protein at the end of the experiment. Results: According to the findings of this study, similar to morphine treated group, methadone maintenance in morphine treated animals led to a significant reduction in the expression of BDNF and CREB genes at VTA as well BDNF serum level compared with the control group.

We have previously characterized the vegetables via HPLC/LC-MS to reveal notable phenolic acids, flavonoids and alkaloids. In this present study, we addressed the efficacy of the two vegetables in mitigating mercuric chloride (HgCl2)-induced neurotoxicity and memory impairment in Drosophila melanogaster. Flies were exposed to HgCl2 (0.30\u00c2\u00a0mg/g) alone or in combination with the vegetables (0.1 and 1.0%) of both samples in their diets for seven days. The results showed that HgCl2 (Hg)-exposed flies had significantly reduced survival rate and memory index, which were ameliorated in the Hg-exposed flies fed AE or BN. This was accompanied by increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels, reduced total thiol, as well as catalase, glutathione transferase (GST) and acetylcholine esterase (AChE) activities in Hg-exposed fly heads, but ameliorated in Hg-exposed flies fed dietary inclusions of the vegetables.

An understanding of the consequences of oxidative/halogenative stress triggered by neutrophil activation is impossible without considering NETosis. NETosis, formation of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs), is known to promote microthrombus formation and impair wound healing in type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) patients. Therefore, there is a need to search for drugs and treatment approaches that could prevent excessive NET formation. We aimed to evaluate the effect of vitamin D3 in combination with omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (vitamin D3/omega-3 PUFAs) on NETosis in T2DM patients with purulent necrotizing lesions of the lower extremities. Patients and healthy subjects had vitamin D3 deficiency. Patients received, beyond standard treatment, 6000 IU of vitamin D3 and 480 mg of omega-3 PUFAs, and healthy subjects 1000 IU of vitamin D3 and 240 mg of omega-3 PUFAs daily for seven days. Neutrophil activation in ex vivo blood by phorbol-12-myristate-13-acetate (PMA) was used as a NETosis model. The percentage of blood NETs relative to leukocytes (NETbackground) before vitamin D3/omega-3 PUFA supplementation was 3.2%-4.9% in healthy subjects and 1.7%-10.8% in patients. These values rose, respectively, to 7.7%-9.1% and 4.0%-17.9% upon PMA-induced NETosis. In addition, the leukocyte count decreased by 700-1300 per 1 \u00ce\u00bcL in healthy subjects and 700-4000 per 1 \u00ce\u00bcL in patients. For both patients and healthy subjects, taking vitamin D3/omega-3 PUFAs had no effect on NETbackground but completely inhibited PMA-induced NET formation, though neutrophils exhibited morphological features of activation. Also, leukocyte loss was reduced (to 500 per 1 \u00ce\u00bcL). For patients on standard treatment alone, changes occurred neither in background NETs and leukocytes nor in their amount after PMA stimulation.

Aims: Dysfunction of the blood\u00e2\u20ac\u201cbrain barrier (BBB) is a prominent pathological feature of glioblastoma (GBM). Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is confirmed to be abnormally elevated in the pathogenesis of GBM, causing BBB pathological disruption, which further allows the leakage of neurotoxic blood-derived molecules into the central nervous system (CNS), interfering brain homeostasis and leading to poor patient outcome. Since BBB is an integral and pivotal part of the brain microenvironment, which strongly supports the occurrence and the pathological progression of GBM, here we have selected the VEGFR antagonist axitinib as a BBB functional regulator and hypothesized to regulate pathological BBB restoration for GBM effective treatment. Methods: The pathological BBB cell model was constructed to investigate the timeliness and dose effect of axitinib regulating pathological BBB restoration. In order to investigate the efficacy and safety of axitinib regulating pathological BBB restoration for anti-GBM treatment, the orthotropic GBM-bearing mice model was established for in vivo study, and bioluminescent imaging was used to real-time and noninvasively monitor tumor growth response in vivo, and survival time was also recorded. Results: Axitinib under non-cytotoxic dosage regulated pathological BBB restoration in a time-dependent mode, and multiple intervention of axitinib could realize a visible restoration of pathological BBB in vitro. Moreover, axitinib treatment restored pathological BBB in orthotropic GBM-bearing mice. We further confirmed that functional restoration of pathological BBB with axitinib had certain curative effect in prolonging median survival of orthotropic GBM-bearing mice at non-cytotoxic dosages in vivo. Conclusion: The mechanism of axitinib involved in BBB functional regulation in the treatment of GBM is first illuminated in this report; moreover, this is the first report first referring to regulating pathological BBB functional recovery for GBM effective therapeutics.

Metformin treatment had a small but positive effect on bone quality in the peripheral skeleton, reduced weight gain, and resulted in a more beneficial body composition compared with placebo in insulin-treated patients with type 2 diabetes. Introduction: Glucose-lowering medications affect body composition. We assessed the long-term effects of metformin compared with placebo on whole body bone and body composition measures in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. Methods: This was a sub-study of the Copenhagen Insulin and Metformin Therapy trial, which was a double-blinded randomized placebo-controlled trial assessing 18-month treatment with metformin compared with placebo, in combination with different insulin regimens in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). The sub-study evaluates the effects on bone mineral content (BMC), density (BMD), and body composition from whole body dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) scans which were assessed at baseline and after 18 months. Results: Metformin had a small, but positive, (p < 0.05) effect on subtotal, appendicular, and legs BMC and BMD compared with placebo. After adjustment for sex, age, vitamin D, smoking, BMI, T2DM duration, HbA1c, and insulin dose, the effects on appendicular BMC and BMD persisted (p < 0.05 for both). The changes in appendicular BMC and BMD corresponded approximately to a 0.7% and 0.5% increase in the metformin group and 0.4% and 0.4% decrease in the placebo group, respectively. These effects were mostly driven by an increase in BMC and BMD in the legs and a loss of BMC and BMD in the arms.

It has been more than a year since the outbreak of COVID-19, and it is still the most critical issue of the healthcare system. Discovering effective strategies to treat infected patients is necessary to decrease the mortality rate. This study aimed to determine the effects of nanocurcumin on the severity of symptoms and length of hospital stay (LOS) in COVID-19 patients. Forty-eight COVID-19 patients were randomly assigned into nanocurcumin (n\u00c2\u00a0= 24) and placebo (n\u00c2\u00a0= 24) groups receiving 160 mg/day nanocurcumin or placebo capsules for 6 days. Mean differences of O2 saturation were significantly higher in patients who received nanocurcumin supplements (p\u00c2\u00a0= 0.02). Also, nanocurcumin treatment significantly reduced the scores of domains 3 and 4 and the total score of Wisconsin Upper Respiratory System Survey (WURSS-24), indicating milder symptoms in the treatment group (p\u00c2\u00a0= 0.01, 0.03, and 0.01 respectively).

CBC/differentiate, hs-CRP level and the pulmonary involvement in CT scan were not different between the two groups. As nanocurcumin can be effective in increasing O2 saturation and reducing the severity of symptoms in COVID-19 patients, it could probably be used as a complementary agent to accelerate the recovery of patients.",

Stem cells, including the resident lung mesenchymal stem cells (LMSCs), are critically important for injury repair. Compelling evidence links perinatal vitamin D (VD) deficiency to reactive airway disease; however, the effects of perinatal VD deficiency on LMSC function is unknown. We tested the hypothesis that perinatal VD deficiency alters LMSC proliferation, differentiation, and function, leading to an enhanced myogenic phenotype. We also determined whether LMSCs' effects on alveolar type II (ATII) cell function are paracrine. Using an established rat model of perinatal VD deficiency, we studied the effects of four dietary regimens (0, 250, 500, or 1,000 IU/kg cholecalciferol-supplemented groups). At Postnatal Day 21, LMSCs were isolated, and cell proliferation and differentiation (under basal and adipogenic induction conditions) were determined. LMSC paracrine effects on ATII cell proliferation and differentiation were determined by culturing ATII cells in LMSC-conditioned media from different experimental groups. Using flow cytometry, .95% of cells were CD45-ve, .90% were CD901ve, .58% were CD1051ve, and .64% were Stro-11ve, indicating their stem cell phenotype. Compared with the VD-supplemented groups, LMSCs from the VD-deficient group demonstrated suppressed PPARc, but enhanced Wnt signaling, under basal and adipogenic induction conditions. LMSCs from 250 VD- and 500 VD-supplemented groups effectively blocked the effects of perinatal VD deficiency. LMSC-conditioned media from the VD-deficient group inhibited ATII cell proliferation and differentiation compared with those from the 250 VD- and 500 VD-supplemented groups.

Purpose: To compare the anti-inflammatory activity of preoperatively applied eyedrops, as determined by cytokine concentrations in aqueous humor collected during surgery in patients undergoing femtosecond laser\u00e2\u20ac\u201cassisted cataract surgery. Methods: A total of 120 patients undergoing femtosecond laser\u00e2\u20ac\u201cassisted cataract surgery were randomly assigned to four groups of 30 patients each. Groups were administered 0.1% fluorometholone eyedrops, 0.45% ketorolac tromethamine eyedrops, both 0.1% fluorometholone and 0.45% ketorolac tromethamine eyedrops, or no eyedrops.

Recent studies of Se supplementation on the effect of Hashimoto\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s thyroiditis (HT) have been reported, but the exact benefit is unclear as well as the underlying immunologic mechanism. We aimed to evaluate the clinical effect of Se supplement in patients with HT, and explore the potential mechanism against thyroid autoimmunity. A prospective, randomized\u00e2\u20ac\u2018controlled study was performed in patients with HT assigned to two groups. Se-treated group (n\u00c2\u00a0=\u00c2\u00a043) received selenious yeast tablet (SYT) for 6\u00c2\u00a0months, whereas no treatment in control group (n\u00c2\u00a0=\u00c2\u00a047).

Second, thyroid function, urinary iodine, Se, Glutathione peroxidase3 (GPx3), and Selenoprotein P1 (SePP1) levels were measured during the SYT treatment. Meanwhile, regulatory T cells (Tregs) and their subsets activated Tregs (aTregs), resting Tregs, and secreting Tregs, as well as Helios and PD-1 expression on these cells were also detected. The results showed that SYT treatment significantly decreased TPOAb, TGAb, and thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) levels, accompanied with the increased Se, GPx3, and SePP1, compared with the control group. Subgroup analysis revealed that subclinical HT may benefit more from this treatment in the decrease of TSH levels by interaction test. Moreover, the percentage of aTregs, Helios/Tregs, and Helios/aTregs were significantly higher in the Se-treated group than control.

Some antihyperglycemic drugs like dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors have shown to prevent diabetic nephropathy. This study endeavors to assess the effect of sitagliptin on proteinuria in Iranian type 2 diabetics. Materials and Methods: A total of 90 type 2 diabetic patients aged between 30 and 80 years with glycated hemoglobin (HbA1C) <8.5 and normotensive under treatment of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers were randomly assigned into two groups. One group received 50 mg sitagliptin per day and the other group received placebo.

The aim of this research was to use \u00ce\u00b2-1,3-glucan (curdlan) as a base for the production of bioactive dressing materials (curdlan/agarose and curdlan/chitosan) that were additionally enriched with vitamin C and/or hydrocortisone to improve healing of chronic and burn wounds.

In this work, it was shown that vitamin C/hydrocortisone-enriched biomaterials exhibited faster vitamin C release profile than hydrocortisone. Consecutive release of the drugs is a desired phenomenon since it protects wounds against accumulation of high and toxic concentrations of the bioactive molecules. Moreover, biomaterials showed gradual release of low doses of the hydrocortisone, which is beneficial during management of burn wounds with hypergranulation tissue. Among all tested variants of biomaterials, dressing materials enriched with hydrocortisone and a mixture of vitamin C/hydrocortisone showed the best therapeutic potential since they had the ability to significantly reduce MMP-2 synthesis by macrophages and increase TGF-\u00ce\u00b21 release by skin cells.

Compared to DPP-4 inhibitors, empagliflozin was associated with similar risk of MI/stroke (HR 0.99 [95% CI 0.81-1.21]), and lower risk of HHF (HR 0.48 [95% CI 0.35-0.67] and 0.63 [95% CI 0.54-0.74], based on a primary and any heart failure discharge diagnosis, respectively). The HR was 0.52 (95% CI 0.38-0.72) for all-cause mortality (ACM) and 0.83 (95% CI 0.70-0.98) for a composite of MI/stroke/ACM. Empagliflozin was associated with a similar risk of LLA and fractures, an increased risk of DKA (HR 1.71 [95% CI 1.08-2.71]) and a decreased risk of AKI (HR 0.60 [95% CI 0.43-0.85]). Conclusions: In clinical practice, the initiation of empagliflozin versus a DPP-4 inhibitor was associated with a lower risk of HHF, ACM and MI/stroke/ACM, a similar risk of MI/stroke, and a safety profile consistent with documented information.",

Intermittent preventive treatment in pregnancy with sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (IPTp-SP) to prevent malaria and adverse birth outcomes is threatened by Plasmodium falciparum resistance to sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine. We investigated the effectiveness of intermittent preventive treatment in pregnancy with monthly dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine (IPTp-DHP) as an alternative option to IPTp-SP. A total of 956 malaria-free (malaria rapid diagnostic test (MRDT) negative) pregnant women from moderate malaria transmission areas in Tanzania were enrolled and randomized to receive monthly IPTp-DHP (n\u00c2\u00a0=\u00c2\u00a0478) or IPTp-SP (n\u00c2\u00a0=\u00c2\u00a0478) and followed for maternal and birth outcomes. The primary outcome was the prevalence of histopathologically confirmed placental malaria (active or past infection). Secondary outcomes were overall malaria at delivery, symptomatic-malaria, parasitemia during pregnancy, and adverse birth outcomes as a composite of spontaneous-abortion, premature birth, stillbirth, and low birth weight (LBW) fetal anemia. Outcome differences between treatment groups were expressed as the protective efficacy (PE), defined as 1-prevalence ratios or 1-incidence rate ratio. The prevalence of histopathologically confirmed placental malaria was significantly lower in IPTp-DHP (2.5%, 12/478) than IPTp-SP (8.2%, 39/478); PE\u00c2\u00a0=\u00c2\u00a069% (95% confidence interval (CI): 42\u00e2\u20ac\u201c84, P\u00c2\u00a0<\u00c2\u00a00.001). The prevalence of maternal malaria at delivery was significantly lower in IPTp-DHP (8.2%) than IPTp-SP (18.2%, P\u00c2\u00a0<\u00c2\u00a00.001).

Introduction: A 6-month isoniazid as tuberculosis preventive therapy (TPT) for people living with HIV (PLHIV) was nationally introduced in Eritrea in 2014. However, its effectiveness in preventing tuberculosis (TB) and duration of protection was questioned by physicians. This study was, therefore, conducted to evaluate the impact of the isoniazid preventive therapy (IPT) primarily on the prevention of TB and duration of its protection in PLHIV. Methods: A retrospective cohort study was conducted that selected all eligible PLHIV attending HIV care clinics in all national and regional referral hospitals in Eritrea. Data was collected from patients\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 clinical cards using a structured data extraction sheet. The association between use of IPT and outcomes of interest was assessed using a Cox proportional hazard regression model and Kaplan\u00e2\u20ac\u201cMeier curve. Results: A total of 6803 patients were selected, which accounted for 75% of all PLHIV-accessing HIV care clinics in Eritrea. About 76% of patients were exposed to IPT while the remaining 24% were unexposed. The mean follow-up time was 4.9\u00c2\u00a0years (SD 1.4). The incidence rate of TB was 1.7 and 10 cases per 1000 person-years in the exposed and unexposed, respectively. The unexposed had a higher risk of incident TB (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR] 3.75, 95% confidence interval [CI] 2.89, 6.13) and all-cause mortality (HR 2.41, 95%\u00c2\u00a0CI 1.85, 3.14) compared to the exposed. A Kaplan\u00e2\u20ac\u201cMeier curve showed that the exposed group had a higher TB-free follow-up probability (98.8%) compared to the unexposed (95%) at 65\u00c2\u00a0months of follow-up (p < 0.001). IPT protection decreased rapidly 6\u00c2\u00a0months after isoniazid completion. Conclusion: Use of a 6-month isoniazid as TPT was found to be effective in reducing incident TB in PLHIV-accessing HIV care clinics in Eritrea.

Background: Novel Corona Virus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) can affect multiple organs, including the lungs, resulting in pneumonia. Apart from steroids, other anti-COVID drugs that have been studied appear to have little or no effect on COVID-19 pneumonia. There is a well-known history of inflammatory disease, including pneumonia, treated with low-dose radiation therapy (LDRT). It reduces the production of proinflammatory cytokines, Interleukin-1a (IL-1a), and leukocyte recruitment. Methods: A comprehensive literature search was conducted using PubMed, Scopus, Embase, CINAHL, and Google Scholar, with keywords such as 'radiotherapy,' 'low-dose radiation therapy,' 'low-dose irradiation,' 'covid-19 pneumonia,' 'SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia,' and 'covid pneumonia.' with additional filters for human studies and customized articles in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses. We reviewed randomized controlled trials, quasi-experimental studies, cohort, case-control, and cross-sectional studies with a clearly defined intervention, including low-dose radiotherapy alone or in combination with any therapy to treat COVID-19 pneumonia from December 2019 to May 2021. Patients receiving standard or high-dose radiotherapy, including for other diseases, were excluded. Zotero software was used to collect and organize research from various databases, remove duplicates, extract relevant data, and record decisions. Participants' demographics and baseline status were obtained from the full-text articles along with the intervention's outcome/effect on patient status. Results: Four studies with 61 participants that met the inclusion criteria were included. One was a double-blind randomized controlled trial, one a non-randomized trial, while the other two were single-arm clinical trials. Low-dose radiation therapy did not show any significant improvement in COVID-19 patients.

However, little is known about the efficacy of PMX-DHP in the Korean population. The aim of this study was to examine the effectiveness of PMX-DHP in AE of IP. Methods: We conducted a retrospective study of 12 patients with AE of IP, including two patients with AE of IPF, who were treated with PMX-DHP at our center. Treatment with PMX-DHP was carried out once or twice. We collected and analyzed data on changes in oxygenation with PMX-DHP and survival after AE. Results: In patients with AE of IP, the ratio of partial pressure of arterial oxygen to the fraction of inspired oxygen, or the P/F ratio, had significantly improved at the end of the treatment with PMX-DHP (87.0 [80.3 - 130.9] to 200.6 [105.0 - 245.5] mmHg, p = 0.019).

Purpose: At diagnosis and throughout the disease course, patients with high-grade glioma (HGG) experience a diminished quality of life (QOL) and increased fatigue. Naltrexone, an orally semisynthetic opiate antagonist, is FDA-approved for the treatment of heroin/alcohol addiction, and low-dose naltrexone (LDN) has been observed to improve QOL and lower fatigue in other neurological illnesses, such as multiple sclerosis. LDN is believed to function as a partial agonist and can lead to shifts in neurochemicals that reduce fatigue. Based on this, we sought to study whether LDN has an impact on QOL and fatigue in patients with HGG. Methods: In a placebo-controlled, double-blind study, we randomized 110 HGG patients to receive placebo (N = 56) or LDN 4.5\u00c2\u00a0mg orally at night (N = 54). Subjects received LDN or placebo at day 1 of concurrent radiation and temozolomide therapy and continued for 16\u00c2\u00a0weeks.

QOL and fatigue changes between baseline and post concurrent chemotherapy and radiation therapy were not significantly different between patients receiving LDN or placebo. The adverse event profiles for LDN and placebo were similar and attributed to concomitant use of temozolomide. Conclusions: LDN has no effect on QOL and fatigue in HGG patients during concurrent chemotherapy and radiation therapy.

Importance: There is clinical equipoise for COVID-19 convalescent plasma (CCP) use in patients hospitalized with COVID-19. Objective: To determine the safety and efficacy of CCP compared with placebo in hospitalized patients with COVID-19 receiving noninvasive supplemental oxygen. Design, Setting, and Participants: CONTAIN COVID-19, a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of CCP in hospitalized adults with COVID-19, was conducted at 21 US hospitals from April 17, 2020, to March 15, 2021. The trial enrolled 941 participants who were hospitalized for 3 or less days or presented 7 or less days after symptom onset and required noninvasive oxygen supplementation. Interventions: A unit of approximately 250 mL of CCP or equivalent volume of placebo (normal saline). Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary outcome was participant scores on the 11-point World Health Organization (WHO) Ordinal Scale for Clinical Improvement on day 14 after randomization; the secondary outcome was WHO scores determined on day 28. Subgroups were analyzed with respect to age, baseline WHO score, concomitant medications, symptom duration, CCP SARS-CoV-2 titer, baseline SARS-CoV-2 serostatus, and enrollment quarter. Outcomes were analyzed using a bayesian proportional cumulative odds model. Efficacy of CCP was defined as a cumulative adjusted odds ratio (cOR) less than 1 and a clinically meaningful effect as cOR less than 0.8. Results: Of 941 participants randomized (473 to placebo and 468 to CCP), 556 were men (59.1%); median age was 63 years (IQR, 52-73); 373 (39.6%) were Hispanic and 132 (14.0%) were non-Hispanic Black.

Introduction: This double-blind, parallel-group, active-controlled phase III trial (NCT02260804) assessed CT-P10 and rituximab safety and efficacy in patients with previously untreated low-tumor-burden follicular lymphoma (LTBFL), including after a single switch from rituximab to CT-P10. Patients and Methods: LTBFL patients were randomized (1:1) to receive CT-P10 or rituximab (375 mg/m2 intravenously; day 1 of 4 7-day cycles). Patients achieving disease control entered a 2-year maintenance period. CT-P10 or rituximab were administered every 8 weeks (6 cycles) in year 1; all patients could receive CT-P10 (every 8 weeks; 6 cycles) in year 2. Secondary endpoints (reported here) were overall response rate (ORR) during the study period, progression-free survival (PFS), time to progression (TTP), and overall survival (OS). Safety and immunogenicity were evaluated. Results: Between November 9, 2015 and January 4, 2018, 258 patients were randomized (130 for CT-P10; 128 for rituximab).

Background: Liver disease is associated with increased bleeding risk.

Methods: Electronic databases (PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane Library) were searched to retrieve studies on the efficacy and safety of DOACs versus warfarin in AF patients with liver disease from January 1980 to April 2020. A meta-analysis was conducted using a random-effects model. Results: Six studies involving 41,859 patients were included. Compared with warfarin, DOACs demonstrated significant reduction in ischemic stroke (HR, 0.68; 95% CI (0.54\u00e2\u20ac\u201c0.86)), major bleeding (0.74 (0.59\u00e2\u20ac\u201c0.92)), and intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) (0.48 (0.40\u00e2\u20ac\u201c0.58)), with no significant effect on gastrointestinal bleeding (P = 0.893) in AF patients with liver disease. Similar results were observed in regular-dose, reduced-dose, and active liver disease subgroups, albeit Asian patients had a slight reduction in major bleeding (P = 0.055).

Introduction: Many immunomodulators have been studied in clinical trials for the treatment of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). However, data identifying the most effective and safest treatment are lacking. We conducted a systematic review and network meta-analysis to rank immunomodulators in the treatment of COVID-19 according to their efficacy and safety. Methods: Published and peer-reviewed randomized controlled trials assessing the efficacy of immunomodulators in hospitalized patients with COVID-19 were searched up to June\u00c2\u00a030, 2021. Direct and network meta-analyses were applied to assess the outcomes. The probability of efficacy and safety was estimated, and the drugs were awarded a numerical ranking. Results: Twenty-six studies were eligible. Compared with standard of care, dexamethasone and tocilizumab had significantly lower mortality rates with pooled risk ratios (RRs) of 0.91 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.84\u00e2\u20ac\u201c0.99) and 0.88 (95%\u00c2\u00a0CI 0.82\u00e2\u20ac\u201c0.96), respectively. Meanwhile, the most effective corticosteroid, interleukin-6 antagonist, and Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitor were hydrocortisone, sarilumab, and ruxolitinib, respectively. However, when superimposed infection was considered, ruxolitinib was the best treatment followed by baricitinib. Moreover, methylprednisolone had the worst combined efficacy and safety among the examined treatments. Conclusions: Overall, immunomodulators were more effective than standard of care. Important differences exist among immunomodulators regarding both efficacy and safety in favor of ruxolitinib and baricitinib. Further well-conducted randomized controlled trials should focus on JAK inhibitors. Methylprednisolone use should be discouraged because of its poor efficacy and high risk of superimposed infection.

Introduction: We aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of intrathecal pemetrexed (IP) for treating EGFR-mutant leptomeningeal metastases (LMs) from EGFR-mutant NSCLC. Methods: Patients with EGFR-mutant NSCLC with LM who had failed tyrosine kinase inhibitors were recruited. The dose of IP was escalated from 15 mg to 80 mg using an accelerated titration design in a phase 1 study. The recommended dose (RD) determined in phase 1 was used in the phase 2 study. The primary end point was treatment efficacy measured as the clinical response rate. Overall survival and adverse events (AEs) were evaluated as secondary end points. Results: The RD observed in the phase 1 study was 50 mg pemetrexed. A total of 30 cases of LM-NSCLC were enrolled in the phase 2 study, including 14 males and 16 females. Four patients did not survive for 4 weeks and could not be evaluated for efficacy. The clinical response rate was 84.6% (22 of 26).

Safety was assessed based on adverse events (AEs) and standard clinical laboratory tests. Efficacy endpoints of clinical response at ECR and PTE were analyzed for the mITT and clinically evaluable (CE) PTE populations. Results: In total, 1380 patients (822 PWID, 558 non-PWID) were included in this secondary analysis. Wound infections were reported more frequently in the PWID subgroup (72.8%) at baseline; cellulitis or erysipelas (43.9%) and major abscess (37.4%) were the most frequently reported baseline infections in the non-PWID subgroup.

Purpose: We aimed to assess onabotulinumtoxinA treatment outcomes by sex in patients with overactive bladder (OAB) and then explore the impact of serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels in men. Methods: Patients inadequately managed with OAB medications were randomized to receive single-dose onabotulinumtoxinA (100 U) or placebo intravesical injection in a phase III trial in Japan. We performed subgroup analyses by sex and post-hoc subgroup analyses using male PSA categories. Results: In women (n = 186), onabotulinumtoxinA demonstrated statistically significant and clinically relevant improvements in all urinary symptoms at Week 12. In men with lower PSA (< 1.5\u00c2\u00a0ng/mL, n = 40), onabotulinumtoxinA also showed numerically greater reductions in urinary symptom frequency than placebo; the between-group differences (onabotulinumtoxinA minus placebo) in change from baseline in the average daily number at Week 12 for urinary incontinence (UI), urgency UI, micturition, urgency, and nocturia were \u00e2\u02c6\u2019 1.43, \u00e2\u02c6\u2019 1.79, \u00e2\u02c6\u2019 2.81, \u00e2\u02c6\u2019 2.45, and \u00e2\u02c6\u2019 0.32 episodes, respectively. In men with higher PSA (\u00e2\u2030\u00a5 1.5\u00c2\u00a0ng/mL, n = 22), onabotulinumtoxinA did not reduce urinary symptom frequency.

Objective: To investigate how to use polymyxin B rationally in order to produce the best efficacy and safety in patients with carbapenem-resistant gram-negative organisms (CRO) infection. Methods: The clinical characteristics and microbiological results of 181 patients caused by CRO infection treated with polymyxin B in the First Affiliated Hospital from July 2018 to May 2020 were retrospectively analyzed. The bacterial clearance rate, clinical efficacy, adverse drug reactions and 28\u00c2\u00a0days mortality were evaluated. Results: The overall effective rate of 181 patients was 49.72%, the total bacterial clearance rate was 42.0%, and the 28\u00c2\u00a0day all-cause mortality rate was 59.1%. The effective rate and bacterial clearance rate in the group of less than 24\u00c2\u00a0h from the isolation of CRO to the use of polymyxin B were significantly higher than those in the group of more than 24\u00c2\u00a0h. Logistics multivariate regression analysis showed that the predictive factors for effective treatment of CRO with polymyxin B were APACHEII score, duration of polymyxin B treatment, combination of polymyxin B and other antibiotics, and bacterial clearance. 17 cases (9.36%) of acute kidney injury were considered as polymyxin B nephrotoxicity and 4 cases (23.5%) recovered after polymyxin B withdrawal.

The human anthrax vaccine is mainly composed of the anthrax protective antigen (PA). Considerable efforts are being directed towards improving the efficacy of vaccines because the use of commercial anthrax vaccines (human/veterinary) is associated with several limitations. Objective: In this study, a triple chimeric antigen referred to as ELP (gene accession no: MT590758) comprising highly immunogenic domains of PA, LF, and EF was designed, constructed, and assessed for the immunization capacity against anthrax in a guinea pig model.

The bactericidal and synergistic activity of fosfomycin plus amikacin and gentamicin was studied trough time\u00e2\u20ac\u201ckill assays against four clonally unrelated clinical isolates of carbapenemase-producing K. pneumoniae, VIM-1, VIM-1 plus DHA-1, OXA-48 plus CTXM-15, and KPC-3, respectively. The efficacy of antimicrobials that showed synergistic activity in vitro against all the carbapenemase-producing K. pneumoniae were tested in monotherapy and in combination, in a murine peritoneal sepsis model. In vitro, fosfomycin plus amikacin showed synergistic and bactericidal effect against strains producing VIM-1, VIM-1 plus DHA-1, and OXA-48 plus CTX-M-15. Fosfomycin plus gentamicin had in vitro synergistic activity against the strain producing KPC-3. In vivo, fosfomycin and amikacin and its combination reduced the spleen bacterial concentration compared with controls groups in animals infected by K. pneumoniae producing VIM-1 and OXA-48 plus CTX-M-15. Moreover, amikacin alone and its combination with fosfomycin reduced the bacteremia rate against the VIM-1 producer strain. Contrary to the in vitro results, no in vivo efficacy was found with fosfomycin plus amikacin against the VIM-1 plus DHA-1 producer strain. Finally, fosfomycin plus gentamicin reduced the bacterial concentration in spleen against the KPC-3 producer strain. In conclusion, our results suggest that fosfomycin plus aminoglycosides has a dissimilar efficacy in the treatment of this severe experimental infection, when caused by different carbapenemase-producing K. pneumoniae strains.

Risankizumab specifically inhibits interleukin 23 and has demonstrated superior efficacy in active-comparator studies in patients with moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis. We compared the efficacy of risankizumab with that of secukinumab across patient subgroups. Methods: Subgroup analyses using data from the phase 3 IMMerge study (NCT03478787) were performed. Efficacy in adults with moderate-to-severe psoriasis treated with risankizumab 150\u00c2\u00a0mg and secukinumab 300\u00c2\u00a0mg was assessed as the proportion of patients who achieved \u00e2\u2030\u00a5 90% improvement in Psoriasis Area Severity Index (PASI\u00c2\u00a090) at week\u00c2\u00a052 across demographics and disease characteristics.

Liposomes, as vehicles alone or in combination with rifampicin (RIF) microparticles (RMs), were evaluated as vehicles to enhance the permeation of RIF into granulomas. RIF liposomes (RLs) were extruded through a 0.1 \u00c2\u00b5m polypropylene membrane. RMs were prepared by the solvent evaporation method. Four weeks after infection, guinea pigs (GPs) were assigned to groups treated with a combination of RM-RLs or RLs alone. RLs were nebulized after extrusion whereas RMs were suspended in saline and nebulized to GPs in a nose-only inhalation chamber. Necropsy was performed after the treatment; the lungs and spleen were resected for bacteriology. RLs had mean diameters of 137.1 \u00c2\u00b1 33.7 nm whereas RMs had a projected area diameter of 2.48 \u00c2\u00b5m.

Goal: The aim of this study was to assess the efficacy of probiotic i3.1 in improving lactose intolerance symptoms compared with placebo after 8 weeks of treatment. Background: Probiotics are promising strategies to prevent and improve lactose intolerance symptoms, but previous studies have provided conflicting results. Materials and Methods: This randomized, prospective, placebo-controlled study was conducted at the Hospital Ju\u00c3\u00a1rez de M\u00c3\u00a9xico.

BACKGROUND: Physical exercise is an intervention that might protect against doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity. In this meta-analysis and systematic review, we aimed to estimate the effect of exercise on doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity and to evaluate mechanisms underlying exercise-mediated cardioprotection using (pre)clinical evidence. METHODS AND RESULTS: We conducted a systematic search in PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) databases. Cochrane\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s and Systematic Review Centre for Laboratory Animal Experimentation (SYRCLE) risk-of-bias tools were used to assess the validity of human and animal studies, respectively. Cardiotoxicity outcomes reported by \u00e2\u2030\u00a53 studies were pooled and structured around the type of exercise intervention. Forty articles were included, of which 3 were clinical studies. Overall, in humans (sample sizes ranging from 24 to 61), results were indicative of exercise-mediated cardioprotection, yet they were not sufficient to establish whether physical exercise protects against doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity. In animal studies (n=37), a pooled analysis demonstrated that forced exercise interventions significantly mitigated in vivo and ex vivo doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity compared with nonexercised controls. Similar yet slightly smaller effects were found for voluntary exercise interventions. We identified oxidative stress and related pathways, and less doxorubicin accumulation as mechanisms underlying exercise-induced cardioprotection, of which the latter could act as an overarching mechanism. CONCLUSIONS: Animal studies indicate that various exercise interventions can protect against doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity in rodents. Less doxorubicin accumulation in cardiac tissue could be a key underlying mechanism. Given the preclinical evidence and limited availability of clinical data, larger and methodologically rigorous clinical studies are needed to clarify the role of physical exercise in preventing cardiotoxicity in patients with cancer.",

Application of tranexamic acid (TXA) in the treatment of acetabular fractures could reduce intraoperative and postoperative blood loss. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effect of single and repeated intravenous infusion of TXA on blood loss of acetabular fractures. METHODS: 120 patients with acetabular fractures admitted to our hospital from January 2017 to September 2020 were retrospectively divided into three groups: Patients accepted 1g TXA at preoperative 30 minutes were defined as single TXA group (n=40); Patients accepted 1g TXA at preoperative 30 minutes and 1g TXA at 3 hours after the start of surgery were defined as repeated TXA group (n=40); Patients accepted normal saline at preoperative 30 minutes were defined as control group (n=40). RESULTS: The total blood loss in single TXA group and repeated TXA group were significantly lower than control group, and the total blood loss in the repeated TXA group was significantly lower than single TXA group (P<0.05). The hidden blood loss from surgery to postoperative 1 day in repeated TXA group was significantly lower than single TXA group and the control group(P<0.05). No significant differences were observed in the operative time, postoperative transfusion rate and thrombosis rate among the three groups (P> 0.05).

Background-Aim: Intravenously administered biologicals are associated with a huge pressure to Infusion Units and increased cost. We aimed to assess the impact of switching infliximab to golimumab in ulcerative colitis (UC) patients in deep remission. Patients and method: In a prospective, single-centre pilot study UC patients on infliximab mono-therapy for \u00e2\u2030\u00a5 2 years, whowere in deep remission, consented to switch to golimumab and were followed for 1 year with clinical assessment, serum and faecal biomarkers, work productivity, satisfaction with treatment and quality of life parameters. Endoscopic remission was assessed by colonoscopy at 1 year. Patients fulfilling the same inclusion criteria, who did not consent to switch to golimumab and continued to receive infliximab mono-therapy, for the same period, served as controls. Results: Between October 2015 and October 2017, 20 patients were recruited; however one patient stopped therapy because of pregnancy. All 19 patients who were switched to golimumab were still in clinical, biomarker and endoscopic remission at 1 year and maintained excellent quality of life without any complications. In the control group, 18 of 19 patients were also in deep remission, since only one patient had a flare which was managed with IFX dose intensification. During a median 3 years extension treatment with golimumab only 2 patients experienced a flare of colitis. Conclusions: This pilot study indicates that switching from in-fliximab to golimumab in UC patients in deep remission does not compromise treatment effectiveness or the course of disease; golimumab offers a valid alternative to intravenous infliximab infusions during the COVID-19 pandemic.

However, its efficacy has not yet been evaluated in a randomized controlled trial. We aimed to compare the effectiveness and safety of JXZDF and aripiprazole in patients with TD. Methods: In this randomized, double-blind, double-dummy, parallel controlled trial, 120 patients with TD, aged 6\u00e2\u20ac\u201c16 years were randomly assigned to receive either JXZDF (n = 60, 17.6 g/day) or aripiprazole (n = 60, 10 mg/day) for 12 weeks. The primary outcome was measured using the Yale Global Tic Severity Scale (YGTSS). Adverse events were assessed using the Treatment Emergent Symptom Scale. Results: JXZDF produced greater improvements than aripiprazole in the following YGTSS subscale scores at the endpoint: total tic scores (P = 0.004, 95% CI: 1.085\u00e2\u20ac\u201c3.494) and total motor scores (P = 0.004, 95% CI: 0.313\u00e2\u20ac\u201c1.739).

Objective: This phase III study aimed to evaluate the efficacy, safety, and immunogenicity of HLX04 compared with reference bevacizumab in combination with XELOX or mFOLFOX6 as first-line treatment for recurrent/metastatic colorectal cancer (CRC). Methods: In this double-blind, parallel-group study, patients were randomized 1:1 to receive HLX04 or bevacizumab (7.5 mg/kg every 3 weeks when combined with XELOX; 5 mg/kg every 2 weeks when combined with mFOLFOX6). The primary endpoint was progression-free survival rate at week 36 (PFSR36w) per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST v1.1). Prespecified equivalence margins of PFSR36w were set as \u00e2\u02c6\u2019 11 to 15% (rate difference) and 0.8 to 1.25 (rate ratio).

Background: Empagliflozin is a selective sodium\u00e2\u20ac\u201cglucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitor used to lower blood sugar in adults with type 2 diabetes. Empagliflozin also exerts cardioprotective effects independent from glucose control, but its benefits on arrhythmogenesis and sudden cardiac death are not known. The purpose of this study was to examine the effect of empagliflozin on myocardial ischemia/reperfusion-provoked cardiac arrhythmia and sudden cardiac death in vivo. Methods: Male Sprague Dawley rats were randomly assigned to sham-operated, control or empagliflozin groups. All except for the sham-operated rats were subjected to 5-min left main coronary artery ligation followed by 20-min reperfusion. A standard limb lead II electrocardiogram was continuously measured throughout the experiment. Coronary artery reperfusion-induced ventricular arrhythmogenesis and empagliflozin therapy were evaluated. The hearts were used for protein phosphorylation analysis and immunohistological assessment. Results: Empagliflozin did not alter baseline cardiac normal conduction activity. However, empagliflozin eliminated myocardial vulnerability to sudden cardiac death (from 69.2% mortality rate in the control group to 0% in the empagliflozin group) and reduced the susceptibility to reperfusion-induced arrhythmias post I/R injury. Empagliflozin increased phosphorylation of cardiac ERK1/2 after reperfusion injury. Furthermore, inhibition of ERK1/2 using U0126 abolished the anti-arrhythmic action of empagliflozin and ERK1/2 phosphorylation. Conclusions: Pretreatment with empagliflozin protects the heart from subsequent severe lethal ventricular arrhythmia induced by myocardial ischemia and reperfusion injury. These protective benefits may occur as a consequence of activation of the ERK1/2-dependent cell-survival signaling pathway in a glucose-independent manner.",

Objectives: The chief objective of the present research was to reduce local side effects by reducing the dose, controlling the release, and improving the stability by developing and optimizing tretinoin (TRT)-loaded topical emulgel formulation. Methods: TRT emulgel (TE) was prepared and optimized at varying ratios of excipients and using 32 optimal response surface design (ORSD). The TRT emulgel was optimized based on TRT content and in vitro release profile of TRT from formulated emulgel batches. The optimized TRT was characterized for physical properties, pH, viscosity, spreadability, extrudability, photomicroscopy, in vitro anti-acne, in vivo skin irritation, in vivo anti-inflammatory activity, and stability study. Results: The FTIR and DSC analysis revealed the compatibility between TRT and formulation excipients of emulgel. The batch F5 of emulgel formulation displayed maximum drug content (98.69 \u00c2\u00b1 1.26%), and controlled TRT release (78.27 \u00c2\u00b1 0.69%).

Eprosartan (EPRO), an angiotensin receptor type-1 (AT-1) blocker, exhibited neuroprotective activities in ischemic stroke resulting from focal cerebral ischemia in rats. The current study aimed to clarify the neuroprotective role of EPRO in middle carotid artery occlusion (MCAO)-induced ischemic stroke in rats. Fifty-six male Wistar rats were divided into four groups (n = 14 per group): sham-operated group, sham receiving EPRO (60 mg/kg/day, po) group, ischemia\u00e2\u20ac\u201creperfusion (IR) group, and IR receiving EPRO (60 mg/kg/day, po) group. MCAO led to a remarkable impairment in motor function together with stimulation of inflammatory and apoptotic pathways in the hippocampus of rats. After MCAO, the AT1 receptor in the brain was stimulated, resulting in activation of Janus kinase 2/signal transducers and activators of transcription 3 signaling generating more neuroinflammatory milieu and destructive actions on the hippocampus. Augmentation of caspase-3 level by MCAO enhanced neuronal apoptosis synchronized with neurodegenerative effects of oxidative stress biomarkers. Pretreatment with EPRO opposed motor impairment and decreased oxidative and apoptotic mediators in the hippocampus of rats. The anti-inflammatory activity of EPRO was revealed by downregulation of nuclear factor-kappa B and tumor necrosis factor-\u00ce\u00b2 levels and (C\u00e2\u20ac\u201cX\u00e2\u20ac\u201cC motif) ligand 1 messenger RNA (mRNA) expression.

The objective of this study was to investigate the impact of eptinezumab, a preventive migraine treatment, on patient-reported headache impact, acute medication optimization, and perception of disease change when initiated during a migraine attack. Methods: RELIEF was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial conducted between 2019 and 2020 in adults with \u00e2\u2030\u00a51-year history of migraine and 4\u00e2\u20ac\u201c15 migraine days per month in the 3 months prior to screening. Patients were randomized (1:1) to a 30-min infusion of eptinezumab 100 mg or placebo within 1\u00e2\u20ac\u201c6 h of a qualifying migraine attack onset.

A post hoc analysis of these measures was conducted in patients who reported headache pain freedom at 2 h after infusion start. Results: Of 480 patients enrolled and treated, 476 completed the study and are included in this analysis. Mean baseline HIT-6 total scores indicated severe headache impact (eptinezumab, 65.1; placebo, 64.8). At week 4, the eptinezumab-treated group demonstrated clinically meaningful improvement in HIT-6 total score compared with placebo (mean change from baseline: eptinezumab, \u00e2\u02c6\u2019 8.7; placebo, \u00e2\u02c6\u2019 4.5; mean [95% CI] difference from placebo: \u00e2\u02c6\u2019 4.2 [\u00e2\u02c6\u2019 5.75, \u00e2\u02c6\u2019 2.63], P <.0001), with greater reductions in each item score vs placebo (P <.001 all comparisons).

Focused ultrasound sonication was performed after intravenous injection of microbubbles. Microbubble cavitation activity, the fundamental physical mechanism underlying focused ultrasound BBB opening, was monitored with passive cavitation detection. After sonication, contrast-enhanced T1-weighted MRI was performed to assess BBB opening outcome. Intravenously injected Evans blue was used as a model agent to evaluate trans-BBB delivery efficiency. Results: The microbubble cavitation dose decreased by an average of 2.1 dB at 1.5 T (P = .05), 2.9 dB at 3.0 T (P = .01), and 3.0 dB at 4.7 T (P = .01) compared with that outside the magnetic field (approximately 0 T). The static magnetic field of an MRI scanner decreased BBB opening volume in mice by 3.2-fold at 1.5 T (P <001), 4.5-fold at 3.0 T (P <.001), and 11.6-fold at 4.7 T (P <.001) compared with mice treated outside the magnetic field. It also decreased Evans blue trans-BBB delivery 1.4-fold at 1.5 T (P = .009), 1.6-fold at 3.0 T (P <.001), and 1.9-fold at 4.7 T (P <.001).

Background: Individuals who experience an initial episode of invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD) are at increased risk of recurrent episodes. However, the magnitude of risk has not been well-quantified in the pneumococcal conjugate vaccine era. Individuals with a previous episode of IPD are not commonly identified as a high-risk group in vaccination guidelines. Methods: Australian residents with at least one case of IPD between 1991 and 2016 were identified using routine public health surveillance data which included identified IPD risk factors. Incidence of recurrent IPD was calculated from 2001 onwards (after IPD became nationally notifiable) using time-to-event analyses with individuals contributing person-time at risk of recurrence if they survived greater than 14 days after initial episode onset. Results: From 1991 to 2016 there were 28,809 IPD episodes in 28,218 individuals. A total of 512 (1.8%) persons experienced 591 recurrent episodes. From 2001 to 2016 the incidence of recurrent IPD was 216.2 per 100,000 person-years, 27 times greater than the population rate of primary IPD during this period (8.0 per 100,000 population per year). Between 2011 and 2016, more than one-quarter of individuals experiencing recurrence had no IPD risk factors identified at first episode. Conclusions: There is substantially increased risk of recurrent IPD after an initial episode. At least one-quarter of those with recurrent episodes have no identified risk factors at the initial episode. Given the potential preventability of future episodes, those with a previous IPD episode should be identified as a high-risk group and receive pneumococcal vaccination.",

Treatment of osteoporosis in systemic lupus erythematosus should not be based on fracture risk estimation alone. Relevant time-dependent risk factors should be taken into account for an individualized decision. Objective: To compare the observed fracture incidence in a 10-year longitudinal cohort of patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) with the fracture risk prediction from the fracture risk assessment (FRAX) tool. Methods: Adult patients (\u00e2\u00a9\u00be40 years) with SLE who had a first DEXA scan performed in 2005\u00e2\u20ac\u201c2009 were studied. The 10-year rates of major osteoporotic and hip fractures were estimated by FRAX using clinical data at DEXA with adjustment for prednisolone dosage. The actual incidence of clinical fractures at 10 years was compared with the estimated rates. Factors associated with new fractures were studied by logistic regression. Results: A total of 229 SLE patients were studied (age: 50.2 \u00c2\u00b1 6.6 years, 93% women).

Background: Dysregulated lipid metabolism is emerging as a hallmark in several malignancies, including ovarian cancer (OC). Specifically, metastatic OC is highly dependent on lipid-rich omentum. We aimed to investigate the therapeutic value of targeting lipid metabolism in OC. For this purpose, we studied the role of PCSK9, a cholesterol-regulating enzyme, in OC cell survival and its downstream signaling. We also investigated the cytotoxic efficacy of a small library of metabolic (n = 11) and mTOR (n = 10) inhibitors using OC cell lines (n = 8) and ex vivo patient-derived cell cultures (PDCs, n = 5) to identify clinically suitable drug vulnerabilities. Targeting PCSK9 expression with siRNA or PCSK9 specific inhibitor (PF-06446846) impaired OC cell survival. In addi-tion, overexpression of PCSK9 induced robust AKT phosphorylation along with increased expression of ERK1/2 and MEK1/2, suggesting a pro-survival role of PCSK9 in OC cells. Moreover, our drug testing revealed marked differences in cytotoxic responses to drugs targeting metabolic pathways of high-grade serous ovarian cancer (HGSOC) and low-grade serous ovarian cancer (LGSOC) PDCs. Our results show that targeting PCSK9 expression could impair OC cell survival, which warrants further investigation to address the dependency of this cancer on lipogenesis and omental metastasis.

This study aimed to evaluate the pharmacokinetic parameters of parenteral phenobarbital in critically ill patients with brain injury. Patients with severe traumatic or non-traumatic brain injury at high risk of seizure were included and followed for seven days. All patients initially received phenobarbital as a loading dose of 15 mg/kg over 30-minutes infusion, followed by 2 mg/kg/day divided into three doses.

Abstract: Background: Emergency front of neck access (eFONA) is a critical step in oxygenation in cases of unrelieved airway obstruction. Multiple techniques are used in clinical practice without agreement regarding the optimal approach. We evaluated a novel device, the Cric-Guide (CG), a channelled bougie introducer that enters the airway in a single action and compared it with a scalpel-bougie-tube (SBT) technique in laboratory benchtop model. Methods: Seven anaesthesiologists attempted eFONA on both obese and non-obese models using both techniques in randomized order on an excised porcine trachea with an intact larynx with variable subcutaneous tissue depth. The primary outcome was successful tracheal cannulation. Secondary outcomes included false passage rate, time and tissue injury. Results: Anaesthesiologists performed 4 cricothyroidotomies on each model with each device. The CG was more successful in airway cannulation (47/56 [89.4%] vs. 33/56 [58.9%], P\u00c2\u00a0=\u00c2\u00a00.007). This difference was observed in the obese model only.

There were no significant differences in time to completion or injury patterns between the techniques in the obese model, but the SBT was faster in the non-obese model.

Using more than 28 tablets increased the risk of fluorescence in hair and the T-zone by 5.92 (2.43\u00e2\u20ac\u201c14.71) and 2.88 (1.11\u00e2\u20ac\u201c7.47) times, respectively. No relationship was found between the fluorescence intensity in any localization and the total dose. However, we determined a negative correlation between the elapsed time after the last dose and the fluorescence intensity in the lunulae and the T-zone (p=0.036; p=0.031; respectively). It was noted that BMI negatively correlated with the fluorescence intensity in the lunulae (p=0.001). Skin type was related to intensity for all localizations (p<0.001). Fluorescence was found in the lunulae with significantly less frequency in patients using N-acetylcysteine (p=0.040). Conclusions: We must be aware of favipiravir-induced phototoxicity.",

Background: Strategies for sequencing disease modifying therapies (DMTs) in multiple sclerosis (MS) patients include escalation, high efficacy early, induction, and de-escalation. Objective: To provide a perspective on de-escalation, which aims to match the ratio of DMT benefit/risk in aging patients. Methods: We reanalyzed data from a retrospective, real-world cohort of MS patients to model disease activity for oral (dimethyl fumarate and fingolimod) and higher efficacy infusible (natalizumab and rituximab) DMTs by age. For patients with relapsing MS, we conducted a controlled, stratified analysis examining odds of disease activity for oral vs. infusible DMTs in patients <45 or \u00e2\u2030\u00a545 years. We reviewed the literature to identify DMT risks and predictors of safe discontinuation. Results: Younger patients had lower probability of disease activity on infusible vs. oral DMTs. There was no statistical difference after age 54.2 years. When dichotomized, patients <45 years on oral DMTs had greater odds of disease activity compared to patients on infusible DMTs, while among those \u00e2\u2030\u00a545 years, there was no difference. Literature review noted that adverse events increase with aging, notably infections in patients with higher disability and longer DMT duration. Additionally, we identified factors predictive of disease reactivation including age, clinical stability, and MRI activity. Conclusion: In a real-world cohort of relapsing MS patients, high efficacy DMTs had less benefit with aging but were associated with increased risks. This cohort helps overcome some limitations of trials where older patients were excluded. To better balance benefits/risks, we propose a DMT de-escalation approach for aging MS patients.",

Background: Targeted radionuclide therapy with Actinium-225-labeled prostate-specific membrane antigen ligands (225Ac-PSMA) has emerged as a promising treatment modality in the management of metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC). With its high linear energy transfer and short path length, 225Ac induces double-stranded DNA breaks and is expected to have excellent efficacy and safety profile. This systematic review was conducted to precisely evaluate the role of 225Ac-PSMA radioligand therapy (RLT) in mCRPC. Methods: This systematic review followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. Searches were made using relevant keywords in the PubMed, Embase, and Scopus databases, and articles up to December 2020 were included. Data on efficacy and toxicity were extracted from the individual articles. Random-effects model was used for generating pooled estimates through meta-analysis. Results: Ten articles comprising 256 patients were included. Overall, 62.8% (95% confidence interval, CI: 53.4\u00e2\u20ac\u201c71.7%) of the patients treated with 225Ac-PSMA RLT achieved biochemical response, i.e., \u00e2\u2030\u00a550% decline in the serum prostate-specific antigen levels from baseline. Molecular response on Gallium-68 PSMA positron emission tomography/computed tomography was noted in 74% (95% CI: 50.1\u00e2\u20ac\u201c92.1%) of the patients. The pooled estimates of median progression-free survival and overall survival were 9.1 months (95% CI: 3.6\u00e2\u20ac\u201c14.5 months) and 12.8 months (95% CI: 4.5\u00e2\u20ac\u201c21.0 months), respectively. The most commonly reported adverse event was xerostomia, which was observed in 72.7% (95% CI: 50.5\u00e2\u20ac\u201c90.1%) of the patients. However, clinically significant toxicity was limited with grade \u00e2\u2030\u00a53 xerostomia, anemia, leucopenia, thrombocytopenia, and nephrotoxicity occurring in 1.2%, 12.3%, 8.3%, 6.3%, and 3.8% of the patients, respectively. Treatment discontinuation due to adverse events was noted in 20/208 patients. Conclusions: 225Ac-PSMA RLT is an efficacious and safe treatment option for patients with mCRPC.

            "premise": "Exosome-mediated miR-7-5p delivery enhances the anticancer effect of Everolimus via blocking MNK/eIF4E axis in non-small cell lung cancer. Everolimus is a kind of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitors. Activated mitogen-activated protein kinase interacting kinases/eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E (MNK/eIF4E) axis plays a crucial role in resistance to Everolimus in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The eIF4E phosphorylation increased by mTOR inhibitors is mainly mediated by MNKs. However, the mechanisms are poorly understood. Recently, extensive reprogramming of miRNA profiles has also been found after long-term mTOR inhibitor exposure. Our previous studies have confirmed that tumor suppressor miR-7-5p is decreased in A549 cells after treatment with Everolimus. Exactly, MNK1 is the target of miR-7-5p. In this study, we investigated the biological functions and potential molecular mechanisms of miR-7-5p in the NSCLC undergoing treatment with Everolimus. We confirmed that Everolimus targeted mTORC1 inducing NSCLC cells to secrete miR-7-5p-loaded exosomes in Rab27A and Rab27B-dependent manners. Loss of intracellular miR-7-5p induced phosphorylation of MNK/eIF4E axis, but a supplement of extra exosomal miR-7-5p could reverse it. Of note, both low expression of miR-7-5p and elevated MNK1 protein were associated with a poor prognosis of NSCLC. Both endogenous miR-7-5p and exo-miR-7-5p enhanced the therapeutic efficacy of Everolimus by inhibiting the proliferation, migration, and metastasis of NSCLC in vitro and in vivo. The combination of miR-7-5p with Everolimus induced apoptosis to exhibit a synergistic anticancer therapeutic efficacy through dual abrogation of MNK/eIF4E and mTOR in NSCLC. In conclusion, Everolimus decreases the intracellular miR-7-5p by releasing of miR-7-5p loaded exosomes from NSCLC cells in Rab27A and Rab27B dependent manners. Either endogenous miR-7-5p or exo-miR-7-5p combined with Everolimus can enhance the anticancer efficacy by targeting MNK/eIF4E axis and mTOR. Besides, both low levels of miR-7-5p and positive expression of MNK1 act as independent poor prognostic biomarkers for NSCLC. Therefore, restoring miR-7-5p carried by exosome may be a promising novel combined therapeutic strategy with Everolimus for NSCLC.",

To establish a rat model of alcoholic kidney injury and detect the expression of TIMP-1/MMP-24 in the kidneys of rats with alcoholic kidney injury at the molecular pathological level, so as to explore the mechanism of alcohol abuse leading to kidney injury and renal interstitial fibrosis as well as the alleviation of alcohol-induced kidney injury and inhibition of renal interstitial fibrosis by dapagliflozin. Methods. 48 male rats were randomly divided into 4 groups: control group, alcohol group, alcohol + dapagliflozin group, and alcohol + losartan group, each with 12 rats. Different drugs were administered by gavage for modeling and treatment. Six days later, the rats were sacrificed, blood was collected from the heart to separate the serum, and the blood creatinine (Scr) and urea nitrogen (BUN) contents were detected biochemically. After blood collection, the kidney tissue was taken and fixed in10% neutral formalin. The expression of renal tissue inflammatory factors (CRP, IL-6, and TNF-\u00ce\u00b1) and renal fibrosis indexes (LN, HA, and TGF-\u00ce\u00b21) were detected; MMP-24 and TIMP-1 in the kidney tissue of rats in different treatment groups were detected, and Smad3 expression was also detected. Results. After treatment, the general condition of the alcohol + dapagliflozin group and the alcohol + losartan group improved to different degrees. The weight first decreased and then gradually increased over time. There was no statistical difference in the weight change between the two groups; Compared with the control group, the Scr level, BUN content, renal index, inflammatory factors, and renal fibrosis indexes in the alcohol group were significantly increased (P<0.05); after 6 weeks of treatment, in the alcohol + dapagliflozin group and alcohol + losartan group, Scr level, BUN content, kidney index, inflammatory factors, and renal fibrosis indexes were significantly decreased (P<0.05); the expression of MMP-24 in the kidney tissue of the control group was upregulated, and the expression of TIMP-1 and Smad3 was downregulated; MMP-24 expression was downregulated, and TIMP-1 and Smad3 expression was significantly upregulated (P<0.05) in the rats of the alcohol group. After dapagliflozin and losartan treatment, MMP-24 expression gradually increased and TIMP-1 and Smad3 expression gradually decreased (P<0.05). Conclusion. Long-term large-scale alcohol intake can cause kidney tissue damage and fibrotic lesions. The expression of fibrotic cytokines such as TIMP-1 and Smad3 will increase, and the expression of MMP-24 will be decreased. However, dapagliflozin and losartan have certain therapeutic effects on the abovementioned lesions.

This post-translationally modified pGlu-A\u00ce\u00b2 possesses high toxicity and rapid aggregation propensity when compared to the wild-type A\u00ce\u00b2 (WT-A\u00ce\u00b2). Since pGlu-A\u00ce\u00b2 acts as seed for WT-A\u00ce\u00b2, the inhibition of sQC limits the formation of pGlu-A\u00ce\u00b2 and reduces the overall load of A\u00ce\u00b2 plaques in the AD brain.

Understanding the binding mode of PQ912 is important as it helps in the discovery against AD where sQC as a target. To explore the binding mode of PQ912, we employed ensemble docking towards 9 sQC structures that differ either in active site geometry or in the bound ligands. Further pose clustering and binding energy calculations yielded three possible binding modes for PQ912.

Purpose: To describe real-world osteoporosis treatment patterns in individuals with a fragility fracture in France and to explore the impact of initiating treatment on the risk of subsequent fracture. Methods: A retrospective cohort study, using the national French Health Insurance claims database. Males and females 50 years and over, with a hospital discharge diagnosis of osteoporosis with fracture or a relevant fragility fracture between 2011 and 2014, were included and followed until death or the end of 2016, whichever came first. The primary outcome was the proportion of patients receiving anti-osteoporosis treatments prior to and post-index fracture. Change in fracture rates before and after treatment initiation was assessed in an exploratory analysis. Results: A total of 574,133 patients (138,567 males, 435,566 females) had a qualifying index fracture. The proportion of patients receiving any anti-osteoporosis treatment increased pre-index fracture to post-index fracture from 2.2 to 5.6% among males, and from 11.8 to 18.2% among females.

Introduction: Little is known about the relationship between exposure levels of mycophenolic acid (MPA), the active metabolite of mycophenolate mofetil (MMF), and comorbidities of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) in children. This study aims to explore this association. Methods: Longitudinal data from SLE children, who were taking MMF for immunosuppression and under therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM), were retrospectively collected. Area under the concentration-time curve of mycophenolic acid (MPA) over 24 hours (AUC0\u00e2\u20ac\u201c24h) was estimated with Bayesian methods. Logistic regression and random forest models were used to explore the association between comorbidities and MPA exposure levels. Results: This study included 107 children with 358 times of follow-up (median age 169.02 months). The incidence of diabetes, acute kidney injury (AKI), or pneumonia was significantly associated with AUC0\u00e2\u20ac\u201c24h (odds ratio [OR] 0.991, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.982\u00e2\u20ac\u201c0.999), SLE duration (OR 1.012, 95% CI 1.002\u00e2\u20ac\u201c1.022), lymphocyte percentage (OR 0.959, 95% CI 0.925\u00e2\u20ac\u201c0.991), plasma albumin levels (OR 0.891, 95% CI 0.843\u00e2\u20ac\u201c0.940), use of aspirin (OR 0.292, 95% CI 0.126\u00e2\u20ac\u201c0.633) and hydroxychloroquine (OR 0.407, 95% CI 0.184\u00e2\u20ac\u201c0.906).

Dosimetric studies showed that the biologically effective dose (BED) of 225Ac-labeled OTSA101 for tumors was 7.8 Bd higher than that of 90Y-labeled OTSA101. 90Y- and 225Ac-labeled OTSA101 decreased tumor volume and prolonged survival. 225Ac-labeled OTSA101 achieved a complete response in 60% of mice, and no recurrence was observed. 225Ac-labeled OTSA101 induced a larger amount of necrosis and apoptosis than 90Y-labeled OTSA101, although the cell proliferation decrease was comparable. The BED for normal organs and tissues was tolerable; no treatment-related mortality or obvious toxicity, except for temporary body weight loss, was observed. 225Ac-labeled OTSA101 provided a high BED for tumors and achieved a 60% complete response in the synovial sarcoma mouse model SYO-1.

Although sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors lower serum uric acid, their long-term effect on uric acid metabolism is not well understood. We analyzed pooled data from studies wherein patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus received luseogliflozin, an SGLT2 inhibitor. Upon stratifying patients by baseline glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) or serum uric acid, lower HbA1c or higher serum uric acid level was associated with a greater reduction in serum uric acid after treatment. At week 12 of treatment, significant increases in urinary glucose/creatinine (Cr) ratio and urinary uric acid clearance/Cr clearance ratio (CUA/CCr ratio) and a significant reduction in serum uric acid were observed. Comparison of the subgroups of patients with a reduction or an increase in serum uric acid showed that the increase subgroup had a higher estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) at baseline, and the eGFR was significantly reduced, associated with a significant reduction in the CUA/CCr ratio. Multiple regression analysis showed that the reduction in serum uric acid in the luseogliflozin group was strongly associated with baseline high serum uric acid, low HbA1c levels, and an increase in eGFR. Luseogliflozin was shown to reduce serum uric acid by enhancing urinary uric acid excretion in association with increased urinary glucose. Treatment with luseogliflozin resulted in increased serum uric acid in some patients, which may be due to reduced glomerular filtration of uric acid via the tubuloglomerular feedback.

This study investigates the feasibility of catalpol intranasal administration and its protective effect on acute cerebral ischemia in rats via anti-oxidative and anti-apoptotic mechanisms. Patients and Methods: This study investigates the method of catalpol intranasal administration to evaluate the nasal mucosal toxicity, brain targeting and pharmacokinetics of catalpol. The protective effect of catalpol of intranasal administration on stroke-induced brain injury in rats and its mechanisms on oxidative stress pathway Nrf2/HO-1 and apoptosis were also investigated using middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO). Results: The results showed that catalpol intranasal administration was safe and feasible with no hemolysis, no bad effect on the maxillary ciliary movement of bullfrog. After intranasal administration, the brain targeting index (DTI) of catalpol was greater than 1, which indicated that catalpol had good brain targeting after intranasal administration. The bioavailability of catalpol administered intranasally was higher than that of in plasma. In MACO model, catalpol intranasal administration could significantly reduce cerebral infarction volume, neurological dysfunction and brain edema.

The current ESMO and NCCN guidelines attempted to describe treatment algorithms for pancreatic NET based on the current data. In our survey, we recorded therapy decisions for the first-until the third-line of therapy in German-speaking countries (Germany, Austria, and Switzerland) using fictional case reports and discussed these in the context of the current ESMO guidelines. Compared with the recommendations of the guidelines, PRRT was used more frequently and earlier. In patients with NET G1/G2 Ki-67 < 10%, the therapy algorithm consisting of somatostatin analogs (SSA)-PRRT-targeted therapy is a relevant approach. In clinical situations where chemotherapy is primarily used (remission pressure, Ki-67 > 10%), second-line PRRT was found acceptance and was often considered prior to targeted therapies. Despite the lack of prospective controlled trials, our study demonstrated the pivotal impact of PRRT. Therefore, further studies should compare PRRT with chemotherapy in pancreatic NETs in different clinical settings in first-and second-line approaches.",

Introduction: Inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) are often prescribed inappropriately alongside long-acting bronchodilators for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). We aimed to investigate if prescribing habits in the US and UK differ from recommendations for initiation of COPD maintenance therapy. Methods: We used healthcare data from the US IBM\u00c2\u00ae MarketScan\u00c2\u00ae and UK Clinical Practice Research Datalink databases to assess exacerbations and comorbidities in patients with COPD initiating first maintenance therapy (1MT) between 2015 and 2018. Patients with a recorded asthma diagnosis prior to initiation of 1MT were excluded. We evaluated time from recorded diagnosis of COPD until initiation of 1MT, and treatment regimen at 1MT (long-acting muscarinic antagonist [LAMA], long-acting \u00ce\u00b22-agonist [LABA], ICS, as monotherapy or in combination). Results: In the US and UK, median (IQR) time between recorded COPD diagnosis and 1MT was 158 (12; 839) and 29 (1; 521) days, respectively. Among the 53,473 US patients and 8786 UK patients who initiated 1MT, 50.9% and 32.4% had \u00e2\u2030\u00a5 1 exacerbation in the previous year.

Background: The Abiomed Impella 5.5 (Danvers, MA) is a newly developed axial flow transaortic cardiac support device mounted on a 9 Fr steering catheter with a 21 Fr pump cannula. Impella 5.5 is intended for longer use and was approved for 30 days in 2018. This study evaluated the first-in-man series at six high-volume mechanical circulatory support centers in Germany after CE approval. Methods: The first 46 consecutive patients worldwide underwent implantation in six German centers between March 2018 and September 2019 for post-CE approval evaluation. The primary end-point was 30 days and 90 days all-cause mortality. Results: The mean age of patients was 59.0 \u00c2\u00b1 11.5 years, and 43 (93.4%) were men. Half of the patients had acute on chronic heart failure. The main indication for Impella 5.5 implantation was ischemic cardiomyopathy and acute myocardial infarction (47.8%). The mean support time was 15.5 \u00c2\u00b1 24.2 days (range 0-164, median 10 days (IQR = 7-19)) with a total of 712 patient-days on support. The 30 days and 90 days survival rates were 73.9% (95% CI: 63.3\u00e2\u20ac\u201c88.9%) and 71.7% (95% CI: 60.7-87.1%), respectively. Additionally, 16 patients (34.8%) were weaned from the device for native heart recovery, and 19 (41.3%) were bridged to a durable device. Fifteen patients (32.6%) were mobilized to a chair, and 15 (32.6%) were ambulatory. We only noted one stroke and found no other thromboembolic complications. No aortic valve damage was observed in the study cohort. Finally, seven patients (15.2 %) had pump thrombosis, and nine (19.6 %) underwent device exchange. Sixteen patients (34.8 %) suffered from bleeding requiring transfusions during the whole treatment course. In ten patients (21.7%), the inflow cannula dislocated into the aortic root. Conclusions: The first version of the Impella 5.5 presents promising early outcomes for patients with acute heart failure and expands the spectrum of available devices.

Purpose: Fisetin is a natural flavone of polyphenol, which widely exists in many fruits and vegetables and has many pharmacological activities. However, the mechanism involved remains largely unknown. Here, we investigate the mechanisms of fisetin on the inflammatory response and oxidative stress in LPS-induced endometritis model and bovine endome-trial epithelial cell line (BEND). Methods: The function of fisetin was analyzed by network pharmacology. Effects of increasing doses of fisetin on inflammation and oxidative stress are studied in BALB/c mice with LPS-induced endometritis. The underlying mechanisms of antioxidant activity of fisetin were further explored in LPS-stimulated BEND cells. Results: The results showed that fisetin significantly alleviated LPS-induced inflammatory injury and oxidative stress both in vivo and in vitro. Further studies found that fisetin greatly inhibited the LPS stimulated TLR4 expression and nuclear translocation of nuclear factor-\u00ce\u00baB (NF-\u00ce\u00baB), thus reducing the pro-inflammatory mediators secretion. Silencing TLR4 reduced LPS-induced inflammatory responses. Moreover, we observed that fisetin evidently decreased ROS production but activated Nrf2/HO-1 pathway in LPS-stimulated BEND cells. To further explore the role of Nrf2 in fisetin-induced HO-1 protein expression, the specific siRNA was used to silence Nrf2 expression. Silencing Nrf2 abrogated the inhibitory effects of fisetin on LPS-induced pro-inflammatory cytokines TNF-\u00ce\u00b1, IL-1\u00ce\u00b2 secretion, NADPH oxidase-4 (Nox4) and ROS production.

A 43-year-old man with a 20 pack-year history of smoking presented with chest pain and hemoptysis that began one month previously. Chest computed tomography (CT) confirmed a 5-cm mass in the right upper lobe involving the right hilum with occlusion of the right main stem bronchus with ipsilateral mediastinal lymph node enlargement (Fig.1A). The primary tumor extended into the mediastinum,but there was no external compression of the carina. The patient was diagnosed as having stage IIIB non-small cell lung cancer. He received concurrent chemo-radiotherapy with cisplatin and etoposide and 60 Gy of radiation to the primary tumor. The dose distribution was calculated based on the CT image, and three-dimensional irradiation was performed. However, the tumor invaded the superior vena cava (SVC); hence, irradiation of the SVC was unavoidable. Fluoro-deoxyglucose-positron emission tomography (FDG-PET)//CT scan performed three months after treatment completion demonstrated complete response to the chemo-radiotherapy. FDG-PET/CT also showed no uptake at a radiation fibrosis near the SVC. At 48 months of follow-up, the patient presented with progressive facial and neck swelling. FDG-PET/CT scan showed pinpoint narrowing of the SVC. As the radiation fibrotic lesion near the SVC did not enlarge or present FDG uptake (Fig. 1B), SVC syndrome was evaluated not by recurrence of lung cancer but by the fibrotic lesion. Stent placement in the SVC and anticoagulation with warfarin was initiated.SVC syndrome was controlled by replacement and development of collateral circulation. Since pleural disseminated lesions were found in the CT scan at that time, the disseminated lesions were treated with irradiation, subsequent chemotherapy and immune checkpoint inhibitors. Thereafter, we conducted FDG-PET/CT scans six times every six months, but the radiation fibrotic lesion near the SVC did not enlarge or present FDG uptake. Two years after the onset of SVC syndrome, the lesion near the SVC had not enlarged and presented no FDG uptake in the FDG-PET/CT scan (Fig. 1C).The patient died of meningeal carcinomatosis that developed 7 years after the initial chemo-radiotherapy.Autopsy examination was not performed.",

Objective: Rare disease Background: Cisplatin/5-fluorouracil therapy is the standard therapy for unresectable and recurrent esophageal cancer. Cisplatin-based chemotherapy often causes adverse effects, such as nausea, vomiting, and renal dysfunction, which may necessitate dose modification or treatment prolongation. Therefore, novel combination therapies are urgently needed to improve the efficacy and overcome drug toxicity in this setting. Case Report: A 77-year-old man with advanced esophageal cancer received cisplatin/5-fluorouracil therapy as neoadjuvant chemotherapy. On day 8 of administration, the patient had lightheadedness, diaphoresis, and nausea and became unconscious and developed severe hyponatremia. We diagnosed the patient with cisplatin-induced syndrome of inadequate antidiuretic hormone secretion (SIADH). Subsequently, water restriction was started, and treatment with a salt-added diet and 3% hypertonic saline infusion was initiated. The hyponatremia improved and the patient was discharged on day 16 of administration. Therefore, neoadjuvant chemotherapy was discontinued, and surgical treatment was performed. However, the tumor recurred and chemotherapy was required. The patient developed severe hyponatremia while receiving neoadjuvant chemotherapy; hence, folinic acid, fluorouracil, and oxaliplatin therapy (FOLFOX) were administered as an alternative treatment. The patient completed the FOLFOX therapy without developing SIADH. Conclusions: The cisplatin/5-fluorouracil therapy is currently the standard chemotherapy regimen for esophageal cancer. However, SIADH is a known adverse effect when using cisplatin. In patients with esophageal cancer, oxalipla-tin appears to have a lower risk of SIADH than cisplatin, suggesting that oxaliplatin can be a therapeutic option for patients with esophageal cancer who are at high risk of SIADH.",

The chimeric Opto-mGluR6 protein represents such a tool. With exclusive ON-bipolar cell expression, it combines the light-sensitive domains of melanopsin and the intracellular domains of the metabotropic glutamate receptor 6 (mGluR6), which naturally mediates light responses in these cells.

Spinal cord injury (SCI) refers to a major worldwide cause of accidental death and disability. However, the complexity of the pathophysiological mechanism can result in less-effective clinical treatment. Growth differentiation factor 11 (GDF-11), an antiageing factor, was reported to affect the development of neurogenesis and exert a neuroprotective effect after cerebral ischaemic injury. The present work is aimed at investigating the influence of GDF-11 on functional recovery following SCI, in addition to the potential mechanisms involved. We employed a mouse model of spinal cord contusion injury and assessed functional outcomes via the Basso Mouse Scale and footprint analysis following SCI. Using western blot assays and immunofluorescence, we analysed the levels of pyroptosis, autophagy, necroptosis, and molecules related to the AMPK-TRPML1-calcineurin signalling pathway. The results showed that GDF-11 noticeably optimized function-related recovery, increased autophagy, inhibited pyroptosis, and alleviated necroptosis following SCI. Furthermore, the conducive influences exerted by GDF-11 were reversed with the application of 3-methyladenine (3MA), an autophagy suppressor, indicating that autophagy critically impacted the therapeutically related benefits of GDF-11 on recovery after SCI. In the mechanistic study described herein, GDF-11 stimulated autophagy improvement and subsequently inhibited pyroptosis and necroptosis, which were suggested to be mediated by TFE3; this effect resulted from the activity of TFE3 through the AMPK-TRPML1-calcineurin signalling cascade.

Eight-to-twelve-week-old C57BL/6J Xbp1-floxed (Xbp1f/f) and hepatocyte-specific knockout Xbp1 mice (Xbp1\u00e2\u02c6\u2020hepa) were challenged with either high dose APAP [500 mg/kg] and sacrificed at early (1\u00e2\u20ac\u201c2 h) and late (24 h) stages of hepatotoxicity. Histopathological examination of livers, immunofluorescence and immunohistochemistry, Western blot, real time (RT)-qPCR studies and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) were performed. Pharmacological inhibition of XBP1 using pre-treatment with STF-083010 [STF, 75 mg/kg] and autophagy induction with Rapamycin [RAPA, 8 mg/kg] or blockade with Chloroquine [CQ, 60 mg/kg] was also undertaken in vivo. Cytoplasmic expression of XBP1 coincided with severity of human and murine hyperacute liver injury.

Here, we investigated the role of GE in a mouse model in which mice were fed with 3,5-diethoxycarbonyl-1,4-dihydrocollidine (DDC) for 4 weeks to induce sclerosing cholangitis. The results demonstrated that the increased hepatic gene expressions of pro-inflammatory (IL-6, VCAM-1, MCP-1, and F4/80) and profibrogenic markers (Col1\u00ce\u00b11, Col1\u00ce\u00b12, TGF-\u00ce\u00b2, and \u00ce\u00b1-SMA) in DDC feeding mice were reversed after treatment with GE. GE also suppressed expressions of CK19 and Ki67 in DDC-fed mice, suggesting that GE could ameliorate DDC-induced hepatocytes and cholangiocytes proliferation. In addition, GE significantly increased bile acids (BAs) secretion in bile, which correlated with induced expressions of hepatic FXR, BAs secretion transporters (BSEP, MRP2, MDR1, and MDR2), and reduced CYP7A1 mRNA expression. Furthermore, higher expressions of ileal FXR-FGF15 signaling and reduced ASBT were also observed after GE treatment.

Objective: To describe the geographic variation in gabapentinoids, opioids and concurrent use of both for pain by US state and metropolitan statistical area (MSA). Methods: We conducted a cross-sectional study on December 1, 2018, among commercially insured adults aged 18\u00e2\u20ac\u201c64 years without epilepsy or opioid use disorders using IBM\u00c2\u00ae MarketScan\u00c2\u00ae Research Databases.

Results: We included 9,314,197 beneficiaries; 1.4% had gabapentinoids, 1.5% had opioids and 0.3% had concurrent use of both. The majority of gabapentinoid use lacked an FDA-approved indication. Use of the analgesic regimens varied across states (gabapentinoids (median (interquartile range)): 1.4% (1.2\u00e2\u20ac\u201c1.7%); opioids: 1.5% (1.2\u00e2\u20ac\u201c1.9%); both: 0.3% (0.2\u00e2\u20ac\u201c0.4%)) and MSAs (gabapentinoids: 1.6% (1.3\u00e2\u20ac\u201c2.0%); opioids: 1.8% (1.3\u00e2\u20ac\u201c2.3%); both: 0.3% (0.2\u00e2\u20ac\u201c0.5%)). Demographics explained the largest proportion of the between-state and between-MSA variation. The pattern of the geographic variation in gabapentinoids was similar to that of opioids across states and MSAs. Conclusion: Gabapentinoids were as commonly used as opioids for pain in a commercially insured population (mostly off-label).

In this study, we investigated the enhancing effect of 20(S)-Rh2 on levofloxacin (LVF) from a perspective of intracellular bacteria. In S. aureus 25923-infected mice, coadministration of LVF (1.5 mg/kg, i.v.) and 20(S)-Rh2 (25, 50 mg/kg, i.g.) markedly increased the survival rate, and decreased intracellular bacteria counts accompanied by increased accumulation of LVF in peritoneal macrophages.

In a model of S. aureus 25923-infected THP-1 macrophages, we showed that 20(S)-Rh2 (1, 5, 10 \u00ce\u00bcM) dose-dependently enhanced the intracellular antibacterial activity of LVF. At the cellular level, 20(S)-Rh2 increased the intracellular accumulation of LVF by inhibiting P-gp and BCRP.

Most of the patients included in these trials received metformin as background therapy. Aim: To evaluate the effect of glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonists on major cardiovascular events (MACE) and mortality in metformin-na\u00c3\u00afve patients with type 2 diabetes. Methods: A systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled clinical trials of GLP-1RAs on type 2 diabetes population was performed, after searching the PubMed/MEDLINE, Embase, Scielo, Google Scholar and Cochrane Controlled Trials databases. The primary endpoint was MACE. The secondary endpoints were cardiovascular death and all-cause mortality. A meta-analysis of time-to-event outcomes was performed. This meta-analysis was registered in PROSPERO (CRD42021260040) Results: Seven trials, including 11510 patients, were identified and considered eligible for the analyses. GLP-1RAs were associated with a significant reduction in MACE incidence (HR: 0.86, 95% confidence interval: 0.79\u00e2\u20ac\u201c0.94; I2: 0%).

Psoriasis, a chronic inflammatory skin disease, is characterized by the excessive proliferation and impaired differentiation of epidermal keratinocytes and is accompanied by the increased infiltration of inflammatory cells.

Gomisin M2 (GM2), a lignan extracted from Schisandra chinensis (Turcz). Baill.

IMQ was topically applied to the back skin of mice for 7 consecutive days, and the mice were orally administered CD. These results showed that the oral administration of GM2 suppressed the symptoms of psoriasis, as evidenced by reductions in skin thickness, psoriasis area severity index scores for psoriasis lesions, transepidermal water loss and myeloperoxidase (MPO)-associated cell infiltration. Furthermore, GM2 reduced the pathologically increased levels of immunoglobulin G2a, MPO and TNF-a in the serum and T helper (Th)1 and Th17 cell populations in the spleen.

Here, we reported that gut microbiota-derived L-Histidine and its secondary metabolite imidazole propionate (ImP) fought against radiation-induced cardiopulmonary injury in an entiric flora-dependent manner in mouse models. Local chest irradiation decreased the level of L-Histidine in fecal pellets, which was increased following fecal microbiota transplantation.

We aimed at developing infectious genotype 4 cell culture systems to understand the evolutionary genetic landscapes of antiviral resistance, which can help preserve the future efficacy of DAA-based therapy. Design HCV recombinants were tested in liver-derived cells. Long-term coculture with DAAs served to induce antiviral-resistance phenotypes. Next-generation sequencing (NGS) of the entire HCV-coding sequence identified mutation networks. Resistance-associated substitutions (RAS) were studied using reverse-genetics. Result The in-vivo infectious ED43(4a) clone was adapted in Huh7.5 cells, using substitutions identified in ED43(Core-NS5A)/JFH1-chimeric viruses combined with selected NS5B-changes. NGS, and linkage analysis, permitted identification of multiple genetic branches emerging during culture adaptation, one of which had 31 substitutions leading to robust replication/propagation. Treatment of culture-adapted ED43 with nine clinically relevant protease-DAA, NS5A-DAA and NS5B-DAA led to complex dynamics of drug-target-specific RAS with coselection of genome-wide substitutions. Approved DAA combinations were efficient against the original virus, but not against variants with RAS in corresponding drug targets.

While HER2 inhibitors have significantly improved therapeutic outcomes, many patients remain resistant to therapy. An important intrinsic resistance mechanism to HER2 inhibition in some breast cancers is dynamic upregulation of HER3. Increase in HER3 expression that occurs in response to HER2 inhibition allows for continued growth signaling through HER2/HER3 heterodimers, promoting tumor escape. We hypothesized that a non-invasive method to image changes in HER3 expression would be valuable to identify those breast cancers that dynamically upregulate HER3 in response to HER2 inhibition. We further hypothesized that this imaging method could identify those tumors that would benefit by additional HER3 knockdown. Procedures: In a panel of HER2+ breast cancer cell lines treated with the HER2 inhibitor lapatinib, we evaluate changes in HER3 expression and viability. Mouse HER2+ breast cancer models treated with lapatinib were imaged with a peptide-based HER3-specific PET imaging agent [68Ga]HER3P1 to assess for dynamic changes in tumoral HER3 expression and uptake confirmed by biodistribution. Subsequently, HER2+ cell lines were treated with the HER2 inhibitor lapatinib as well HER3-specific siRNA to assess for changes in viability and correlate with HER3 expression upregulation. For all statistical comparisons, P<0.05 was considered statistically significant. Results: Lapatinib treatment of a panel of HER2+ breast cancer cell lines increased HER3 expression in the lapatinib-resistant cell line MDA-MB 453 but not the lapatinib-resistant cell-line HCC-1569. Evaluation of [68Ga]HER3P1 uptake in mice implanted with the HER2+ breast cancer cell lines MDA-MB453 or HCC-1569 prior to and after treatment with lapatinib demonstrated a significant increase in MDA-MB453 tumors only, consistent with in vitro findings. The additional knockdown of HER3 increased therapeutic efficacy of lapatinib only in MDA-MB453 cells, but not in HCC-1569 cells.

The purpose of this work was to investigate the chemical composition and evaluate the antimicrobial activity of extracts obtained from the leaves (aqueous) and bark (hydroethanolic) of S. mombin both as single treatments and in combination with conventional drugs. Following a qualitative chemical prospection, the extracts were analyzed by HPLC\u00e2\u20ac\u201cDAD. The antimicrobial activities were evaluated by microdilution. The combined activity of drugs and extracts was verified by adding a subinhibitory concentration of the extract in the presence of variable drug concentrations. The Minimum Fungicidal Concentration (MFC) was determined by a subculture of the microdilution test, while the effect of the in vitro treatments on morphological transition was analyzed by subculture in moist chambers. While the qualitative analysis detected the presence of phenols and flavonoids, the HPLC analysis identified quercetin, caffeic acid, and catechin as major components in the leaf extract, whereas kaempferol and quercetin were found as major compounds in the bark extract.

Antibody levels were analyzed at four times: before vaccination (visit 1), 4 weeks after the first vaccination (visit 2), 3 months after the second vaccination (visit 3), and 6 months after the second vaccination (visit 4). Results: A total of 249 healthcare workers at Jeju National University Hospital were enrolled in this study, and 982 blood samples were analyzed. The mean age was 38.1 \u00c2\u00b1 9.5 years, and 145 (58.2%) participants were females. Positive nAbs (inhibition rates \u00e2\u2030\u00a5 20%) were measured in 166/249 (66.7%) subjects at visit 2, 237/243 (97.5%) subjects at visit 3, and 150/237 (63.3%) subjects at visit 4. A S-IgG (\u00e2\u2030\u00a550 AU/mL) positivity was detected in 246/249 (98.8%) subjects at visit 1, and all participants had positive S-IgG antibody levels at visits 3 and 4 after being fully vaccinated. Further analysis of S-IgG levels revealed a median quantitative antibody level of 1275.1 AU/mL (interquartile range [IQR] 755.5\u00e2\u20ac\u201c2119.0) at visit 2, 2765.9 AU/mL (IQR 1809.8\u00e2\u20ac\u201c4138.4) at visit 3, and 970.1 AU/mL (IQR 606.0\u00e2\u20ac\u201c1495.9) at visit 4. Patient characteristics, such as age, body mass index, and comorbidity, had no relationship with nAb or S-IgG levels at any of the visits. Considering the change in antibody levels over time, both nAb and S-IgG levels at visit 4 decreased compared with the corresponding levels at visit 3. No evidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection was found among any of the participants throughout the study. Conclusions: The BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine was effective in protecting healthcare personnel working in COVID-19-related departments. While the level of S-IgG antibodies was maintained for 6 months after the second vaccination, nAb levels waned over this 6-month period, indicating the need for a booster vaccination in some healthcare workers 6 months after full vaccination. Herein, we suggest that further studies are needed to evaluate the need for an interval of booster vaccination after full vaccination.",

Patients and methods: We retrospectively assessed HHR at the time of diagnosis in 107 PV and 40\u00c2\u00a0secondary polycythemia (SP) patients from three community hospitals. Results: Median HHR was higher in PV than in SP patients (3.131 vs. 2.975, p\u00e2\u20ac\u00af= 0.041). Among PV patients, higher HHR correlated with splenomegaly, higher total leukocyte and absolute granulocyte counts, higher red blood cell counts, lower hemoglobin, higher red blood cell distribution width, lower mean corpuscular hemoglobin and lower ferritin levels, whereas in SP patients higher HHR correlated with older age, female sex and lower hemoglobin (p\u00e2\u20ac\u00af< 0.050 for all analyses).

Introduction: While the clinical course of SARS-CoV-2 infection seems to be milder or asymptomatic within the pediatric population, growing attention has been laid to the rare complication elicited by virus, multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children temporarily associated with COVID-19 (MIS-C). Published definition and criteria of MIS-C include persistent fever, multisystem involvement, and elevated markers of inflammation, without obvious microbial inflammation or other plausible diagnosis. However, the aim of this case report is to emphasize the diversity of symptoms of MIS-C, beyond the defined criteria. Case Presentation: We present a 10-year-old boy with 8p23.1 microdeletion syndrome and multiple comorbidities who initially came to our attention due to hematuria, persistent fever, rash, and elevated markers of inflammation. Within the next 2 days, his condition worsened despite the broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy. Assuming his past history of SARS-CoV-2 exposure, MIS-C was suspected. A high level of clinical suspicion was further supported by significant clinical features (vomiting, abdominal pain, conjunctivitis, arrhythmia, and mild left ventricular systolic dysfunction with pleural effusion) along with laboratory findings (elevated ESR, CRP, proBNP, D-dimers and fibrinogen, positive IgG SARS-CoV-2 antibodies, and negative microbiological cultures). The patient was given intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) and began to show instantaneous clinical and laboratory improvement. Conclusion: Despite numerous reports of MIS-C cases in children, there are still many uncertainties regarding the clinical presentation and laboratory findings, as well as mechanisms beyond this intriguing disorder. In our case, for the first time hematuria is reported as an early symptom of MIS-C. We strongly believe that reporting various manifestations and outcomes in MIS-C patients will lead to improved diagnosis, treatment, and overall understanding of this novel inflammatory condition.",

We aimed to compare systemic and cerebral hemodynamics and coughing during emergence after pituitary surgery after endotracheal tube (ETT) extubation or after replacing ETT with a laryngeal mask airway (LMA). Patients were randomized to awaken with an ETT in place or after replacing it with an LMA. We recorded mean arterial pressure (MAP), heart rate, middle cerebral artery (MCA) flow velocity, regional cerebral oxygen saturation (SrO2), cardiac index, plasma norepinephrine, need for vasoactive drugs, coughing during emergence, and postoperative cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leakage. The primary endpoint was postoperative MAP; secondary endpoints were SrO2 and coughing incidence. Forty-five patients were included. MAP was lower during emergence than at baseline in both groups. There were no significant between-group differences in blood pressure, nor in the number of patients that required antihypertensive drugs during emergence (ETT: 8 patients (34.8%) vs. LMA: 3 patients (14.3%); p = 0.116).

Ischemic stroke is the most common type of stroke and thrombolytic therapy is the only approved treatment. However, current thrombolytic therapy with tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) is often hampered by the increased risk of hemorrhage. Plasmin, a direct fibrinolytic, has a significantly superior hemostatic safety profile; however, if injected intravenously it becomes rapidly inactivated by anti-plasmin. Nanoformulations have been shown to increase drug stability and half-life and hence could be applied to increase the plasmin therapeutic efficacy. Here in this paper, we report a novel heparin and arginine-based plasmin nanoformulation that exhibits increased plasmin stability and efficacy. In vitro studies revealed significant plasmin stability in the presence of anti-plasmin and efficient fibrinolytic activity. In addition, these particles showed no significant toxicity or oxidative stress effects in human brain microvascular endothelial cells, and no significant blood brain barrier permeability. Further, in a mouse photothrombotic stroke model, plasmin nanoparticles exhibited significant efficacy in reducing stroke volume without overt intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) compared to free plasmin treatment.

Background: Hepatitis C (HCV) infection is prevalent in the prison setting, with sharing of unsterile injecting equipment the most common mode of transmission in high income countries. Mathematical modelling suggests that HCV treatment scale-up could prevent onward transmission, known as treatment as prevention. Direct-acting antivirals have enabled rapid scale up of HCV treatment, underpinning the first clinical trial of treatment as prevention in the prison setting. The Surveillance and Treatment of Prisoners with hepatitis C (SToP-C) study was carried out in four correctional centres in New South Wales, Australia. This paper utilises Sekhon's Theoretical Framework of Acceptability to examine correctional, prison health, and study personnel's assessments of acceptability of HCV treatment as prevention in the prison setting. Methods: Correctional (n=24) and health personnel (n=17) including officers, nurses (including seven study nurses), and senior administrators across the four prisons where SToP-C was delivered, participated in interviews. This included two maximum security, one minimum security, and one women's medium/minimum security prison. Data analysis was informed by a seven-component theory of acceptability. Results: Participants reported broad acceptability of HCV treatment as prevention in the prison setting across five components of acceptability (affective attitude, burden, ethicality, perceived effectiveness, and self-efficacy). Attributes contributing to acceptability included reduced HCV prevalence within the prison, and public health benefits for the community when people are released without HCV (affective attitude). Elements which may negatively impact on acceptability included limited clinic space (burden) and lack of correctional officers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 understanding of availability of equivalent healthcare in the community (ethicality). System-wide prison participation was viewed as necessary for treatment as prevention to be successful (perceived effectiveness), while nonjudgmental care was seen as instrumental to HCV treatment scale up efforts (self-efficacy). Conclusion: Correctional and prison-based health personnel view HCV treatment as prevention as an acceptable health intervention. Overall, environmental issues relating to implementation (i.e., clinic space) were viewed as requiring a strategic approach to support prison-wide HCV treatment scale up.",

The aim of this study was to evaluate PPAR\u00ce\u00b3 expression and localization in samples of primary human tumors and assess PFD-effect in early phases of hepatocarcinogenic process. Human HCC tissue samples were obtained by surgical resection. Experimental hepatocarcinogenesis was induced in male Fischer-344 rats.

NF-kB cascade, TNF\u00ce\u00b1, IL-6, and COX-2 expression and localization were evaluated as inflammation indicators. Caspase-3, p53, and PARP-1 were used as apoptosis markers, PCNA for proliferation. Finally, PPAR\u00ce\u00b1 and PPAR\u00ce\u00b3 expression were evaluated to understand the effect of PFD on the activation of such pathways.

However, the use of immunosuppressive agents may cause severe adverse events. In particular, patients treated with mTOR-inhibitors (mTOR-I) may ag-gravate pulmonary complications. It has been recently described that these drugs may induce Epithelial to Mesenchymal Transition (EMT) of the airway cells. Objective: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effects of mTOR-I on primary bronchial epithelial cells carrying F508del. Materials and Methods: Human bronchial epithelial cells homozygous for F508del were treated with 5 and 100 nM EVE for 24 hours, and their RNA was extracted and hybridized to the Human HT-12 v3 Expression BeadChip (Illumina). The microarray results were validated by Real-Time PCR. The tran-sepithelial resistance was measured by a Millicell-ERS ohmmeter. Results: High dosage EVE induced a significant up-regulation of 48 genes and a down-regulation of 14 genes. After pathway analysis by GSEA, we found that most of them were implicated in the inflammatory and pro-fibrotic pathways. Real-time PCR confirmed that 100 nM EVE was able to up-regulate some identified genes (IL-1alpha, IL-8, Pim-1) as well as pro-fibrotic elements (alpha-SMA, connective tissue growth factor, and metalloproteinase-12). In addition, a high dosage of EVE was al-so able to reduce transepithelial resistance. In contrast, a lower level of EVE did not produce similar effects.

Background: Globally, esophageal cancer ranks as the seventh most common cancer. Esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) is one of its major histological types. ESCC accounts for the vast majority of cases in China, and the mortality rate is high. Cisplatin, the standard adjuvant chemotherapy drug for ESCC, has a modest response rate due to the development of drug resistance. Hinokiflavone (HF) is a natural biflavonoid compound with anti-melanoma activity. However, its anti-tumor effect on ESCC and the underlying mechanisms remain largely unknown. Methods: The ESCC cell lines KYSE150 and TE14 were used. The cell counting kit-8 assay and flow cytometry analysis, along with colony formation, EdU, wound healing, and Transwell migration assays, were performed to assess cell characteristics (viability, migration, invasion, and apoptosis) following treatment with HF. Gene Ontology (GO), Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG), western blotting, and molecular docking were used to investigate the pathways potentially modulated by HF. In vivo anti-tumor effects of HF were also investigated using a mouse xenograft model. Results: Our findings revealed that HF inhibited ESCC cell proliferation. Hoechst 33342 staining, annexin V-FITC/PI staining, and western blotting confirmed that HF causes caspase-dependent apoptosis. KEGG pathway enrichment analysis and western blotting indicated that the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway played an important role in the process of HF-induced apoptosis. Furthermore, HF effectively impaired the migration and invasion abilities of KYSE150 cells and downregulated the expression of the matrix metalloproteinases (MMP) MMP2 and MMP9. HF inhibited tumor growth and exhibited minimal toxicity in the organs of the KYSE150 xenograft model. Conclusion: This is the first study to demonstrate the inhibition of ESCC growth and progression by HF. The underlying mechanism is through blocking the PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway, thereby inhibiting cell proliferation and inducing apoptosis.

A tailored diagnostic approach is advisable according to the presentation, clinical history, and known specificities of n-irAEs. Several patterns characterized by distinct clinical, immunological, and prognostic characteristics are beginning to emerge. For example, myasthenia gravis is more likely to develop after anti-programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) or anti-programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD-L1) treatment, while meningitis appears more frequently after anti-cytotoxic T lymphocyte antigen-4 (CTLA-4) therapy.

Recently, levels of anti-SARS-CoV-2 spike IgG antibodies and serum neutralization titers were confirmed as good immune markers of protection against the virus, with evidence showing a reverse correlation between these two parameters and susceptibility to infection. Here we analyzed sera from 138 nursing home residents (median age of 88.9 years) and 312 nursing home staff (median age of 50.7 years) to determine the humoral response to two doses of the BNT162b2 vaccine, and found markedly decreased serum anti-spike antibody levels and neutralization titers in the nursing home resident (NHR) group, with over 11% non-responders compared to only 1.3% among the controls. Moreover, three months post-vaccination, a significant decrease in antibody titers was observed in COVID-19-naive nursing home residents.

LA (lidocaine, bupivacaine, ropi-vacaine) were administered separately and co\u00e2\u20ac\u0090administered with the following substances: GC, HA, and GC/HA. Viability was confirmed by microscopic images, flow cytometry, metabolic activity, and live/dead assay. The addition of HA and GC/HA resulted in enhanced attachment and branched appearance of the chondrocytes compared to LA and LA/GC. Metabolic activity was bet-ter in all LA co\u00e2\u20ac\u0090administered with HA and GC/HA than with GC and only LA. Flow cytometry revealed the lowest cell viability in lidocaine and the highest cell viability in ropivacaine. This find-ing was also confirmed by live/dead assay. In conclusion, HA supports the effect of GC and reduces chondrotoxic effects of LA in vitro.

An insufficient oxygen supply within the intratumoral environment, also known as hypoxia, induces glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) invasion, stemness, and temozolomide (TMZ) drug resistance. Long noncoding (lnc)RNAs have been reported to be involved in hypoxia and GBM progression. However, their roles in hypoxic GBM malignancy are still unclear. We investigated the mechanisms of hypoxia-mediated lncRNAs in regulating GBM processes. Using The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and data mining, hypoxia-correlated lncRNAs were identified. A hypoxia-upregulated lncRNA, MIR210HG, locating in nuclear regions, predicted poor prognoses of patients and modulated hypoxia-promoted glioma stemness, TMZ resistance, and invasion. Depletion of hypoxic MIR210HG suppressed GBM and patient-derived cell growth and increased TMZ sensitivity in vitro and vivo. Using RNA sequencing and gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA), MIR210HG-upregulated genes significantly belonged to the targets of octamer transcription factor 1 (OCT1) transcription factor.

Purpose: Atherosclerosis, a chronic disease of the arteries, results from pathological processes including the accumulation and aggregation of oxidized low-density lipoprotein (oxLDL) in the vessel walls, development of neointima, formation of a fibrous cap, and migration of immune cells to damaged vascular endothelium. Recent studies have shown that mitochondrial dysfunction is closely associated with the development and progression of atherosclerosis. Idebenone, a short-chain benzoquinone similar in structure to coenzyme Q10, can effectively clear oxygen free radicals as an electron carrier and antioxidant. In the present study, we aim to investigate weather idebenone protects against atherosclerosis in apolipoprotein E-deficient (apoE\u00e2\u02c6\u2019/\u00e2\u02c6\u2019) mice. Methods: apoE\u00e2\u02c6\u2019/\u00e2\u02c6\u2019 mice receiving a high-fat diet (HFD) were treated with idebenone for 16\u00c2\u00a0weeks. A total of 60 mice were randomized into the following four groups: (1) HFD, (2) HFD and low-dose idebenone (100\u00c2\u00a0mg/kg/d), (3) HFD and medium-dose idebenone (200\u00c2\u00a0mg/kg/d), and (4) HFD and high-dose (400\u00c2\u00a0mg/kg/d). Proteomic analysis was performed between the HFD and idebenone-high-dose group. Plaque analysis was carried out by histological and immunohistochemical staining. Western blot, TUNEL staining, and MitoSOX assays were performed in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) to investigate the SIRT3-SOD2-mtROS pathway. Results: Histological and morphological analysis demonstrated that idebenone significantly reduced plaque burden and plaque size. Idebenone treatment effectively stabilized the atherosclerotic plaques. In mice treated with idebenone, 351 up-regulated and 379 down-regulated proteins were found to be significantly altered in proteomic analysis. In particular, the expression of SIRT3, SOD2, and NLRP3 was significantly regulated in the idebenone treatment groups compared with the HFD group both in vivo and in vitro. We further confirmed that idebenone protected against endothelial cell damage and inhibited the production of mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (mtROS) in cholesterol-treated HUVECs. Conclusions: We demonstrated that idebenone acted as a mitochondrial protective agent by inhibiting the activation of NLPR3 via the SIRT3-SOD2-mtROS pathway.

Using both gain-and loss-of-function experiments, we showed that miR-483-3p could regulate mitochondrial respiratory Complex II expression, suggesting its role in OXPHOS regulation. Functionally, miR-483-3p overexpression could rescue imatinib-induced cell death. These findings provide the molecular link for imatinib-induced OXPHOS expression and the biological role of miR-483-3p in regulating cell viability upon imatinib treatment.",

Background and Objectives: Patients who undergo total knee arthroplasty (TKA) have a risk of postoperative anaemia. This observational study evaluated whether single-dose intravenous ferric carboxymaltose (FCM) administered immediately after TKA facilitates the correction of anaemia. Materials and Methods: We retrospectively analysed 722 patients who underwent primary TKA. The FCM group receiving 1000 mg intravenous FCM within one postoperative hour was compared with the non-FCM group that did not receive the medication. A propensity score matching with multiple logistic regression analysis was used to minimize intergroup differences in the baseline characteristics and postoperative blood loss. The rate and severity of postoperative anaemia were compared between the groups, along with haemoglobin (Hb) value, transfusion rate and complications. Results: After propensity score matching, 231 patients were included in each group. In the FCM group, the rate of anaemia at postoperative day (POD) 7 (p\u00c2\u00a0=\u00c2\u00a00.021) and postoperative week (POW) 5 (p < 0.001) and the transfusion rate were significantly lower (p\u00c2\u00a0=\u00c2\u00a00.008). The rate of moderate to severe anaemia at POW-5 was also significantly lower in the FCM group (p < 0.001). In patients without preoperative anaemia (n\u00c2\u00a0=\u00c2\u00a0322), the transfusion rate and rate and severity of anaemia at POD-7 and POW-5 were significantly lower in the FCM group than in the non-FCM group. Conclusion: Postoperative intravenous FCM administration facilitated recovery of surgery-related anaemia by improving Hb and may reduce the need for transfusion in TKA patients.

Purpose: Immunogenicity of Covid-19 vaccines may be negatively impacted by anti-cancer treatment. The management of primary brain tumors (PBTs) routinely includes temozolomide and steroids, which are immune-suppressive. We aimed to determine the rate of seropositivity in PBT patients following receipt of two doses of the BNT162b2 vaccine. Methods: We prospectively evaluated IgG levels against SARS-CoV-2 spike protein in 17 PBT patients following two doses of the BNT162b2 vaccine. IgG levels were collected at two time points: T1\u00e2\u20ac\u201dafter a median of 44\u00c2\u00a0days from the second vaccine dose and T2\u00e2\u20ac\u201dafter a median of 130\u00c2\u00a0days from the second dose.

Results: At T1, 88.2% (15/17) of PBT patients achieved seroconversion, compared with 100% (12/12) of HCs. Median IgG titer was significantly lower in the PBT group (1908 AU/mL vs 8,198 AU/mL; p = 0.002). At T2, 80% (12/15) of PBT patients seroconverted, compared to 100% (10/10) of HCs.

The acceptance of ORV as an efficient supplementary tool is still low, not least because of limited immunogenicity and field trial data in local dogs. In this study, the immunogenicity of the highly attenuated 3rd-generation oral rabies vaccine strain SPBN GASGAS in local free-roaming dogs from Namibia was assessed by determining the immune response in terms of seroconversion for up to 56 days post-vaccination. At two study sites, free-roaming dogs were vaccinated by administering the vaccine either by direct oral administration or via a vaccine-loaded egg bait. Pre- and post-vaccination blood samples were tested for rabies virus neutralizing as well as binding antibodies using standard serological assays. A multiple logistic regression (MLR) analysis was performed to determine a possible influence of study area, vaccination method, and vaccine dose on the seroconversion rate obtained. About 78% of the dogs vaccinated by the oral route seroconverted (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, ELISA), though the seroconversion as determined by a rapid fluorescence focus inhibition test (RFFIT) was much lower.

This study used 36 samples of 28-day-old chicken kidneys. Chickens were kept in individual cages, provided with feed and drinking water ad libitum. The design used was a completely randomized design with 6 treatments and 6 replications: (a) chickens were reared in conditions exposed to heat (HS + 0); (b) chickens were reared in conditions exposed to heat and given Salix extract at a dose of 50 mg/L drinking water (HS + 50); (c) chickens were reared under heat-exposed conditions and given Salix extract at a dose of 100 mg/L drinking water (HS + 100); (d) chickens were reared in conditions without exposure to heat (n-HS + 0); (e) chickens were reared in conditions without exposure to heat and given Salix extract at a dose of 50 mg/L drinking water (nHS + 50); and (f) chickens were reared in conditions exposed without exposure to heat and given 100 mg/L drinking water (nHS + 100) of Salix extract.

The results showed that giving Salix extract 100 mg/L in drinking water to chickens exposed to heat (HS + 100) reduced the value of the H/L ratio. Giving Salix extract 50-100 mg/L in drinking water caused an upregulated AQP2 expression; on the other hand, it downregulated HSP-70 expression, in chicken kidney tubules both exposed to heat stress and nonexposed to heat stress.

The activity of immunotherapy in these patients, however, remains controversial, as the cornerstone treatment is radiotherapy (RT). Because RT is associated with adverse events that may impair the quality of life, the possibility of substituting it with a single systemic approach is attractive. Therefore, we performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to evaluate the potential benefit of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) in patients with NSCLC with untreated BM (unBM). Methods: Studies that enrolled patients with NSCLC treated with ICIs and specifically allowed for unBM were identified by searching the EMBASE, PubMed, Cochrane, and other databases. The outcomes evaluated were intracerebral overall response rate (icORR) and intracerebral disease control rate (icDCR) for unBM, and grades 3 and 4 toxicity rate.

Four age and sex-matched clinic and community controls were selected for each case within one to two weeks of case identification. Data on immunization status and confounders were collected. PCV coverage was estimated using vaccine coverage surveys. Case-control and incidence trend analyses were conducted to assess the impact of PCV on IPD. Results: The community cohort yielded 217,605 child years of observations and 154,773 sick child-visits to study hospitals. Pneumococcus was isolated from 44 children who were age-eligible to receive PCV; these children were enrolled as cases. The cases were matched with 166 community- and 150 clinic-controls. The matched case-control analyses using community-controls showed 83% effectiveness (95% CI: 1.57\u00e2\u20ac\u201c97.1%) and clinic controls showed 90% effectiveness (95% CI: \u00e2\u02c6\u201926.0% to 99.1%) of PCV in preventing IPD.

Methods: This was a\u00c2\u00a0single arm, before and after interventional study involving 18\u00c2\u00a0patients with moderate to severe asthma. Spirometry test, St George\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s respiratory questionnaire (SGRQ) and serum vitamin\u00c2\u00a0D assay were performed. Subjects with 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 (25-(OH) D3)\u00e2\u20ac\u00af< 20\u00e2\u20ac\u00afng/ml were deemed deficient (n\u00e2\u20ac\u00af= 18) and received 2 intramuscular injections of vitamin D3 300,000\u00e2\u20ac\u00afIU at monthly intervals consecutively. Results: The mean changes of forced expiratory volume in the first second (FEV1) were significantly different in subjects who received vitamin D3 injections (p\u00e2\u20ac\u00af= 0.008). Also, the mean changes in FEV1/forced vital capacity ratio (FEV1/FVC) were significant (p\u00e2\u20ac\u00af< 0.001) as well as maximum expiratory flow between 25% and 75% of FVC (MEF25-75) (p\u00e2\u20ac\u00af= 0.001).

Myocardial injury caused by COVID-19 was reported in hospitalized patients previously. But the information about cardiac consequences of COVID-19 after recovery is limited. The aim of the study was comprehensive echocardiography assessment of right ventricular (RV) in patients recovered from COVID-19. This is a prospective, single-center study. After recovery from COVID-19, echocardiography was performed in consecutive 79 patients that attended follow-up visits from July 15 to November 30, 2020. According to the recovery at home vs hospital, patients were divided into two groups: home recovery (n = 43) and hospital recovery (n = 36). Comparisons were made with age, sex and risk factor-matched control group (n = 41). In addition to conventional echocardiography parameters, RV global longitudinal strain (RV-GLS) and RV free wall strain (RV-FWS) were determined using 2D speckle-tracking echocardiography (2D STE). Of the 79 patients recovered from COVID-19, 43 (55%) recovered at home, while 36 (45%) required hospitalization. The median follow-up duration was 133 \u00c2\u00b1 35 (87\u00e2\u20ac\u201c184) days.

Introduction: Methotrexate (MTX) a folate antagonist is often given in high doses (\u00e2\u2030\u00a5500 mg/m2) to treat a variety of disease processes. While inpatient administration has been the norm, outpatient administration, has been shown to be safe, effective, and patient centered. Here in we describe development of an outpatient HDMTX protocol and our initial experience. Methods: All patients were to receive their first cycle of HDMTX in the hospital to ensure they tolerate it well and also to use this time to assist in training for home administration. The outpatient protocol involved continuous IV sodium bicarbonate, along with oral leucovorin and acetazolamide. Patients were required to visit the infusion center daily for labs and methotrexate levels. Clear criteria for admission were developed in the case of delayed clearance or methotrexate toxicity. Results: Two patients completed the safety run-in phase. Both patients tolerated treatment well. There were no associated toxicity. Methotrexate cleared within 3 days for all cycles. Both patients were able to follow the preadmission instructions for sodium bicarbonate and acetazolamide. The patients reported adequate teaching on the protocol and were able to maintain frequency of urine dipstick checks. Conclusion: We developed and implemented an outpatient protocol for high dose methotrexate. This study largely details the development of this protocol and its initial safety evaluation.

Aims: To assess the clinical relevance of a history of atrial fibrillation (AF) in hospitalized patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Methods and results: We enrolled 696 consecutive patients (mean age 67.4 \u00c2\u00b1 13.2 years, 69.7% males) admitted for COVID-19 in 13 Italian cardiology centres between 1 March and 9 April 2020. One hundred and six patients (15%) had a history of AF and the median hospitalization length was 14 days (interquartile range 9-24). Patients with a history of AF were older and with a higher burden of cardiovascular risk factors. Compared to patients without AF, they showed a higher rate of in-hospital death (38.7% vs. 20.8%; P < 0.001). History of AF was associated with an increased risk of death after adjustment for clinical confounders related to COVID-19 severity and cardiovascular comorbidities, including history of heart failure (HF) and increased plasma troponin [adjusted hazard ratio (HR): 1.73; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.06-2.84; P = 0.029]. Patients with a history of AF also had more in-hospital clinical events including new-onset AF (36.8% vs. 7.9%; P < 0.001), acute HF (25.3% vs. 6.3%; P < 0.001), and multiorgan failure (13.9% vs. 5.8%; P = 0.010). The association between AF and worse outcome was not modified by previous or concomitant use of anticoagulants or steroid therapy (P for interaction >0.05 for both) and was not related to stroke or bleeding events.

It is known that the combined use of vaccines, cytokines and various immunomodulatory drugs contributes to the development of a full-fledged immune response. This approach makes it possible to enhance the immunogenicity of modern vaccines and to direct the development of immune responses according to the humoral or cellular type, depending on the properties of the pathogen of a particular disease. The improvement of preventive drugs due to their combined use with cytokines and immunomodulators increases the intensity of immunity, increases the level of production of specific immunoglobulins, the protectivity of antigens, and also reduces the manifestation of adverse reactions leading to post-vaccination complications. Immunomodulators are already successfully used in drugs intended for the treatment and prevention of chronic herpes infections and influenza vaccines. Numerous experimental and clinical data indicate a positive effect of the use of immunomodulatory drugs in the vaccination of various viral and bacterial infections, including particularly dangerous ones. Improving the specific prevention of cholera can be achieved through immunomodulatory agents that can stimulate the formation of a local and systemic immune response. We conducted a comparative assessment of the feasibility of the combined use of the cholera bivalent chemical vaccine (the Federal Government Health Institution Antiplague Research Institute \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Microbe\u00e2\u20ac\u009d) and immunomodulators in order to increase the effectiveness of cholera vaccination. Since the cholera vaccine causes the activation of the humoral immune response, the production of specific immunoglobulins in the body of vaccinated experimental animals and the effect of immunomodulators on this process at different times of the post-vaccination period were evaluated. The ability of immunomodulators to increase the protective activity of the cholera vaccine was studied by infecting animals with a virulent strain of cholera one month and seven months after vaccination. It was found that immunomodulators increase the immunogenicity and protectivity of antigens that are part of the anti-cholera vaccine. The use of all immunopreparations increases the production of specific immunoglobulins in the serum of vaccinated experimental animals. It was shown that in the first month after vaccination, polyoxidonium most effectively stimulated the formation of antibodies, but lycopide contributed to a longer retention of anti-cholera immunoglobulins in the serum of vaccinated rabbits. The combined use of the vaccine and lycopide prevented the development of cholera in all animals taken in the experiment, including those vaccinated with a reduced dose. In the long-term post-vaccination period, this immunomodulator increased the protectiveness of the anti-cholera vaccine by three times. Polyoxidonium and derinate also increased the protective effect of the cholera vaccine, but were slightly inferior to lycopide.

Eleven (79%) of the 14 used direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs). Eight high-risk patients did not receive an anticoagulant for thromboprophylaxis; 4 of these developed VTE. No patients on anticoagulation developed a VTE. This strategy had rare minor bleeding complications. Conclusion: This quality action verifies guideline-based thromboprophylaxis in multiple myeloma and supports the benefit of pharmacy oversight in improving VTE rates. The use of DOACs in myeloma should be further explored.",

Methods: MICs were determined against a total of 30 clinical isolates of C. neoformans by the microdilution method following the CLSI M27-A3 guidelines and by the checkerboard method. Results: Tacrolimus and cyclosporine A showed in vitro activity against cryptococcal isolates. The combination of amphotericin B with cyclosporine A or tacrolimus was synergistic against 90% and 30% of isolates, respectively. Synergism was also observed with the combination of fluconazole with cyclosporine A or tacrolimus, against 70% and 20% of isolates, respectively.

Objectives: Candida albicans is the most clinically prevalent cause of systemic fungal infections in the immunocompromised population. The biofilm-forming ability of C. albicans confers resistance to conventional antifungal agents. The main aim of this study was to investigate the antifungal effects of ethyl caffeate (EC) alone and in combination with fluconazole (FLU) against C. albicans isolates. Methods: The single and combined antifungal activities of EC and FLU were evaluated against planktonic and biofilm cells of C. albicans by the checkerboard assay, time\u00e2\u20ac\u201ckill test, crystal violet assay, live/dead staining, rhodamine 6G (R6G) efflux analysis and hydrolase activity. Monotherapy and dual therapy of EC and FLU against systemic candidiasis in a mouse model was also evaluated. Results: The results showed that EC+FLU displayed synergism in 14/26 planktonic C. albicans isolates and 11/26 C. albicans biofilms with fractional inhibitory concentration index (FICI) values ranging between 0.06\u00e2\u20ac\u201c0.49 and 0.02\u00e2\u20ac\u201c0.38, respectively. Compared with monotherapy, the combination of EC+FLU can markedly inhibit adhesion, yeast-to-hyphae transition, premature and mature biofilm metabolism, hydrolase secretion and drug efflux function of C. albicans Z1407 and Z4935. Moreover, EC can potentiate the antifungal activity of FLU to improve mouse survival, reduce fungal burden and alleviate pathological damage in both C. albicans isolates compared with EC or FLU used alone.

A new severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) causing coronavirus diseases 2019 (COVID-19), which emerged in Wuhan, China in December 2019, has spread world-wide. Currently, very few treatments are officially recommended against SARS-CoV-2. Identifying effective, low-cost antiviral drugs with limited side effects that are affordable immediately is urgently needed. Methylene blue, a synthesized thiazine dye, may be a potential antiviral drug. Antiviral activity of methylene blue used alone or in combination with several antimalarial drugs or remde-sivir was assessed against infected Vero E6 cells infected with two clinically isolated SARS-CoV-2 strains (IHUMI-3 and IHUMI-6). Effects both on viral entry in the cell and on post-entry were also investigated. After 48 h post-infection, the viral replication was estimated by RT-PCR. The median effective concentration (EC50) and 90% effective concentration (EC90) of methylene blue against IHUMI-3 were 0.41 \u00c2\u00b1 0.34 \u00c2\u00b5M and 1.85 \u00c2\u00b1 1.41 \u00c2\u00b5M, respectively; 1.06 \u00c2\u00b1 0.46 \u00c2\u00b5M and 5.68 \u00c2\u00b1 1.83 \u00c2\u00b5M against IHUMI-6.

The emergence of metallo-\u00ce\u00b2-lactamase (MBL)-producing Enterobacterales, mainly New Delhi metallo-\u00ce\u00b2-lactamase (NDM), represents a clinical threat due to the limited therapeutic alternatives. Aztreonam (AZT) is stable to MBLs, but most MBL-producing Enterobacterales isolates usually co-harbour other \u00ce\u00b2-lactamases that confer resistance to AZT and, consequently, its use is restricted in these isolates. We compared the ability of sulbactam (SUL), tazobactam (TAZ), clavulanic acid (CLA) and avibactam (AVI) to restore the AZT activity in MBL-producing AZT-resistant Enterobacterales isolates. A collection of 64 NDM-producing AZT-resistant Enterobacterales from five hospitals in Buenos Aires city, Argentina, were studied during the period July\u00e2\u20ac\u201cDecember 2020. MICs were determined using the agar dilution method with Mueller\u00e2\u20ac\u201cHinton agar according to Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) recommendations.

Background: Artemisinin-based combination therapy (ACT) has been the recommended first-line treatment for uncomplicated malaria in Mozambique since 2006, with artemether\u00e2\u20ac\u201clumefantrine (AL) and amodiaquine\u00e2\u20ac\u201cartesunate (AS\u00e2\u20ac\u201cAQ) as the first choice. To assess efficacy of currently used ACT, an in vivo therapeutic efficacy study was conducted. Methods: The study was conducted in four sentinel sites: Montepuez, Moatize, Mopeia and Massinga. Patients between 6 and 59\u00c2\u00a0months old with uncomplicated Plasmodium falciparum malaria (2000\u00e2\u20ac\u201c200,000\u00c2\u00a0parasites/\u00c2\u00b5l) were enrolled between February and September of 2018, assigned to either an AL or AS\u00e2\u20ac\u201cAQ treatment arm, and monitored for 28\u00c2\u00a0days. A Bayesian algorithm was applied to differentiate recrudescence from new infection using genotyping data of seven neutral microsatellites. Uncorrected and PCR-corrected efficacy results at day 28 were calculated. Results: Totals of 368 and 273 patients were enrolled in the AL and AS\u00e2\u20ac\u201cAQ arms, respectively. Of these, 9.5% (35/368) and 5.1% (14/273) were lost to follow-up in the AL and AS\u00e2\u20ac\u201cAQ arms, respectively. There were 48 and 3 recurrent malaria infections (late clinical and late parasitological failures) in the AL and AS\u00e2\u20ac\u201cAQ arms, respectively. The day 28 uncorrected efficacy was 85.6% (95% confidence interval (CI) 81.3\u00e2\u20ac\u201c89.2%) for AL and 98.8% (95% CI 96.7\u00e2\u20ac\u201c99.8%) for AS\u00e2\u20ac\u201cAQ, whereas day 28 PCR-corrected efficacy was 97.9% (95% CI 95.6\u00e2\u20ac\u201c99.2%) for AL and 99.6% (95% CI 97.9\u00e2\u20ac\u201c100%) for AS\u00e2\u20ac\u201cAQ. Molecular testing confirmed that 87.4% (42/48) and 33.3% (1/3) of participants with a recurrent malaria infection in the AL and AS\u00e2\u20ac\u201cAQ arms were new infections; an expected finding in a high malaria transmission area.

Background: Non-prescribed opioid use is illegal in Vietnam. People who are apprehended for use of non-prescribed opioids may be arrested and incarcerated or sent to compulsory rehabilitation centers. For those on medication to treat opioid use disorder (MOUD), incarceration in either setting may disrupt treatment. This study estimates the effects of incarceration and compulsory rehabilitation on MOUD and HIV treatment outcomes in Vietnam. Methods: Data are from a clinical trial testing the effects of MOUD on HIV viral suppression in six Vietnamese HIV clinics. Participants were assessed quarterly for 12 months. We assessed the associations between incarceration or compulsory rehabilitation during months 0\u00e2\u20ac\u201c9 and study outcomes of receipt of MOUD, HIV clinic engagement, and antiretroviral therapy prescription during months 9\u00e2\u20ac\u201c12, among those who were released by month 9 of the study, using logistic regression and zero-inflated negative binomial models. Results: At nine months, 25 of 258 participants (9.7%) were incarcerated or sent to compulsory rehabilitation at least once and completed the month 9 assessment. Of those, 19 (76.0%) did not receive MOUD in months 9 through 12. Both incarceration and compulsory rehabilitation were negatively associated with subsequent receipt of MOUD (aOR = 0.05, 95% CI = (0.01, 0.24); 0.14 (0.04, 0.50), respectively) and HIV clinic engagement (aOR = 0.13, 95% CI = (0.03, 0.71); 0.09 (0.02, 0.39), respectively). In the final three months of the study, participants who were incarcerated had 42.5 fewer days of MOUD (95% CI = 23.1, 61.9), and participants in compulsory rehabilitation had 46.1 fewer days of MOUD (95% CI = 33.8, 58.4) than those not incarcerated or in compulsory rehabilitation. Conclusion: Our findings suggest that both incarceration and compulsory rehabilitation disrupt MOUD and HIV treatment among people with HIV and Opioid Use Disorder in Vietnam.

Background: Metabolic acidosis is a major complication of critical illness. However, its current epidemiology and its treatment with sodium bicarbonate given to correct metabolic acidosis in the ICU are poorly understood. Method: This was an international retrospective observational study in 18 ICUs in Australia, Japan, and Taiwan. Adult patients were consecutively screened, and those with early metabolic acidosis (pH < 7.3 and a Base Excess < \u00e2\u20ac\u201c4\u00c2\u00a0mEq/L, within 24-h of ICU admission) were included. Screening continued until 10 patients who received and 10 patients who did not receive sodium bicarbonate in the first 24\u00c2\u00a0h (early bicarbonate therapy) were included at each site. The primary outcome was ICU mortality, and the association between sodium bicarbonate and the clinical outcomes were assessed using regression analysis with generalized linear mixed model. Results: We screened 9437 patients. Of these, 1292 had early metabolic acidosis (14.0%). Early sodium bicarbonate was given to 18.0% (233/1292) of these patients. Dosing, physiological, and clinical outcome data were assessed in 360 patients. The median dose of sodium bicarbonate in the first 24\u00c2\u00a0h was 110\u00c2\u00a0mmol, which was not correlated with bodyweight or the severity of metabolic acidosis. Patients who received early sodium bicarbonate had higher APACHE III scores, lower pH, lower base excess, lower PaCO2, and a higher lactate and received higher doses of vasopressors. After adjusting for confounders, the early administration of sodium bicarbonate was associated with an adjusted odds ratio (aOR) of 0.85 (95% CI, 0.44 to 1.62) for ICU mortality. In patients with vasopressor dependency, early sodium bicarbonate was associated with higher mean arterial pressure at 6\u00c2\u00a0h and an aOR of 0.52 (95% CI, 0.22 to 1.19) for ICU mortality. Conclusions: Early metabolic acidosis is common in critically ill patients.

Introduction: The incidence of Ifosfamide-induced encephalopathy (IIE) ranges from 5-30%. Aprepitant and fosaprepitant may increase the risk of IIE; however, data is limited. The objective of this study was to characterize the incidence of IIE in patients receiving concomitant fosaprepitant. Methods: This single-center, retrospective chart review included adult patients diagnosed with sarcoma who received at least one administration of high dose ifosfamide (\u00e2\u2030\u00a51800mg/m2) and fosaprepitant between January 2017 and June 2018. The primary endpoint was the percentage of patient cycles in which IIE was experienced. Secondary endpoints included characterization of IIE management strategies, time to IIE resolution, and the incidence of IIE upon ifosfamide re-challenge. Subgroup analyses were performed to assess whether the following variables predisposed a patient to neurotoxicity: elevated serum creatinine, hypoalbuminemia, metabolic acidosis, hyperbilirubinemia, shorter infusion time, and higher body mass index. The role of CYP2B6 inhibitors and prior cisplatin use were also examined. Results: Fifty-one patients who received 215 total cycles of ifosfamide were included. Twenty (9.3%) patient cycles included documented evidence of IIE. The most common management strategies were to prolong the infusion time and administer methylene blue. The mean time to resolution of IIE was 2.58 days. The incidence of secondary IIE upon re-challenge was 26.3%.

The frequency of analgesic use in 38- and 50-year-old women was about 26% in 2004\u00e2\u20ac\u201c2005 and 58% in 2016\u00e2\u20ac\u201c2017. 28% of women who reported high mental stress in 2004\u00e2\u20ac\u201c2005 used analgesics, compared to 60% in 2016\u00e2\u20ac\u201c2017. There were no associations between self-perceived mental stress and the use of analgesics. Conclusion: The higher use of analgesics among midlife women in 2016\u00e2\u20ac\u201c2017 is in line with global findings and could be due to increased availability in Sweden of over the counter medicines. The impact of mental stress on analgesic use found previously by other researchers was not confirmed. However, medicine use as a potential coping strategy is an important public health issue that needs to be further explored.",

Despite HER2-targeted cancer treatments have provided considerable clinical benefits, resistance to HER2-targeted agents will inevitably develop. Targeting non-oncogene vulnerabilities including endoplasmic reticulum (EnR) stress has emerged as an attractive alternative approach to improve the efficacy of existing targeted cancer therapies. In the current study, we find that Melatonin sensitizes HER2-positive breast cancer cells to the dual tyrosine kinase inhibitor Lapatinib in vitro. Mechanistically, Melatonin enhances the cytotoxic effects of Lapatinib through promoting excessive EnR stress-induced unfolded protein response (UPR) and ROS overaccumulation. Consistently, the antioxidant N-acetylcysteine remarkably reverses the effects of the drug combination on ROS production, DNA damage and cytotoxicity. Furthermore, Melatonin significantly enhances the anti-tumor effect of Lapatinib in an HCC1954 xenograft model. Meanwhile, Lapatinib resistant HER2-positive breast cancer cells (LapR) display lower basal expression levels of UPR genes and enhanced tolerance to EnR stress with attenuated response to Brefeldin A and Tunicamycin. Importantly, Melatonin also increases the sensitivity of HCC1954 LapR cells to Lapatinib.

Background: Infantile eosinophilic pustular folliculitis (I-EPF) is a rare disease characterized by pruritic vesicles and sterile pustules on the erythematous surface of the scalp and facial localization, usually seen in the neonatal period. It is essential to show the presence of dense eosinophils in the diagnosis of pustules. Histopathological examination of the hair follicles by eosinophils infiltration is determined. Aim: Here, we reported a 5-month-old baby boy diagnosed infantile eosinophilic pustular folliculitis. Patient: A 5-month-old baby boy was consulted to our polyclinic by his family because of pustules on the scalp, face, and neck developing in two week after birth. In dermatological examination, the pustular lesions of 1-2 mm in diameter on the scalp, face, and neck on an erythematous background were determined. Results: There was no growth in the culture taken from the pustule. In the laboratory tests of the patient; upon detection of eosinophilia in the hemogram. The eosinophil count at the patient's first admission was 1.48\u00c2\u00a0K/\u00ce\u00bcl. (0.05 0.50). Eosinophil count was 0.02\u00c2\u00a0K/\u00ce\u00bcl after treatment. It was decreased. The patient was evaluated for other pustular dermatoses. In the differential diagnosis of the patient; causing bacterial/non-bacterial pustulosis were included. Bacterial culture was negative. Conclusion: Eosinophilic folliculitis defines as a group of papulopustular diseases with unknown etiology characterized histologically by eosinophilic infiltrates.

Introduction: Among children with infantile spasms (ISs), those with trisomy 21 (T21) and those with normal development at onset and no identifiable etiology (previously referred to as idiopathic) are expected to have relatively favorable outcomes. The study objective is to determine if differences exist in treatment response, relapse, and subsequent epilepsy between these two groups when vigabatrin is used as first-line treatment. Methods: In this retrospective study, patients were classified into the following groups and clinical features were compared: T21 (n = 24) and IS with normal development at onset and no identified etiology (n = 40; control group). Results: There was no significant difference in the age of IS onset, sex distribution, or treatment lag between the groups. The T21 compared to the control group required a higher mean number of anti-seizure therapies (3.6 vs. 1.9, p < 0.001), had more relapses [10 (42%) vs. 4 (10%), p < 0.005)], and had higher risk of subsequent epilepsy [11 (46%) vs. 8 (20%), p < 0.003]. Relapses were often delayed in the T21 group, with a mean of 8 months after IS cessation. Conclusion: Our results differ from most studies using steroids as first-line treatment where the groups were shown to have similar treatment response and T21 patients had a low risk of relapse and subsequent epilepsy. Therefore, our results suggest that vigabatrin as first-line treatment in T21 with IS may be less favorable than steroids.\n",

Recently, the battery security issue receives widespread attention.

In this work, commercial polyethylene separators are coated with a Al2O3 composite organic silicone - acrylic acid gel layer and the electrochemical performance are characterized. The coated battery separator (PEAE-5) exhibits the lowest charge transfer resistance and increases the electrochemical stability window to 5.3 V, since the silicone exhibits oxidation resistance and the acrylic provides flexibility in polar electrolyte solvents. Subsequently, the battery separator is punched in cycles to simulate fatigue failure of the separator under external compression. The results indicate that the separator (PEAE-5) coated with a 5% solid content of organic silicone - acrylic acid emulsion exhibits the best combined physical-mechanical and electrochemical properties, maintaining nearly 80% of the original cycling performance after 50 cycles of compression.

Purpose: Inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) are frequently used to treat chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) outside the current recommendations. Our aim was to describe ICS use in COPD patients and to identify factors associated with ICS use among COPD patients treated within primary care in Spain. Patients and Methods: This was a cross-sectional, non-interventional and multicenter study of patients with COPD treated in primary care. Patient characteristics and exacerbations were described in terms of ICS use among the overall cohort, and among those with spirometry confirmed COPD (post-bronchodilator forced expiratory volume in 1 second [FEV1]/forced vital capacity [FVC] ratio <70%). Multivariable logistic regression was used to identify factors associated with ICS use. Results: A total of 901 patients were included, of which 47.9% (n = 432) were treated with ICS. A total of 240 patients (26.6%) experienced moderate/severe exacerbations in the prior year, while 309 (34.3%) during the previous two years. History of asthma totaled 11.6% (n = 105). The most frequent phenotype was non-exacerbator (51.6%), and the proportion of patient with moderate or severe exacerbations was significantly higher among ICS treated patients compared to non-treated: 37.5% versus 16.6% during the previous year (p < 0.001), and 46.8% versus 22.8% during the previous 2-years (p < 0.001), respectively.

Importance: Decreases in future lung function are a hallmark of preterm birth, but studies for management of decreased lung function are limited. Objective: To determine whether 12 weeks of treatment with inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) alone or in combination with long-acting \u00ce\u00b22agonists (LABA) improves spirometry and exercise capacity in school-aged preterm-born children who had percent predicted forced expiratory volume in 1 second (%FEV1) less than or equal to 85% compared with inhaled placebo treatment.

Preterm-born children (age, 7-12 years; gestation \u00e2\u2030\u00a434 weeks at birth) who did not have clinically significant congenital, cardiopulmonary, or neurodevelopmental abnormalities underwent spirometry, exercise testing, and measurement of fractional exhaled nitric oxide before and after treatment. A total of 144 preterm-born children at the Children's Hospital for Wales in Cardiff, UK, were identified and enrolled between July 1, 2017, and August 31, 2019. Interventions: Each child was randomized to 1 of 3 cohorts: fluticasone propionate, 50 \u00ce\u00bcg, with placebo; fluticasone propionate, 50 \u00ce\u00bcg, with salmeterol, 25 \u00ce\u00bcg; or placebo inhalers, all given as 2 puffs twice daily for 12 weeks. Children receiving preexisting ICS treatment underwent washout prior to randomization to ICS or ICS/LABA. Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary outcome was between-group differences assessed by adjusted pretreatment and posttreatment differences of %FEV1using analysis of covariance. Intention-to-treat analysis was conducted. Results: Of 144 preterm-born children who were identified with %FEV1less than or equal to 85%, 53 were randomized. Treatment allocation was 20 children receiving ICS (including 5 with prerandomization ICS), 19 children receiving ICS/LABA (including 4 with prerandomization ICS), and 14 children receiving placebo. The mean (SD) age of children was 10.8 (1.2) years, and 29 of the randomized children (55%) were female. The posttreatment %FEV1was adjusted for sex, gestation, bronchopulmonary dysplasia, intrauterine growth restriction, pretreatment corticosteroid status, treatment group, and pretreatment values. Posttreatment adjusted means for %FEV1, using analysis of covariance, were 7.7% (95% CI, -0.27% to 15.72%; P =.16) higher in the ICS group and 14.1% (95% CI, 7.3% to 21.0%; P =.002) higher in the ICS/LABA group compared with the placebo group. Active treatment decreased the fractional exhaled nitric oxide and improved postexercise bronchodilator response but did not improve exercise capacity. One child developed cough when starting inhaler treatment; no other adverse events reported during the trial could be attributed to the inhaler treatment.

Objective: To investigate whether the use of iEPO will lead to similar rates of severe/grade 3 primary graft dysfunction (PGD-3) after adult LT when compared with use of iNO. Design, Setting, and Participants: This health system-funded, randomized, blinded (to participants, clinicians, data managers, and the statistician), parallel-designed, equivalence clinical trial included 201 adult patients who underwent single or bilateral LT between May 30, 2017, and March 21, 2020. Patients were grouped into 5 strata according to key prognostic clinical features and randomized per stratum to receive either iNO or iEPO at the time of LT via 1:1 treatment allocation. Interventions: Treatment with iNO or iEPO initiated in the operating room before lung allograft reperfusion and administered continously until cessation criteria met in the intensive care unit (ICU). Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary outcome was PGD-3 development at 24, 48, or 72 hours after LT. The primary analysis was for equivalence using a two one-sided test (TOST) procedure (90% CI) with a margin of 19% for between-group PGD-3 risk difference. Secondary outcomes included duration of mechanical ventilation, hospital and ICU lengths of stay, incidence and severity of acute kidney injury, postoperative tracheostomy placement, and in-hospital, 30-day, and 90-day mortality rates. An intention-to-treat analysis was performed for the primary and secondary outcomes, supplemented by per-protocol analysis for the primary outcome. Results: A total of 201 randomized patients met eligibility criteria at the time of LT (129 men [64.2%]). In the intention-to-treat population, 103 patients received iEPO and 98 received iNO. The primary outcome occurred in 46 of 103 patients (44.7%) in the iEPO group and 39 of 98 (39.8%) in the iNO group, leading to a risk difference of 4.9% (TOST 90% CI, -6.4% to 16.2%; P =.02 for equivalence).

Exposure to particulate matter (PM) is a known mediator of inflammation and CVD and is reported to promote dysbiosis and decreased intestinal integrity. However, the role of inhaled traffic-generated PM on the gut microbiome and its corresponding systemic effects are not well-characterized. Thus, we investigated the hypothesis that exposure to inhaled diesel exhaust particles (DEP) alters the gut microbiome and promotes microbial-related inflammation and CVD biomarkers. 4\u00e2\u20ac\u201c6-week-old male C57Bl/6 mice on either a low-fat (LF, 10% fat) or high-fat (HF, 45% fat) diet were exposed via oropharyngeal aspiration to 35\u00c2\u00a0\u00ce\u00bcg DEP suspended in 35\u00c2\u00a0\u00ce\u00bcl saline or saline only (CON) 2x/week for 30\u00c2\u00a0days.

Berberine hydrochloride (BH), an active component of Coptis chinensis and other plant taxa, has broad antimicrobial activity and may be useful for the treatment of Candida infections. In this study, the mechanisms underlying the inhibitory effect of BH against Candida albicans were evaluated, with a focus on the high-osmolarity glycerol mitogen-activated protein kinase (HOG-MAPK) pathway, which regulates multiple physiological functions. BH (256 and 64 \u00ce\u00bcg ml\u00e2\u02c6\u20191) significantly increased intracellular glycerol and ROS levels in C. albicans, inhibited germ tube and hyphal formation, and increased chitin and \u00ce\u00b2\u00e2\u02c6\u20191,3-glucan exposure on the cell wall. The inhibitory effect of BH was positively correlated with its concentration, and the inhibitory effect of 256 \u00ce\u00bcg ml\u00e2\u02c6\u20191 BH was greater than that of 4 \u00ce\u00bcg ml\u00e2\u02c6\u20191 fluconazole (FLC). Furthermore, RT-PCR analysis showed that 256 and 64 \u00ce\u00bcg ml\u00e2\u02c6\u20191 BH altered the HOG-MAPK pathway in C. albicans. In particular, the upregulation of the core genes, SLN1, SSK2, HOG1, and PBS2 may affect the expression of key downstream factors related to glycerol synthesis and osmotic pressure (GPD1), ROS accumulation (ATP11 and SOD2), germ tube and hyphal formation (HWP1), and cell wall integrity (CHS3 and GSC1).

Ethnopharmacological relevance: The modified gamgil-tang (GGX) is a mixture of four herbal medicine including Platycodi Radix, Glycyrrhizae Radix, Lonicerae Flos and Mori Radicis Cortex which has been traditionally used to treat lung and airway diseases to relieve symptoms like sore throat, cough, and sputum in Korea. Its major component chlorogenic acid had been reported to have antioxidant, antibacterial, hepatoprotective, cardioprotective, anti-inflammatory, antiviral, and anti-microbial activity. Aim of the study: To identify the inhibitory effect of GGX in a particulate matter (PM) induced lung injury mouse model. Materials and methods: We evaluated NO production, the release of TNF-\u00ce\u00b1 and IFN-\u00ce\u00b3 in PM-induced MH-S cells, and the number of neutrophils, immune cell subtypes, and the secretion of TNF-\u00ce\u00b1, IL-17, CXCL-1, MIP-2 in the PM-stimulated mouse model to assess the inhibitory effect of GGX against PM. In addition, as exposure to PM increases respiratory symptoms, typically cough and sputum, we attempted to evaluate the antitussive and expectorant activities of GGX. Results: Our study provided evidence that GGX has inhibitory effects in PM-induced lung injury by inhibiting the increase in neutrophil and inflammatory mediators, deactivating T cells, and ameliorating lung tissue damage. Notably, GGX reduced PM-induced neutrophilic inflammation by attenuating the number of neutrophils and regulating the secretion of neutrophil-related cytokines and chemokines, such as TNF-\u00ce\u00b1, IL-17, MIP2, and CXCL-1. In addition, GGX demonstrated an antitussive activity by significantly reducing citric acid-induced cough frequency and delaying the latent period and expectorant activities by the increased phenol red secretion compared to the control group.

Background There was no clear evidence whether the initial dose of enzalutamide affects the incidence of adverse events (AEs), and oncological outcome in patients with castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC). Methods The clinical charts of 233 patients with CRPC treated with enzalutamide were reviewed retrospectively. After 1:3 propensity score matching (PSM), 124 patients were divided into a reduced dose group and a standard dose group, and the prostate specific antigen (PSA) response and the incidence of AEs were compared. Results 190 patients with CRPC initiated with standard dose enzalutamide were younger and better performance status compared with 43 patients beginning with reduced dose. After PSM, the baseline characteristics were not different between the standard and the reduced dose group. In the PSM cohort, the PSA response rate was significantly lower in the reduced dose group than in the standard dose group (-66.3% and -87.4%, p = 0.02).

Aim: To determine the effect of insulin on the resistance of subcutaneous tissue to the flow of infusion fluids. Materials and methods: Thirty subjects with type 1 diabetes wore two Accu-Chek Spirit Combo insulin pumps with Accu-Chek FlexLink infusion sets (Roche Diabetes Care, Mannheim, Germany) for 7 days. One pump was filled with insulin aspart (Novo Nordisk, Bagsvaerd, Denmark) and used for continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII). The other pump was filled with insulin diluting medium (IDM; Novo Nordisk) and used to deliver IDM subcutaneously at rates identical to those employed for CSII. Both infusion sites were assessed daily by measuring the pressure required to infuse various bolus amounts of IDM. Results: On day 1, maximum pressure (Pmax) and tissue flow resistance (TFR; calculated from measured pressure profiles) were similar for both infusion sites (P > 0.20). During the subsequent study days, the Pmax and TFR values observed at the IDM infusion site remained at levels comparable to those seen on day 1 (P > 0.13). However, at the site of CSII, Pmax and TFR progressively increased with CSII duration. By the end of day 7, Pmax and TFR reached 25.8 */2.11 kPa (geometric mean */geometric standard deviation) and 8.64 */3.48 kPa*s/\u00ce\u00bcL, respectively, representing a remarkable 3.5- and 20.6-fold increase relative to the respective Pmax and TFR values observed on day 1 (P < 0.001).

            "premise": "Insulin receptor cleavage induced by estrogen impairs insulin signaling. Introduction Soluble insulin receptor (sIR), which is the ectodomain of insulin receptor (IR), is present in human plasma. Plasma sIR levels are positively correlated with blood glucose levels and negatively correlated with insulin sensitivity. An in vitro model of IR cleavage shows that extracellular calpain 2 directly cleaves IR, which generates sIR, and sequential cleavage of the IR\u00ce\u00b2 subunit by 3-secretase impairs insulin signaling in a glucose concentration-dependent manner. Nevertheless, sIR levels vary among subjects with normal glucose levels. Research design and methods We examined sIR levels of pregnant women throughout gestation. Using an in vitro model, we also investigated the molecular mechanisms of IR cleavage induced by estradiol. Results In pregnant women, sIR levels were positively correlated with estrogen levels and significantly increased at late pregnancy independent of glucose levels. Using an in vitro model, estrogen elicited IR cleavage and impaired cellular insulin signaling. Estradiol-induced IR cleavage was inhibited by targeting of calpain 2 and 3-secretase. Estrogen exerted these biological effects via G protein-coupled estrogen receptor, and its selective ligand upregulated calpain 2 expression and promoted exosome secretion, which significantly increased extracellular calpain 2. Simultaneous stimulation of estrogen and high glucose levels had a synergic effect on IR cleavage. Metformin prevented calpain 2 release in exosomes and restored insulin signaling impaired by estrogen. Conclusions Estradiol-induced IR cleavage causes cellular insulin resistance, and its molecular mechanisms are shared with those by high glucose levels. sIR levels at late pregnancy are significantly elevated along with estrogen levels. Therefore, estradiol-induced IR cleavage is preserved in pregnant women and could be part of the etiology of insulin resistance in gestational diabetes mellitus and overt diabetes during pregnancy.\n",

Background: Lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) remains a lethal disease worldwide, with numerous studies exploring its potential prognostic markers using traditional RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) data. However, it cannot detect the exact cellular and molecular changes in tumor cells. This study aimed to construct a prognostic model for LUAD using single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) and traditional RNA-seq data. Methods: Bulk RNA-seq data were downloaded from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database. LUAD scRNA-seq data were acquired from Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database. The uniform manifold approximation and projection (UMAP) was used for dimensionality reduction and cluster identification. Weighted Gene Correlation Network Analysis (WGCNA) was utilized to identify key modules and differentially expressed genes (DEGs). The non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF) algorithm was used to identify different subtypes based on DEGs. The Cox regression analysis was used to develop the prognostic model. The characteristics of mutation landscape, immune status, and immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) related genes between different risk groups were also investigated. Results: scRNA-seq data of four samples were integrated to identify 13 clusters and 9cell types. After applying differential analysis, NK cells, bladder epithelial cells, and bronchial epithelial cells were identified as significant cell types. Overall, 329 DEGs were selected for prognostic model construction through differential analysis and WGCNA. Besides, NMF identified two clusters based on DEGs in the TCGA cohort, with distinct prognosis and immune characteristics being observed. We developed a prognostic model based on the expression levels of six DEGs. A higher risk score was significantly correlated with poor survival outcomes but was associated with a more frequent TP53 mutation rate, higher tumor mutation burden (TMB), and up-regulation of PD-L1. Two independent external validation cohorts were also adopted to verify our results, with consistent results observed in them. Conclusion: This study constructed and validated a prognostic model for LUAD by integrating 10\u00c3\u2014 scRNA-seq and bulk RNA-seq data.

Aim: To provide a clinical practice guideline for the use of testosterone including identification of patients, laboratory testing, dosing, post-treatment monitoring, and follow-up care in women with hypoactive sexual desire disorder (HSDD). Methods: The International Society for the Study of Women's Sexual Health appointed a multidisciplinary panel of experts who performed a literature review of original research, meta-analyses, review papers, and consensus guidelines regarding testosterone use in women. Consensus was reached using a modified Delphi method. Outcomes: A clinically useful guideline following a biopsychosocial assessment and treatment approach for the safe and efficacious use of testosterone in women with HSDD was developed including measurement, indications, formulations, prescribing, dosing, monitoring, and follow-up. Results: Although the Global Position Statement endorses testosterone therapy for only postmenopausal women, limited data also support the use in late reproductive age premenopausal women, consistent with the International Society for the Study of Women's Sexual Health Process of Care for the Management of HSDD. Systemic transdermal testosterone is recommended for women with HSDD not primarily related to modifiable factors or comorbidities such as relationship or mental health problems. Current available research supports a moderate therapeutic benefit. Safety data show no serious adverse events with physiologic testosterone use, but long-term safety has not been established. Before initiation of therapy, clinicians should provide an informed consent. Shared decision-making involves a comprehensive discussion of off-label use, as well as benefits and risks. A total testosterone level should not be used to diagnose HSDD, but as a baseline for monitoring. Government-approved transdermal male formulations can be used cautiously with dosing appropriate for women. Patients should be assessed for signs of androgen excess and total testosterone levels monitored to maintain concentrations in the physiologic premenopausal range. Compounded products cannot be recommended because of the lack of efficacy and safety data. Clinical implications: This clinical practice guideline provides standards for safely prescribing testosterone to women with HSDD, including identification of appropriate patients, dosing, and monitoring. Strengths and limitations: This evidence-based guideline builds on a recently published comprehensive meta-analysis and the Global Position Statement endorsed by numerous societies.

Results: Of the 341 eyes treated with 1,292 consecutive infusions of IAC as primary or secondary therapy for retinoblastoma, Kaplan-Meier 5-year estimates of globe salvage was 74%. Of those treated with IAC as primary therapy (n = 160 eyes; 655 infusions), 5-year globe salvage overall was 76%: and more specifically, 100% for groups B and C, 86% for group D, and 55% for group E. Of those treated with IAC as secondary therapy (n = 207 eyes; 859 infusions), 5-year globe salvage was 71%. Comparative analysis by race and sex demonstrated no differences in outcomes, but analysis by age revealed that younger patients had a higher rate of globe salvage (77% vs 72%; P < 0.001). Complications (per catheterization) included retina ischemia (1%), choroidal ischemia (1%), neovascularization of the disk, retina, iris (NVI), glaucoma (about 1% each), and central/peripheral systemic ischemia (<1%). Younger patients showed less NVI (P = 0.028), white patients showed less retinal ischemia (P = 0.037), and no difference by sex. There were no patients with metastatic disease or death. Conclusions: Our results suggest that IAC provides substantial tumor control for advanced and/or recurrent retinoblastoma with a high rate of globe salvage and few complications. There was little difference in outcomes per age, race, and sex.",

Background: Given the inadequate control of pain in patients with the trauma that refer to the emergency departments, the rapid onset of action of intranasal administration in pain management, and the avoidance of administering opioid medications, the present study aimed at evaluating the effect of intranasal ketamine versus intranasal fentanyl on pain management in isolated traumatic patients. Materials and Methods: The current study was performed on 125 patients that were divided into the following three groups: control group (n = 41), 1 mg/kg intranasal ketamine group (n = 40), and 1 \u00ce\u00bcg/kg intranasal fentanyl group (n = 44). Then pain scores, heart rate, respiratory rate, blood pressure, and oxygen saturation were recorded at baseline, 5, 10, 15, 30, and 40 min after the intervention. Results: Visual analog scale (VAS) scores of patients in the intranasal ketamine group 5 and 10 min after the intervention were 61.50 \u00c2\u00b1 20.45 and 55.00 \u00c2\u00b1 21.96, respectively.

Background With the essential role of interleukin-1 signaling in cancer-related inflammation, IL-1R1, the main receptor for both IL-1\u00ce\u00b1 and IL-1\u00ce\u00b2, demonstrated therapeutic potential in several types of cancer, which has been put into clinical trials. However, the expression profile and critical role of IL-1R1 in gastric cancer (GC) remain obscure. This study aimed to investigate the prognostic significance of IL-1R1 expression and its predictive value for chemotherapy and immunotherapy in GC. Methods The study enrolled three cohorts, consisting of 409 tumor microarray specimens of GC patients from Zhongshan Hospital, 341 transcriptional data from The Cancer Genome Atlas, and 45 transcriptional data from patients treated with pembrolizumab. IL-1R1 mRNA expression was directly acquired from public datasets, and we also detected IL-1R1 protein expression on tumor microarray by immunohistochemistry. Finally, the associations of IL-1R1 expression with clinical outcomes, immune contexture, and genomic features were analyzed. Results High IL-1R1 expression predicted poor prognosis and inferior responsiveness to both 5-fluorouracil-based adjuvant chemotherapy (ACT) and immune checkpoint blockade (ICB). IL-1R1 fostered an immunosuppressive microenvironment characterized by upregulated M2 macrophages and exhausted CD8 + T cells infiltration. Moreover, the expression of IL-1R1 was intrinsically linked to genomic alterations associated with targeted therapies in GC.

Background & Aims: Nourishment of gut microbiota via consumption of fermentable fiber promotes gut health and guards against metabolic syndrome. In contrast, how dietary fiber impacts type 1 diabetes is less clear. Methods: To examine impact of dietary fibers on development of type 1 diabetes in the streptozotocin (STZ)-induced and spontaneous non-obese diabetes (NOD) models, mice were fed grain-based chow (GBC) or compositionally defined diets enriched with a fermentable fiber (inulin) or an insoluble fiber (cellulose). Spontaneous (NOD mice) or STZ-induced (wild-type mice) diabetes was monitored. Results: Relative to GBC, low-fiber diets exacerbated STZ-induced diabetes, whereas diets enriched with inulin, but not cellulose, strongly protected against or treated it. Inulin's restoration of glycemic control prevented loss of adipose depots, while reducing food and water consumption. Inulin normalized pancreatic function and markedly enhanced insulin sensitivity. Such amelioration of diabetes was associated with alterations in gut microbiota composition and was eliminated by antibiotic administration. Pharmacologic blockade of fermentation reduced inulin's beneficial impact on glycemic control, indicating a role for short-chain fatty acids (SCFA). Furthermore, inulin's microbiota-dependent anti-diabetic effect associated with SCFA-independent restoration of interleukin 22, which was necessary and sufficient to ameliorate STZ-induced diabetes.

Methods We conducted a randomized multicenter phase II trial in patients with advanced melanoma. Patients were randomly assigned to receive either 1 mg/kg of nivolumab plus 3 mg/kg of ipilimumab or 3 mg/kg of ipilimumab every 3 weeks for up to four doses. Patients were stratified by histological subtype and prior response to PD-1 therapy. The primary clinical objective was overall response rate by week 18.

Results Objective responses were seen in 5 of 9 patients in the ipilimumab arm and 2 of 10 patients in the ipilimumab+nivolumab arm; disease control rates (DCRs) (66.7% vs 60.0%) and rates of grade 3-4 adverse events (56% vs 50%) were comparable between arms.

Introduction: In 2018, ixekizumab (80\u00c2\u00a0mg every 2\u00c2\u00a0weeks [Q2W] beyond Week 12) received approval in Japan for patients with generalized pustular psoriasis (GPP) and erythrodermic psoriasis (EP). This open-label study evaluated the efficacy and safety of ixekizumab (80\u00c2\u00a0mg Q2W from Week 12 to Week 20) in Japanese patients with GPP and EP. Methods: Seven patients with GPP and five patients with EP were enrolled. An initial dose of 160\u00c2\u00a0mg (subcutaneous [SC] injection) was followed by 80\u00c2\u00a0mg Q2W SC until Week 12. Primary endpoint assessed global improvement score (GIS) by comparing psoriatic findings, Static Physician Global Assessment, Psoriasis Area and Severity Index score, and other evaluations with those at the baseline and were graded as 1 = resolved, 2= improved, 3 = unchanged, and 4 = worsened.

Joint pain is a complex phenomenon that involves multiple endogenous mediators and pathophysiological events. In addition to nociceptive and inflammatory pain, some patients report neuropathic-like pain symptoms. Examination of arthritic joints from humans and preclinical animal models have revealed axonal damage which is likely the source of the neuropathic pain. The mediators responsible for joint peripheral neuropathy are obscure, but lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) has emerged as a leading candidate target. In the present study, male and female Wistar rats received an intra-articular injection of LPA into the right knee and allowed to recover for 28 days. Joint pain was measured by von Frey hair algesiometry, while joint pathology was determined by scoring of histological sections. Both male and female rats showed comparable degenerative changes to the LPA-treated knee including chondrocyte death, focal bone erosion, and synovitis. Mechanical withdrawal thresholds decreased by 20-30% indicative of secondary allodynia in the affected limb; however, there was no significant difference in pain sensitivity between the sexes. Treatment of LPA animals with the neuropathic pain drug amitriptyline reduced joint pain for over 2 hours with no sex differences being observed.

Eligibility criteria for participants Aged 18 or older with current suicidal ideation, admitted to hospital voluntarily. Exclusion criteria included a history of schizophrenia or other psychotic disorders, substance dependence, and contraindications for ketamine. Participants 156 participants were recruited and randomised to placebo (n=83) or ketamine (n=73), stratified by centre and diagnosis: bipolar, depressive, or other disorders. Intervention Two 40 minute intravenous infusions of ketamine (0.5 mg/kg) or placebo (saline) were administered at baseline and 24 hours, in addition to usual treatment. Main outcome measures The primary outcome was the rate of patients in full suicidal remission at day 3, according to the scale for suicidal ideation total score \u00e2\u2030\u00a43. Analyses were conducted on an intention-to-treat basis. Results More participants receiving ketamine reached full remission of suicidal ideas at day 3 than those receiving placebo: 46 (63.0%) of 83 participants in the ketamine arm and 25 (31.6%) of 73 in the placebo arm (odds ratio 3.7 (95% confidence interval 1.9 to 7.3), P<0.001). This effect differed according to the diagnosis (treatment: P<0.001; interaction: P=0.02): bipolar (odds ratio 14.1 (95% confidence interval 3.0 to 92.2), P<0.001), depressive (1.3 (0.3 to 5.2), P=0.6), or other disorders (3.7 (0.9 to 17.3, P=0.07)). Side effects were limited. No manic or psychotic symptom was seen. Moreover, a mediating effect of mental pain was found. At week 6, remission in the ketamine arm remained high, although non-significantly versus placebo (69.5% v 56.3%; odds ratio 0.8 (95% confidence interval 0.3 to 2.5), P=0.7). Conclusions The findings indicate that ketamine is rapid, safe in the short term, and has persistent benefits for acute care in suicidal patients.

Background: Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the most common malignant tumors, and many patients are diagnosed with advanced disease. The treatment of advanced liver cancer has made significant strides in recent years, owing to the practice of immunotherapy drugs. Numerous studies have been published on immunotherapy for HCC; however, no relevant bibliometric study has been published. This study aims to gain a better understanding of the current situation and to identify potential new research directions by conducting a bibliometric analysis on immunotherapy for HCC. Methods: We searched the Web of Science Core Collection (WoSCC) for articles related to immunotherapy for HCC. Three software (VOSviewer, CiteSpace, and python) were primarily used to assess the contribution and co-occurrence relationships of various countries/regions, institutes, journals, and, authors as well as to identify research hotspots and promising future trends in this research field. Results: A total of 1,641 English articles published between 2011 and 2020 were collected, with the number of articles increasing nearly every year. The majority of publications originated from China (n = 893, 54.42%), followed by the United States and Japan. The Sun Yat-sen University contributed the most publications (n = 97, 5.91%). Nakatsura Tetsuya (n = 26) and Llovet JM (n = 366) were ranked first in the top ten authors and co-cited authors. Cancer Immunology Immunotherapy was the most productive academic journal on immunotherapy for HCC [n = 46, 2.80%; impact factor (IF) 2020 = 6.9679]. Aggregation and identification of critical nodes in the co-cited network demonstrated a shift in the field of HCC immunotherapy. Initially, the hotspots were predominantly \u00e2\u20ac\u0153glypican-3\u00e2\u20ac\u009d, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153cytokine-induced killer cells\u00e2\u20ac\u009d, and \u00e2\u20ac\u0153ny-eso-1\u00e2\u20ac\u009d, while the emphasis has shifted in recent years to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153landscape\u00e2\u20ac\u009d, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153camrelizumab\u00e2\u20ac\u009d, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153combination therapy\u00e2\u20ac\u009d, and \u00e2\u20ac\u0153immune score\u00e2\u20ac\u009d.

Background: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic continues to wreak havoc on lives and ravage the world. Several vaccines have been approved for use against COVID-19; however, there may be hesitancy and negative perceptions towards vaccination, which may re-duce the willingness to be vaccinated. Further, studies assessing the current perception toward COVID-19 vaccination are scarce. This study aimed to assess community knowledge, attitudes, and perceptions regarding COVID-19 vaccines among the general population of Turkey. Methods: A cross-sectional survey was carried out among 1009 adult participants from the 13\u00e2\u20ac\u201c20 April 2021. Demographic data were collected, and attitudes and perceptions toward COVID-19 vaccines were evaluated. A multivariable regression analysis was performed to identify the factors predicting perception towards COVID-19 vaccinations. Results: Just over half of participants were male (52.6%) and the majority of respondents were aged between 30 and 39 years (33.8%). Our study revealed that 62.7% of participants had positive perceptions of COVID-19 vaccines. Logistic regression analysis results showed that older people (\u00e2\u2030\u00a530 vs. <30) were less likely to have a positive perception towards COVID-19 vaccines (OR = 0.70, 95% CI = 0.51\u00e2\u20ac\u201c0.94). We also found participants who had a previous history of influenza vaccines (OR = 2.01, 95% CI = 1.43\u00e2\u20ac\u201c2.84), bachelor\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s degrees or above (OR = 1.47, 95% CI = 1.12\u00e2\u20ac\u201c1.91), and a personal history of COVID-19 (OR = 1.58, 95% CI = 1.10\u00e2\u20ac\u201c2.26) were more likely to have a positive perception regarding COVID-19 vaccines. Conclusion: The pro-portion of the general population in Turkey who believe in COVID-19 vaccine effectiveness is not inferior to that of other countries.

Local epidemiological data are necessary for a tailored control programme, including data on population behaviour in relation to the disease. The objective of this study was to assess schistosomiasis-related knowledge, attitudes and practices in the general population of Lambar\u00c3\u00a9n\u00c3\u00a9, a small city in Gabon, in order to optimise the design and implementation of a local control programme that is tailored to need. Methods: The study was cross-sectional in nature. Eligible adults and children living in the study area who volunteered (with informed consent) to participate in the study were interviewed using standardised questionnaires, one of which was a simplified version of the primary questionnaire for participants aged 6\u00e2\u20ac\u201c13 years. Data on the participants\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 knowledge, attitudes and practices that enhance the risk for contracting schistosomiasis were collected. Results: A total of 602 participants were included. The mean (\u00c2\u00b1 standard deviation) age was 21.2 (\u00c2\u00b1 15.0) years, the female:male gender ratio was 1.6 and 289 (48%) participants completed the simplified version the questionnaire. Of the 602 participants, 554 (92%) reported past or current contact with freshwater, 218 (36%) reported a history of a diagnosis of schistosomiasis and 193 (32%) reported past intake of praziquantel medication. The overall levels of knowledge and adequate attitudes toward schistosomiasis among young adults and adults were 68 and 73%, respectively. The proportion of participants pursuing risk-enhancing practices (REP) was 60% among the whole study population. Location was significantly associated with differences in knowledge and REP levels. A history of confirmed schistosomiasis and larger family size were significantly associated with an increase in good knowledge and REP levels. However, the indication of freshwater-associated activities was only associated with a significant increase in the REP level.

Citrulline, a functional amino acid, has been reported to stimulate muscle synthesis and to function with a prebiotic-like action with certain Lactobacillus strains. The aim of this study was to investigate the potential synergistic effect of combining L. helveticus and citrulline on protection against damage induced by dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) in a mouse model. 6-week-old male C57BL/6J mice were fed with DSS water and randomly divided for administering with different milk treatments: 1) plain milk (control or DSS control), 2) 1% (w/v) citrulline enriched milk (Cit_milk), 3) milk fermented with L. helveticus (LHFM) and 4) DSS+milk fermented with L. helveticus with 1% (w/v) citrulline (Cit_LHFM).

The growth hormone secretagogue receptor (GHSR) signals in response to ghrelin, but also acts via ligand-independent mechanisms that include either constitutive activation or interaction with other G protein-coupled receptors, such as the dopamine 2 receptor (D2R). A key target of GHSR in neurons is voltage-gated calcium channels type 2.2 (CaV2.2). Recently, the liver-expressed antimicrobial peptide 2 (LEAP2) was recognized as a novel GHSR ligand, but the mechanism of action of LEAP2 on GHSR is not well understood. Here, we investigated the role of LEAP2 on the canonical and non-canonical modes of action of GHSR on CaV2.2 function. Using a heterologous expression system and patch-clamp recordings, we found that LEAP2 impairs the reduction of CaV2.2 currents induced by ghrelin-evoked and constitutive GHSR activities, acting as a GHSR antagonist and inverse agonist, respectively. We also found that LEAP2 prevents GHSR from modulating the effects of D2R signaling on CaV2.2 currents, and that the GHSR-binding N-terminal region LEAP2 underlies these effects. Using purified labeled receptors assembled into lipid nanodiscs and Forster Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET) assessments, we found that the N-terminal region of LEAP2 stabilizes an inactive conformation of GHSR that is dissociated from Gq protein and, consequently, reverses the effect of GHSR on D2R-dependent Gi activation. Thus, our results provide critical molecular insights into the mechanism mediating LEAP2 modulation of GHSR.",

Objective Our goals were to evaluate the antitumour efficacy of Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG (LGG) in combination with immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) immunotherapies on tumour growth and to investigate the underlying mechanisms. Design We used murine models of colorectal cancer and melanoma to evaluate whether oral administration of LGG improves the efficacy of ICB therapies. We performed the whole genome shotgun metagenome sequencing of intestinal contents and RNA sequencing of dendritic cells (DCs). In a series of in vitro and in vivo experiments, we further defined the immunological and molecular mechanisms of LGG-mediated antitumour immunity. Results We demonstrate that oral administration of live LGG augmented the antitumour activity of anti-programmed cell death 1 (PD-1) immunotherapy by increasing tumour-infiltrating DCs and T cells. Moreover, the combination treatment shifted the gut microbial community towards enrichment in Lactobacillus murinus and Bacteroides uniformis, that are known to increase DC activation and CD8 + tumour recruitment. Mechanistically, treatment with live LGG alone or in combination with anti-PD-1 antibody triggered type I interferon (IFN) production in DCs, enhancing the cross-priming of antitumour CD8 + T cells. In DCs, cyclic GMP-AMP synthase (cGAS)/stimulator of IFN genes (STING) was required for IFN-\u00ce\u00b2 induction in response to LGG, as evidenced by the significant decrease in IFN-\u00ce\u00b2 levels in cGAS or STING-deficient DCs. LGG induces IFN-\u00ce\u00b2 production via the cGAS/STING/TANK binding kinase 1/interferon regulatory factor 7 axis in DCs.

Furthermore, previous research compared LOS patients with non-age matched NLOS patients.

Methods/Design: This is a cross-sectional multicentre study that recruited in- and outpatients older adults (aged \u00e2\u2030\u00a555 years) with an ICD-10 diagnosis of schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder with NLOS and LOS. Sociodemographic and clinical characteristics, comorbidity, psychotropic medications, quality of life, functioning, and mental health care utilization were drawn for comparison. Results: Two hundred seventy-two participants (79.8%) had NLOS, 61 (17.9%) LOS, and 8 (2.3%) VLOSLP. LOS was significantly and independently associated with greater severity of emotional withdrawal and lower severity of depression (all p\u00c2\u00a0<\u00c2\u00a00.05).

Although the treatment of these disorders is mainly focused on resolving their mental component, one cannot neglect the need for the treatment of accompanying somatic symptoms. Melissa officinalis L. (lemon balm), in various formulations, has been extensively used as an ethnomedicinal remedy for the treatment of different psyche-related symptoms, and its use is considered relatively safe. Aim of the study: In the present study, the activity of M. officinalis (MO) essential oil was evaluated in several in vitro and in vivo models mimicking or involving anxiety-related somatic symptoms. Materials and methods: To address the effect of MO essential oil on the gastrointestinal and heart-related symptoms accompanying anxiety disorders, in vitro models were utilized that follow the function of the isolated mouse ileum and atria tissues, respectively, after exposure to MO essential oil. Effects of MO essential oil on BALB/c mice motor activity was estimated using the open field, rota-rod, and horizontal wire tests. Additionally, the essential oil was assayed for its potential in inhibiting acetylcholinesterase activity. Results: The performance of mice treated with 25 mg/kg of the oil showed a statistically significant decrease in the motor impairment arising from acute anxiety (open field test), while there was a prolonged latency and a reduction of the frequency of falling from a rotating rod and/or a horizontal wire (signs of muscle weakness/spasms). Concentrations of the essential oil higher than 1 \u00ce\u00bcg/mL were found to inhibit both spontaneous and induced ileum contractions. Moreover, the essential oil and citronellal were found to decrease isolated mouse atria contraction frequency, as well as contraction force. However, the oil was found to be a very weak acetylcholinesterase inhibitor. Conclusion: The modulation of anxiety-related symptoms by the oil was found not to be mediated through the inhibition of the acetylcholinesterase, nonetheless, the mechanistic studies involving the ileum and cardiac tissues, revealed that the activity of MO and citronellal might be related to the modification of either voltage-gated Ca2+ channels or muscarinic receptors. Mice locomotion, balance, and muscle strength were not impacted by the essential oil; however, its main constituent, citronellal, was found to exert a certain degree of muscle function inhibition. All these results suggest that the activity of MO essential oil arises from synergistic and/or antagonistic interactions of its constituents, and is not completely dependent on the oil's main constituent.",

For such adverse events, pharmacovigilance databases are of great interest. Case report: A 71-year-old patient with no rheumatologic history, in complete remission of a mantle-cell lymphoma following rituximab, doxorubicin, vincristine, cyclophosphamide, and prednisone induction, received a maintenance treatment with rituximab and lenalidomide.

We present a case in which interval treatment with 5% topical imiquimod was implemented for severe inflammatory response.

Background: At the height of the COVID-19 pandemic, a large nursing home chain implemented a policy to temporarily hold potentially unnecessary medications. We describe rates of held and discontinued medications after a temporary hold policy of potentially unnecessary or nonessential medications. Methods: This retrospective cohort study uses electronic health record (EHR) data on 3247 residents of 64 nursing homes operated by a multistate long-term care provider. Medications were documented in the electronic medication administration record. Overall medication held and discontinued incidences are reported. Hierarchical Bayesian modeling is used to determine individual probabilities for medication discontinuation within each facility. Results: In total, 3247 residents had 5297 nonessential medications held. Multivitamins were most likely to be held, followed by histamine-2 receptor antagonists, antihistamines, and statins. At the end of the hold policy, 2897 of 5297 (54%) were permanently discontinued, including probiotics (73%), histamine-2 receptor antagonists (66%), antihistamines (64%), and statins (45%). Demographics, cognitive and functional impairment were similar between residents with medications who were discontinued versus continued. For most medications, more than 50% of the variance in whether medications were discontinued was explained by facility rather than resident-level factors.

Identification of cervical metastatic lymph nodes (LN) on I-131 post-ablation whole-body planar scans (WBS) for cancer staging is crucial for patients with papillary thyroid cancer (PTC). The existing deep network is plagued by instability in finding the under-represented LN classes on highly complex WBS, where end-to-end tuned models that can account for this uncertainty region for multi-class locations are needed. Hence, as a key contribution of this study, we designed a novel leveraging segmentation network with input guidance (LSIG) end-to-end training model without pre and post-processing features that can learn ideal parameter settings depending on the quantity of multiple-object instances. To improve the co-occurrence of classes and control the false positive regions, we proposed a re-weighting negative control (RNC) mechanism that combines two key components, namely the re-weighting (Rw) term and the negative control function (NcF). This unified approximation of weighted training would leverage the network to control and learn the desired weights of true positives towards the LN region. As an end-to-end network training, we utilize a Unet-like convolution neural network (CNN) model. The performance of the LSIG is compared with the CNN-based networks, based on the ground truth (GT) mask developed using post-ablation single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT/CT). Furthermore, the effectiveness of the two components used in the LSIG framework is evaluated on WBS datasets.

The relationship between the levodopa challenge test (LDCT) and postoperative subthalamic nucleus-deep brain stimulation (STN-DBS) benefits is controversial in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD). We aim to evaluate the value of total levodopa response (TLR) and symptom levodopa response (SLR) in predicting postoperative improvement in different PD motor subtypes. Methods. Studies were split into a training set (147 patients) and a validation set (304 patients). We retrospectively collected data from 147 patients who received the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale- (UPDRS-) III and the Parkinson's Disease Questionnaire- (PDQ-) 39 evaluation. Patients were classified into tremor-dominant (TD), akinetic-rigid-dominant (AR), and mixed (MX) groups. Clinically important difference (CID) was employed to dichotomize DBS effects. For patients in each subtype group from the training set, we used the correlation and receiver operator characteristic (ROC) curve analyses to explore the strength of their relations. Areas under the curve (AUCs) were calculated and compared through the DeLong test. Results developed from the training set were applied into the validation set to predict postoperative improvement in different PD motor subtypes. Results. In the validation cohort, TLR significantly correlated with postoperative motor (p<0.001) and quality of life (QOL) (p<0.001) improvement in the MX group. The AUC between TLR and UPDRS-III (TU) is 0.800. The AUC between TLR and PDQ-39 (TP) is 0.770. An associated criterion in both TU and TP is around 50%. In the AR group, strong correlation was only found in SLR and PDQ-39 (SP) (p<0.001). And the AUC of SP is significantly larger than that in TLR and PDQ-39 (TP) (p=0.034). An associated criterion in SP is around 37%. No significant correlation was found in the TD group. Conclusions. We provide a more accurate judgment for LDCT. TLR strongly correlated with postoperative UPDRS-III and PDQ-39 improvement in MX patients. A TLR>50% may indicate a higher possibility of clinically meaningful benefits from STN-DBS comparing to medication only. SLR can well predict QOL improvement in AR patients.

Docetaxel therapy occasionally causes severe and life-threatening toxicities. Some docetaxel toxicities are related to exposure, and inter-individual variability in exposure has been described based on genetic variation and drug-drug interactions that impact docetaxel clearance. Cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4) and CYP3A5 metabolize docetaxel into inactive metabolites, and this is the primary mode of docetaxel clearance. Supporting their role in these toxicities, increased docetaxel toxicities have been found in patients with reduced- or loss-of-function variants in CYP3A4 and CYP3A5. However, since these variants in CYP3A4 are rare, little is known about the safety of docetaxel in patients who are homozygous for the reduced-function CYP3A4 variants. Here we present a case of life-threatening (grade 4) pneumonitis, dyspnea, and neutropenia resulting from a single dose of docetaxel. This patient was (1) homozygous for CYP3A4*22, which causes reduced expression and is associated with increased docetaxel-related adverse events, (2) heterozygous for CYP3A4*3, a rare reduced-function missense variant, and (3) homozygous for CYP3A5*3, a common loss of function splicing defect that has been associated with increased docetaxel exposure and adverse events. The patient also carried functional variants in other genes involved in docetaxel pharmacokinetics that may have increased his risk of toxicity. We identified one additional CYP3A4*22 homozygote that received docetaxel in our research cohort, and present this case of severe hematological toxicity. Furthermore, the one other CYP3A4*22 homozygous patient we identified from the literature died from docetaxel toxicity.

A common characteristic of familial (fALS) and sporadic amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (sALS) is the accumulation of aberrant proteinaceous species in the motor neurons and spinal cord of ALS patients - including aggregates of the human superoxide dismutase 1 (hSOD1). hSOD1 is an enzyme that occurs as a stable dimeric protein with several post-translational modifications such as the formation of an intramolecular disulfide bond and the acquisition of metal cofactors that are essential for enzyme activity and further contribute to protein stability. Some mutations and/or destabilizing factors promote hSOD1 misfolding, causing neuronal death. Aggregates containing misfolded wild-type hSOD1 have been found in the spinal cords of sALS as well as in non-hSOD1 fALS patients, leading to the hypothesis that hSOD1 misfolding is a common part of the ALS pathomechanism. Therefore, stabilizing the native conformation of SOD1 may be a promising approach to prevent the formation of toxic hSOD1 species and thus ALS pathogenesis. Here, we present the 16-mer peptide S1VL-21 that interferes with hSOD1 aggregation. S1VL-21 was identified by phage display selection with the native conformation of hSOD1 as a target. Several methods such as microscale thermophoresis (MST) measurements, aggregation assays, and cell viability assays revealed that S1VL-21 has a micromolar binding affinity to native hSOD1 and considerably reduces the formation of hSOD1 aggregates. This present work therefore provides the first important data on a potential lead compound for hSOD1-related drug development for ALS therapy.\n",

In low and middle-income countries, estimating the proportion of vaccinated toddlers in a population is important for controlling vaccine-preventable diseases by identifying districts where immunization services need strengthening. Estimates measured before and several years after specific interventions can assess program performance. However, employing different methods to derive vaccination coverage estimates often yield differing results. Methods: Linked vaccination coverage surveys and seroprotection surveys performed among ~300 toddlers 12\u00e2\u20ac\u201c23 months of age in districts (woredas), one per region, of Ethiopia (total, ~900 toddlers) in 2013 to estimate the proportion vaccinated with tetanus toxoid (a proxy for pentavalent vaccine) and measles vaccine. The surveys were followed by implementation of the Reaching Every District using Quality Improvement (RED-QI) approach to strengthen the immunization system. Linked coverage/serosurveys were repeated in 2016 to assess effects of the interventions on vaccination coverage. Indicators included \u00e2\u20ac\u0153documented coverage\u00e2\u20ac\u009d (vaccination card and/or health facility register records) and \u00e2\u20ac\u0153crude coverage\u00e2\u20ac\u009d (documented plus parent/caretaker recall for children without cards). Seroprotection thresholds were IgG-ELISA tetanus antitoxin \u00e2\u2030\u00a50.05 IU/ml and plaque reduction neutralization (PRN) measles titers \u00e2\u2030\u00a5120 mIU/ml. Findings: Improved markers in 2016 over 2013 include coverage of pentavalent vaccination, vaccination timeliness, and fewer missed opportunities to vaccinate. In parallel, tetanus seroprotection increased in the 3 woredas from 59.6% to 79.1%, 72.9% to 83.7%, and 94.3 to 99.3%. In 2015, the Ethiopian government conducted supplemental measles mass vaccination campaigns in several regions including one that involved a project woreda and the campaign overlapped with the RED-QI intervention timeframe; protective measles PRN titers there rose from 31.0% to 50.0%. Interpretation: The prevalence of seroprotective titers of tetanus antitoxin (stimulated by tetanus toxoid components within pentavalent vaccine) provides a reliable biomarker to identify children who received pentavalent vaccine. In the three study woredas, the RED-QI intervention appeared to improve immunization service delivery, as documented by enhanced pentavalent vaccine coverage, vaccination timeliness, and fewer missed vaccination opportunities. A measles mass vaccination campaign was followed by a markedly increased prevalence of measles PRN antibodies. Collectively, these observations suggest that wider implementation of RED-QI can strengthen immunization, and periodic linked vaccination surveys/serosurveys can monitor changes.",

Objective: To assess whether lithium augmentation of usual care reduces the rate of repeated episodes of suicide-related events (repeated suicide attempts, interrupted attempts, hospitalizations to prevent suicide, and deaths from suicide) in participants with bipolar disorder or depression who have survived a recent event. Design, Setting, and Participants: This double-blind, placebo-controlled randomized clinical trial assessed lithium vs placebo augmentation of usual care in veterans with bipolar disorder or depression who had survived a recent suicide-related event. Veterans at 29 VA medical centers who had an episode of suicidal behavior or an inpatient admission to prevent suicide within 6 months were screened between July 1, 2015, and March 31, 2019. Interventions: Participants were randomized to receive extended-release lithium carbonate beginning at 600 mg/d or placebo. Main Outcomes and Measures: Time to the first repeated suicide-related event, including suicide attempts, interrupted attempts, hospitalizations specifically to prevent suicide, and deaths from suicide. Results: The trial was stopped for futility after 519 veterans (mean [SD] age, 42.8 [12.4] years; 437 [84.2%] male) were randomized: 255 to lithium and 264 to placebo. Mean lithium concentrations at 3 months were 0.54 mEq/L for patients with bipolar disorder and 0.46 mEq/L for patients with major depressive disorder. No overall difference in repeated suicide-related events between treatments was found (hazard ratio, 1.10; 95% CI, 0.77-1.55). No unanticipated safety concerns were observed. A total of 127 participants (24.5%) had suicide-related outcomes: 65 in the lithium group and 62 in the placebo group. One death occurred in the lithium group and 3 in the placebo group. Conclusions and Relevance: In this randomized clinical trial, the addition of lithium to usual Veterans Affairs mental health care did not reduce the incidence of suicide-related events in veterans with major depression or bipolar disorders who experienced a recent suicide event.

We present a 49-year-old female treated with lithium carbonate due to a recurrent depressive disorder who developed NS during this therapy. NS spontaneously remitted after the drug withdrawal. Since her lithium serum levels were within the recommended values, we performed a retrospective analysis of lithium-induced NS cases trying to determine causes predisposing to the NS development, underlying histopathology, and preservation or irreversible loss of kidney function. This analysis revealed that in lithium-induced NS with AKI, lithium serum level was the key determinant of AKI development (the \u00ce\u00b2 coefficient = 0.8499 with a confidence interval ranging from 0.7452 to 0.9546 and p value < 0.0001).

Rationale: Guanosine has been shown to potentiate ketamine\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s antidepressant-like actions, although its ability to augment the anxiolytic effect of ketamine remains to be determined. Objective: This study investigated the anxiolytic-like effects of a single administration with low doses of ketamine and/or guanosine in mice subjected to chronic administration of corticosterone and the role of NLRP3-driven signaling. Methods: Corticosterone (20 mg/kg, p.o.) was administered for 21 days, followed by a single administration of ketamine (0.1 mg/kg, i.p.), guanosine (0.01 mg/kg, p.o.), or ketamine (0.1 mg/kg, i.p.) plus guanosine (0.01 mg/kg, p.o.). Anxiety-like behavior and NLRP3-related targets were analyzed 24 h following treatments. Results: Corticosterone reduced the time spent in the open arms and the central zone in the elevated plus-maze test and open-field test, respectively. Corticosterone raised the number of unsupported rearings and the number and time of grooming, and decreased the latency to start grooming in the open-field test. Disturbances in regional distribution (increased rostral grooming) and grooming transitions (increased aborted and total incorrect transitions) were detected in corticosterone-treated mice. These behavioral alterations were accompanied by increased immunocontent of Iba-1, ASC, NLRP3, caspase-1, TXNIP, and IL-1\u00ce\u00b2 in the hippocampus, but not in the prefrontal cortex. The treatments with ketamine, guanosine, and ketamine plus guanosine were effective to counteract corticosterone-induced anxiety-like phenotype, but not disturbances in the hippocampal NLRP3 pathway.

BACKGROUND: The intensity of the thromboprophylaxis needed as a potential factor for preventing inpatient mortality due to coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) remains unclear. OBJECTIVE: To explore the association between anticoagulation intensity and COVID-19 survival. DESIGN AND SETTING: Retrospective observational study in a tertiary-level hospital in Spain. METHODS: Low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) status was ascertained based on prescription at admission. To control for immortal time bias, anticoagulant use was analyzed as a time-dependent variable. RESULTS: 690 patients were included (median age, 72 years). LMWH was administered to 615 patients, starting from hospital admission (89.1%). 410 (66.7%) received prophylactic-dose LMWH; 120 (19.5%), therapeutic-dose LMWH; and another 85 (13.8%) who presented respiratory failure, high D-dimer levels (> 3 mg/l) and non-worsening of inflammation markers received prophylaxis of intermediate-dose LMWH. The overall inpatient-mortality rate was 38.5%. The anticoagulant nonuser group presented higher mortality risk than each of the following groups: Any LMWH users (HR 2.1; 95% CI: 1.40-3.15); the prophylactic-dose heparin group (HR 2.39; 95% CI, 1.57-3.64); and the users of heparin dose according to biomarkers (HR 6.52; 95% CI, 2.95-14.41). 3.4% of the patients experienced major hemorrhage. 2.8% of the patients developed an episode of thromboembolism. CONCLUSIONS: This observational study showed that LMWH administered at the time of admission was associated with lower mortality among unselected adult COVID-19 inpatients.

Background: 68 Ga-prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) PET/MRI has become an effective imaging method for prostate cancer. The purpose of this study was to use deep learning methods to perform low-dose image restoration on PSMA PET/MRI and to evaluate the effect of synthesis on the images and the medical diagnosis of patients at risk of prostate cancer. Methods: We reviewed the 68 Ga-PSMA PET/MRI data of 41 patients. The low-dose PET (LDPET) images of these patients were restored to full-dose PET (FDPET) images through a deep learning method based on MRI priors. The synthesized images were evaluated according to quantitative scores from nuclear medicine doctors and multiple imaging indicators, such as peak-signal noise ratio (PSNR), structural similarity (SSIM), normalization mean square error (NMSE), and relative contrast-to-noise ratio (RCNR). Results: The clinical quantitative scores of the FDPET images synthesized from 25%- and 50%-dose images based on MRI priors were 3.84\u00c2\u00b10.36 and 4.03\u00c2\u00b10.17, respectively, which were higher than the scores of the target images.

Purpose: To compare the efficacy of a lower dose background infusion of oxycodone for patient-controlled intravenous analgesia (PCIA) with the conventional dose, following intercostal nerve block, for the management of postoperative pain in patients undergoing thoracoscopic lobectomy for lung cancer. Patients and Methods: This was a prospective, single-center, randomized, parallelgroup, double-blind, controlled clinical trial. In total, 155 patients scheduled for elective radical lobectomy via video-assisted thoracoscopy were recruited from December 2018 to July 2019, of whom 140 were ultimately included in the study population. Patients were randomized to receive either oxycodone 0.25 mg/h (low-dose group, n=70) or oxycodone 0.5 mg/h (control group, n=70) as a background infusion for PCIA, following ropivacaine intercostal nerve block, for postoperative pain management. The primary endpoints were rest and dynamic visual analogue scale (VAS) scores within 72 h of the operation. The secondary endpoints were patient satisfaction scores, consumption of postoperative analgesics, times of patient-controlled analgesia (PCA), and adverse events. Results: All 140 enrolled patients completed the study requirements and were included in the final analysis. The rest and dynamic VAS scores at 4 h, 24 h, 48 h, and 72 h postoperative were comparable between the low-dose group and the control group (P>0.05). However, the low-dose group had statistically significantly higher patient satisfaction scores (P<0.001) and lower postoperative analgesic consumption (P<0.001) as well as lower incidence of nausea and vomiting (P<0.05). The times of PCA was not statistically significantly different between the two groups, and no serious adverse events occurred in either group (P>0.05).

Currently, there are no existing drugs that can cure PC and COVID-19. Luteolin can potentially be employed for COVID-19 treatment and serve as a potent anticancer agent. Our present study was conducted to discover the possible drug target and curative mechanism of luteolin to serve as treatment for PC and COVID-19. The differential gene expression of PC cases was determined via RNA sequencing. The application of network pharmacology and molecular docking aimed to exhibit the drug targets and pharmacological mechanisms of luteolin. In this study, we found the top 20 up- and downregulated gene expressions in PC patients. Enrichment data demonstrated anti-inflammatory effects, where improvement of metabolism and enhancement of immunity were the main functions and mechanism of luteolin in treating PC and COVID-19, characterized by associated signaling pathways.

Purpose: Schizophrenia is a chronic and serious mental disorder characterized by disturbances in thought, perception, and behavior that impair daily functioning and quality of life. Long-acting injectable (LAI) antipsychotic medications may improve long-term outcomes over oral medications; however, LAI antipsychotic medications are often only considered as a last resort late in the disease course. This study sought to assess current clinical practice patterns, clinicians\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 attitudes, and barriers to the use of LAI antipsychotic medications as well as identify unmet educational needs of psychiatric clinicians in managing patients with schizophrenia. Methods: A survey was distributed via email to 2330 United States-based clinicians who manage patients with schizophrenia; 379 completed the survey and were included for analysis. The survey included five patient case-based scenarios, with seven decision points. Data were analyzed with qualitative and quantitative methodologies. Results: Clinicians were most confident in determining when to initiate treatment and least confident in transitioning to injectable therapy or administering injectable therapy. Clinicians cited nonadherence, and not wanting to take daily medicine or the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153hassle\u00e2\u20ac\u009d of frequent treatment, as key factors for which patients were most suitable for an LAI antipsychotic medication.

Conclusion: This study suggests that clinicians may be reluctant to discuss or recommend switching patients to an LAI antipsychotic medication if they are perceived as doing well on current therapy. These results will inform future research and continuing education that aims to improve the confidence, knowledge, and competence of clinicians who provide care for patients with schizophrenia who may benefit from treatment with an LAI antipsychotic medication and clinicians who may be more likely to routinely offer an LAI antipsychotic medication to their patients.",

Oral dextrose gel massaged into the infant\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s inner cheek is a recent treatment option of asymptomatic hypoglycemia, after which oral feeding is encouraged. This approach seems to reduce the admission of infants to neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) so favouring maternal bonding and breastfeeding success at discharge.

The primary outcome was occurrence of NICU admission and the requirement of intravenous glucose administration; while discharge with full breastfeeding was the secondary outcome. Results: In Gr1, 39/389 (10%) infants presented with asymptomatic hypoglycemia, 19/39 were transferred to the NICU, and 14/39 required intravenous glucose treatment.

While the use of statins in treating patients with atherosclerosis is an undisputed success, the questions regarding an optimal starting time for treatment and its strength remain open. We proposed in our earlier paper published in Int. J. Mol. Sci. (2019, 20) that the growth of intima-media thickness of the carotid artery follows an S-shape (i.e., logistic) curve. In our subsequent paper in PLoS ONE (2020, 15), we incorporated this feature into a logistic control-theoretic model of atherosclerosis progression and showed that some combinations of patient age and intima-media thickness are better suited than others to start treatment. In this study, we perform a new and comprehensive calibration of our logistic model using a recent clinical database. This allows us to propose a procedure for inferring an optimal age to start statin treatment for a particular group of patients. We argue that a decrease in the slope of the IMT logistic growth curve, induced by statin treatment, is most efficient where the curve is at its steepest, whereby the efficiency means lowering the future IMT levels. Using the procedure on an aggregate group of severely sick men, 38 years of age is observed to correlate with the steepest point of the logistic curve, and, thus, it is the preferred time to start statin treatment.

Neuroblastoma is the most common extracranial solid tumour in children, accounting for 15% of all paediatric cancer deaths. High-risk neuroblastoma is a particularly challenging-to-treat form of disease that requires multimodality treatment, consisting of chemotherapy, surgery, high-dose chemotherapy with autologous haematopoietic stem cell rescue, radiotherapy and differentiation therapy. However, despite intense multimodal treatment regimens, the prognosis for this patient population remains poor. In recent years, immunotherapy with anti-disialoganglioside 2 (anti-GD2) antibodies was found to improve survival rates for patients with high-risk neuroblastoma. Based on studies led by the SIOPEN (International Society of Paediatric Oncology European Neuroblastoma) group, the anti-GD2 antibody dinutuximab beta was approved for use in high-risk neuroblastoma by the European Medicines Agency and has been implemented into the standard of care in many countries across Europe.

Background: In patients with COVID-19, granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF) might be a mediator of the hyperactive inflammatory response associated with respiratory failure and death. We aimed to evaluate whether mavrilimumab, a monoclonal antibody to the GM-CSF receptor, would improve outcomes in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia and systemic hyperinflammation. Methods: This investigator-initiated, multicentre, double-blind, randomised trial was done at seven hospitals in the USA. Inclusion required hospitalisation, COVID-19 pneumonia, hypoxaemia, and a C-reactive protein concentration of more than 5 mg/dL. Patients were excluded if they required mechanical ventilation. Patients were randomly assigned (1:1) centrally, with stratification by hospital site, to receive mavrilimumab 6 mg/kg as a single intravenous infusion, or placebo. Participants and all clinical and research personnel were masked to treatment assignment. The primary endpoint was the proportion of patients alive and off supplemental oxygen therapy at day 14. The primary outcome and safety were analysed in the intention-to-treat population. This trial is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04399980, NCT04463004, and NCT04492514. Findings: Between May 28 and Sept 15, 2020, 40 patients were enrolled and randomly assigned to mavrilimumab (n=21) or placebo (n=19). A trial of 60 patients was planned, but given slow enrolment, the study was stopped early to inform the natural history and potential treatment effect.

In this study, a medicated osteoinductive and bioresorbable bone graft was designed and investigated for its ability to control antibiotic drug release in situ. This represents an ideal solution for the eradication or prevention of infection, while simultaneously repairing bone defects. Vancomycin hydrochloride and gentamicin sulfate, here considered for testing, were loaded into a previously developed and largely investigated hybrid bone-mimetic scaffold made of collagen fibers biomineralized with magnesium doped-hydroxyapatite (MgHA/Coll), which in the last ten years has widely demonstrated its effective potential in bone tissue regeneration. Here, we have explored whether it can be used as a controlled local delivery system for antibiotic drugs. An easy loading method was selected in order to be reproducible, quickly, in the operating room.

Radical cure colitis is a severe public health threat worldwide. Our previous studies have confirmed that melatonin can effectively improve gut microbiota disorder and mucosal injury caused by sleep deprivation (SD). The present study further explored the mechanism whereby ex-ogenous melatonin prevented SD-induced colitis. 16S rRNA high-throughput sequencing and metabolomics analysis were used to explore the correlation between SD-induced colitis and intestinal microbiota and metabolite composition in mice. Fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) and melatonin or butyrate supplementation tests verified the core role of gut microbiota in melatonin-alleviating SD-induced colitis. Further, in vitro tests studied the modulatory mechanism of metabolite butyrate. The results demonstrated that SD leads to reductions in plasma melatonin levels and colonic Card9 expression and consequent occurrence of colitis and gut microbiota disorder, especially the downregulation of Faecalibacterium and butyrate levels. The FMT from SD-mice to normal mice could restore SD-like colitis, while butyrate supplementation to SD-mice inhibited the occurrence of colitis, but with no change in the plasma melatonin level in both treatments. However, melatonin supplementation reversed all inductions in SD-mice. In intestinal epithelial cells, the inflammatory ameliorative effect of butyrate was blocked with pretreatments of HDAC3 agonist and HIF-1\u00ce\u00b1 antagonist but was mimicked by GSK-3\u00ce\u00b2 and p-P65 antagonists. Therefore, the administra-tion of MLT may be a better therapy for SD-induced colitis relative to butyrate.

Purpose: Critically ill patients with preserved or increased renal function have been shown to be at risk of underexposure to meropenem. Although many meropenem population pharmacokinetic (PK) models have been published, there is no large prospective population PK study with rich sampling focusing on patients most at risk of suboptimal pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) target attainment. Therefore, the aim of the present study was to evaluate PK/PD target attainment and to perform a thorough covariate screening using population PK modelling of meropenem in septic patients with preserved or increased renal function. Patients and Methods: A single-centre prospective observational PK study was performed in the intensive care unit (ICU) of the University Hospitals Leuven. Patients with severe sepsis or septic shock and treated with meropenem in the ICU were screened for inclusion. Patients were excluded if they received renal replacement therapy or had an estimated glomerular filtration rate according to the Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology collaboration equation <70 mL/min/1.73m2 on the day of PK sampling. Successful PK/PD target attainment was defined as an unbound meropenem trough concentration above 2 mg/L or 8 mg/L. Population PK modelling was performed with NONMEM7.4. Results: In total, 58 patients were included, contributing 345 plasma samples over 70 dosing intervals.

This is especially pertinent to transmissible cancers, which evade immune detection across genetically diverse hosts. The Tasmanian devil (Sarcophilus harrisii) is threatened by the emergence of Devil Facial Tumour Disease (DFTD), comprising two transmissible cancers (DFT1 and DFT2). The development of effective prophylactic vaccines and therapies against DFTD has been restricted by an incomplete understanding of how allogeneic DFT1 and DFT2 cells maintain immune evasion upon activation of tumour-specific immune responses. In this study, we used RNA sequencing to examine tumours from three experimental DFT1 cases. Two devils received a vaccine prior to inoculation with live DFT1 cells, providing an opportunity to explore changes to DFT1 cancers under immune pressure. Analysis of DFT1 in the non-immunised devil revealed a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcmyelinating Schwann cell\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 phenotype, reflecting both natural DFT1 cancers and the DFT1 cell line used for the experimental challenge.

In response to immune pressure, mesenchymal plasticity and upregulation of immune checkpoint molecules are used by human cancers to evade immune responses. Similar mechanisms are associated with immune evasion by DFTD cancers, providing novel insights that will inform modification of DFTD vaccines. As DFT1 and DFT2 are clonal cancers transmitted across genetically distinct hosts, the Tasmanian devil provides a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcnatural\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 disease model for more broadly exploring these immune evasion mechanisms in cancer.",

The underlying mechanisms of differing aging rates across body masses are unclear, but it is generally agreed that metabolism is a significant regulator of the aging process. Herein, we performed a targeted metabolomics analysis on primary fibroblasts isolated from small and large breed young and old dogs. Regardless of size, older dogs exhibited lower glutathione and ATP, consistent with a role for oxidative stress and bioenergetic decline in aging. Furthermore, several size-specific metabolic patterns were observed with aging, including the following: (i) An apparent defect in the lower half of glycolysis in large old dogs at the level of pyruvate kinase. (ii) Increased glutamine anaplerosis into the TCA cycle in large old dogs. (iii) A potential defect in coenzyme A biosynthesis in large old dogs.

These associations were stronger in models using metrics adjusted for the pre-vaccination baseline period.

The purpose of this study was to explore the specific mechanism in which miR-29\u00c2\u00a0c-3p participated in insulin function to regulate PCOS by targeting Forkhead box O 3 (Foxo3). Peripheral blood from PCOS patients and healthy volunteers were first collected, and the expression levels of miR-29\u00c2\u00a0c-3p and Foxo3 were detected by reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction or Western blot. Then human granular tumor cell line (KGN) was treated with insulin, and transfected with plasmid vectors interfering with miR-29\u00c2\u00a0c-3p or Foxo3 expression. Cell proliferation was detected by Cell counting kit-8 and plate cloning, and cell apoptosis was tested by flow cytometry. In addition, PCOS rat model was established. PCOS rats were injected with plasmids vectors interfering with miR-29\u00c2\u00a0c-3p or Foxo3 expression, respectively.

Triple-negative metaplastic breast carcinoma (MBC) poses a significant treatment challenge due to lack of targeted therapies and chemotherapy resistance. We isolated a novel MBC cell line, BAS, which showed a molecular and phenotypic profile different from the only other metaplastic cell model, HS578T cells. To gain insight behind chemotherapeutic resistance, we generated doxorubicin (HS-DOX, BAS-DOX) and paclitaxel (HS-TX, BAS-TX) resistant derivatives of both cell lines. Drug sensitivity assays indicated a truly multidrug resistant (MDR) phenotype. Both BAS-DOX and BAS-TX showed up-regulation of FOXC1 and its experimental down-regulation re-sensitized cells to doxorubicin and paclitaxel. Experimental modulation of FOXC1 expression in MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells corroborated its role in MDR. Genome-wide expression analyses identified gene expression signatures characterized by up-regulation of TGFB2, which encodes cytokine TGF-\u00ce\u00b22, in both BAS-DOX and BAS-TX cells. Pharmacological inhibition of the TGF-\u00ce\u00b2 pathway with galunisertib led to down-regulation of FOXC1 and increase in drug sensitivity in both BAS-DOX and BAS-TX cells. MicroRNA (miR) expression analyses identified high endogenous miR-495-3p levels in BAS cells that were downregulated in both BAS MDR cells. Transient expression of miR-495-3p mimic in BAS-DOX and BAS-TX cells caused downregulation of TGFB2 and FOXC1 and re-sensitized cells to doxorubicin and paclitaxel, whereas miR-495-3p inhibition in BAS cells led to increase in resistance to both drugs and up-regulation of TGFB2 and FOXC1.

Methods: We enrolled cancer patients who were treated with an irinotecan-containing regimen and did not have severe renal failure. The total and unbound concentrations of SN-38 in the plasma were measured by high-performance liquid chromatography. AUC values were calculated and normalized to the actual irinotecan dose (AUC/dose). The OATP1B1 521T>C was analyzed by direct sequencing.

Background: Trichomonas vaginalis (TV), Mycoplasma genitalium (MG) and Ureaplasma urealyticum (UU) are common sexually transmitted infections (STIs) that are diagnosed in infertile couples (cps). In cases with their simultaneous presence in a patient (mixed STI, MSTIs), treatment is complicated by the different sensitivity of microorganisms to antibacterial drugs. Moreover, in cases of complicated infections, the empirical treatment should be started before obtaining the results of drug susceptibilities. Objective: The objective of the current study is to find the effective and well-tolerated combination of drugs for the empirical antibacterial treatment of mixed STIs presented by TV, MG and UU in infertile couples. We also aimed to establish the influence of mixed STIs on semen quality. Methods: Our prospective study included 154 infertile couples (308 patients) with confirmed symptomatic MSTIs in one of the couples caused by the simultaneous presence of TV, MG and UU. All couples were randomized on three groups for empirical treatment: Group 1 (n=49 cps, 98 pts) who were treated by initial prescribing of anti-trichomoniasis drug Secnidazole, 2.0 g po followed by Azythromycin 500 mg on day 1 continuing by 250 mg on days 2-7; Group 2 (n=52 cps, 104 pts: Secnidazole, 2.0 g po followed by Josamycin 1000 mg bid for 12 days); Group 3 (n=53 cps, 106 pts: Secnidazole, 2.0 g po followed by Moxifloxacin 400 mg once daily for 12 days). The endpoints were clinical and microbiological cure rates as well as the frequency of side-effects in analyzed groups. We determined the basic parameters of the spermogram and Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) fragmentation levels in 59 patients with MSTIs before and at the 3rd, 6th and 9th month after pathogens eradication comparing them with results in 63 healthy sperm donors. Results: After the treatment, clinical cure rates in analyzed groups were 82.6% (Group 1) vs. 96.1% (Group 2) vs. 92.3% (Group 3). Microbiological cure rates (UU+MG) were 73.9% vs. 97.1% vs. 84.5% correspondingly (p<0.05). TV microbiological cure rates were 97.8% vs. 98.0% vs. 96.1% (p>0.05).

Introduction: Haematological patients are at higher risk of bloodstream infections (BSI) after chemotherapy. The aim of this study was to develop a simulation model assessing the impact of selective digestive decontamination (SDD) of haematological patients colonised with extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing Enterobacterales (ESBL-E) on the incidence of ESBL-E BSI after chemotherapy. Methods: A patient population was created by a stochastic simulation model mimicking the patients\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 states of colonisation with ESBL-E during hospitalisation. A systematic literature search was performed to inform the model. All ESBL-E carriers were randomised (1:1) to either the intervention (targeted SDD) or the control group (placebo). ESBL-E BSI incidence was the outcome of the model. Sensitivity analyses were performed by prevalence of ESBL-E carriage at hospital admission (low: < 10%, medium: 10\u00e2\u20ac\u201c25%, high: > 25%), duration of neutropenia after receiving chemotherapy, administration of antibiotic prophylaxis with quinolones, and time interval between SDD and chemotherapy. Results: The model estimated that the administration of targeted SDD before chemotherapy reduces the incidence of ESBL-E BSI in the hospitalised haematological population up to 27%. The greatest benefit was estimated in high-prevalence settings, regardless of the duration of neutropenia, the time interval before chemotherapy, and the administration of antibiotic prophylaxis with quinolones (p < 0.05). In medium-prevalence settings, SDD was effective in patients receiving quinolone prophylaxis, with either 1-day time interval before chemotherapy and a neutropenia duration > 6\u00c2\u00a0days (p < 0.05) or 7-day time interval before chemotherapy and a neutropenia duration > 9\u00c2\u00a0days (p < 0.05). No benefit was observed in low-prevalence settings. Conclusions: Our model suggests that targeted SDD could decrease the rate of ESBL-E BSI in haematological carriers before chemotherapy in the setting of high ESBL-E prevalence at hospital admission.

Introduction: Rapid outbreak response vaccination is a strategy for measles control and elimination. Measles vaccines must be stored and transported within a specified temperature range, but this can present significant challenges when targeting remote populations. Measles vaccine licensure for delivery outside cold chain (OCC) could provide more vaccine transport/storage space without ice packs, and a solution to shorten response times. However, due to vaccine safety and wastage considerations, the OCC strategy will require other operational changes, potentially including the use of 1-dose (monodose) instead of 10-dose vials, requiring larger transport/storage equipment currently achieved with 10-dose vials. These trade-offs require quantitative comparisons of vaccine delivery options to evaluate their relative benefits. Methods: We developed a modelling framework combining elements of the vaccine supply chain - cold chain, vial, team, and transport equipment types - with a measles transmission dynamics model to compare vaccine delivery options. We compared 10 strategies resulting from combinations of the vaccine supply elements and grouped into three main classes: OCC, partial cold chain (PCC), and full cold chain (FCC). For each strategy, we explored a campaign with 20 teams sequentially targeting 5 locations with 100,000 individuals each. We characterised the time needed to freeze ice packs and complete the campaign (campaign duration), vaccination coverage, and cases averted, assuming a fixed pre-deployment delay before campaign commencement. We performed sensitivity analyses of the pre-deployment delay, population sizes, and two team allocation schemes. Results: The OCC, PCC, and FCC strategies achieve campaign durations of 50, 51, and 52 days, respectively. Nine of the ten strategies can achieve a vaccination coverage of 80%, and OCC averts the most cases.

The EASIX (Endothelial Activation and Stress Index) score (lactate dehydrogenase [LDH; U/L] 3 creatinine [mg/dL]/platelets [PLTs; 109 cells/L]) is a marker of endothelial damage that correlates with outcomes in allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation. Elevated LDH and low PLTs have been associated with severe CRS and ICANS, as has C-reactive protein (CRP), while increased creatinine is seen only in a minority of advanced severe CRS cases. We hypothesized that EASIX and 2 new modified EASIX formulas (simplified EASIX, which excludes creatinine, and modified EASIX [m-EASIX], which replaces creatinine with CRP [mg/dL]), calculated peri-CAR T-cell infusion, would be associated with development of severe (grade $ 3) CRS and ICANS.

The 3 formulas showed similar predictive power for severe CRS and ICANS. However, low PLTs and high CRP values were the only variables individually correlated with these toxicities. Moreover, only m-EASIX was a significant predictor of disease response. m-EASIX could discriminate patients who subsequently developed severe CRS preceding the onset of severe symptoms (area under the curve [AUC] at lymphodepletion, 80.4%; at day 21, 73.0%; and at day 11, 75.4%).

To directly test reprotoxicity, the spermatogenic cells (GC-1 spg and GC-2 spd cells) were incubated for 48 and 96 h with amitriptyline (hydrochloride) (AMI), escitalopram (ESC), fluoxetine (hydrochloride) (FLU), imipramine (hydrochloride) (IMI), mirtazapine (MIR), olanzapine (OLZ), reboxetine (mesylate) (REB), and venlafaxine (hydrochloride) (VEN), and several cellular and biochemical features were assessed. Obtained results reveal that all investigated substances showed considerable reprotoxic potency leading to micronuclei formation, which, in turn, resulted in upregulation of telomeric binding factor (TRF1/TRF2) protein expression. The TRF-based response was strictly dependent on p53/p21 signaling and was followed by irreversible G2/M cell cycle arrest and finally initiation of apoptotic cell death. In conclusion, our findings suggest that antidepressants promote a telomere-focused DNA damage response in germ cell lines, which broadens the established view of antidepressants\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 and neuroleptic drugs\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 toxicity and points to the need for further research in this topic with the use of in vivo models and human samples.",

Background: Drug repurposing is the fastest effective method to provide treatment for coronavirus disease (COVID-19). Drugs that targeting a closely related virus with similar genetic material such as hepatitis C virus (HCV) and more specifically targeting a similar viral protease would be an excellent choice. Methods: In this study, we carried out a virtual screening for fifteen anti HCV drugs against COVID-19 main protease using computational molecular docking techniques. Moreover, Velpatasvir (4) and Sofosbuvir (13) drugs were further evaluated through molecular dynamics simulations followed by calculating the binding free energy using the molecular mechanics generalised born/solvent accessibility (MM-GBSA) approach. Results: The binding affinity descending order was N3 natural inhibitor (1), Velpatasvir (4), Sofosbuvir (13), Ombitasvir (3), Glecaprevir (2), Asunaprevir (8), Paritaprevir (10), Grazoprevir (11), Elbasvir (6), Ledipasvir (5), Daclatasvir (7), Pibrentasvir (9), Simeprevir (12), Dasabuvir (14), Taribavirin (16) and finally Ribavirin (15). Molecular dynamics simulation reveals that Sofosbuvir (13) has exciting properties and it was stable within the active site and also showed good MM-GBSA compared to the natural inhibitor N3. Conclusion: Our results could be auspicious for fast repurposing of the examined drugs either alone or in combinations with each other for the treatment of the COVID-19. Furthermore, this work provides a clear spot on the structure-activity relationship (SAR) for targeting the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) main protease and helps the design and synthesis of new drugs in the future targeting it as well.\n",

Background: Patients with advanced high-grade serous ovarian cancer (HGSOC) are usually treated with paclitaxel and carboplatin; however, predictive markers for this drug combination are unknown. Methods: Tumor samples from 71 consecutive HGSOC patients, who received neoadjuvant chemotherapy with paclitaxel and carboplatin, were subjected to molecular analysis. Results: BRCA1/2 germline mutation carriers (n = 22) had longer treatment-free interval (TFI) than non-carriers (n = 49) (9.5\u00c2\u00a0months vs. 3.8\u00c2\u00a0months; P = 0.007). Fifty-one HGSOCs had sufficient quality of tumor DNA for the next-generation sequencing (NGS) analysis by the SeqCap EZ CNV/LOH Backbone Design panel. All 13 tumors obtained from BRCA1/2 germline mutation carriers and 12 sporadic HGSOCs showed a high number of evenly spread chromosomal breaks, which was defined as a BRCAness phenotype; median TFI for this combined group approached 9.5\u00c2\u00a0months. The remaining 26 HGSOCs had similarly high global LOH score (above 20%); however, in contrast to BRCAness tumors, LOH involved large chromosomal segments; these patients had significantly lower TFI (3.7\u00c2\u00a0months; P = 0.006). All patients with CCNE1 amplification (n = 7), TP53 R175H substitution (n = 6), and RB1 mutation (n = 4) had poor response to paclitaxel plus carboplatin. Conclusion: This study describes a cost-efficient method of detecting the BRCAness phenotype, which is compatible with the laboratory-scale NGS equipment.

We investigated the relationship between PCD/T and tumour control or AE. Methods: We analysed PCD/T in patients treated with D + T for metastatic melanoma. We collected data of tumour response (RECIST 1.1) and AE (CTCAE 4.0) blinded to PCD/T results. Results: We analysed 71 D and 58T assays from 34 patients. High inter-individual variability of PCD (median: 65.0 ng/mL; interquartile range (IQR) [4\u00e2\u20ac\u201c945]) and of PCT (median: 8.6 ng/mL; IQR [5\u00e2\u20ac\u201c39]) was observed. We found a weak relationship between PCD and progression-free survival, taking follow-up time into account (hazard ratio 0.991; 95%CI, 0.981 to 1.000; P = 0.06).

Introduction: Catheter ablation for atrial fibrillation (AF) in comparison to medical therapy alone is known to improve freedom from arrhythmia and quality of life, but the benefit regarding mortality is unclear. The publication of several recent large randomized controlled trials (RCT) comparing ablation with medical therapy has warranted an updated meta-analysis. Methods: We sought to compare the effectiveness of catheter ablation versus medical therapy only in patients with AF. MEDLINE, Cochrane, and ClinicalTrials.gov databases were searched from inception until 04/30/2021. Relevant RCTs comparing catheter ablation versus medical therapy in patients with AF were selected. Results: A total of 24 RCTs involving 5730 adult patients were included (2992 in catheter ablation and 2738 in medical therapy). There was a reduction in all-cause mortality with catheter ablation compared with medical therapy only (risk ratio (RR) 0.70 [95% confidence interval (CI) 0.55\u00e2\u20ac\u201c0.89]; p =.003).

Objective Effective antimicrobial containment strategies such as Antimicrobial Stewardship Programs (ASPs) require comprehensive data on antibiotics use which are scarce in Ethiopia. This study sought to assess antibiotics use and healthcare-associated infections (HCAIs) in Ethiopian public hospitals. Design We conducted a cross-sectional study using the WHO point-prevalence survey protocol for systemic antibiotics use and HCAIs for low/middle-income countries. Setting The study was conducted among 10 public hospitals in 2021. Participants All patients admitted to adult and paediatric inpatient and emergency wards before or at 08:00 on the survey date were enrolled. Outcome measure The primary outcome measures were the prevalence of antibiotic use, HCAIs and the hospitals' readiness to implement ASP. Results Data were collected from 1820 patient records. None of the surveyed hospitals had functional ASP. The common indication for antibiotics was for HCAIs (40.3%). Pneumonia was the most common bacterial infection (28.6%) followed by clinical sepsis (17.8%). Most treatments were empiric (96.7%) and the overall prevalence of antibiotic use was 63.8% with antibiotics prescription per patient ratio of 1.77. Ceftriaxone was the most commonly prescribed antibiotic (30.4%) followed by metronidazole (15.4%). Age, having HIV infection, ward type, type of hospital, catheterisation and intubation history had significant association with antibiotic use. Patients who were treated in paediatric surgical wards were about four times more likely to be on antibiotics compared with patients treated at an adult emergency ward. Patients on urinary catheter (adjusted OR (AOR)=2.74, 95% CI: 2.04 to 3.68) and intubation device (AOR=2.62, 95% CI: 1.02 to 6.76) were more likely to be on antibiotics than their non-intubated/non-catheterised counterparts. Patients treated at secondary-level hospitals had 0.34 times lower odds of being on antibiotics compared with those in tertiary hospitals.

Overcoming or suppressing RPIAM can dramatically improve the treatment out-come. Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is frequently diagnosed in an advanced stage and often possesses intrinsic resistance to chemotherapy accompanied by the fast development of acquired resistance during the treatment.

The effect of testosterone replacement therapy on muscle function in men with chronic pain and low total testosterone remains to be investigated. Objectives: To investigate the effects of testosterone replacement therapy on muscle function and gait performance in men treated with opioids for chronic non-cancer pain. Materials and methods: A double-blind, placebo-controlled study.

Methods: This was a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, 2-period study evaluating the safety and pharmacokinetics of ND0612 in PD patients on an optimized oral levodopa regimen and experiencing \u00e2\u2030\u00a52 h/day of OFF time. During Period-1, patients received their current standard of care (SoC) levodopa/carbidopa and were randomized (2:1) to 14 days treatment with adjunct ND0612 (daily levodopa/carbidopa dose of 270/63 mg) or placebo infusion +SoC. During Period-2, 16 patients were randomized to receive 7 days treatment with ND0612 or ND0612 plus oral entacapone. Reduction in OFF time was analyzed as an exploratory measure using a futility design with a predefined margin of 1.6 h. Results: ND0612 was well-tolerated; most patients experienced infusion site nodules (95% vs. 56% with placebo), which all resolved without sequelae.

However, obstacles in designing bone-mimetic materials that could integrate the biomimetic nature of the bone extracellular matrix, osteogenic cells, and osteoinductive ingredients with a fast and convenient strategy still exist. Methods: This study designed and fabricated a mesenchymal stem cell (MSC)-laden, nanohydroxyapatite (HAP), and nanosilicate (SN)-loaded bone mimetic and injectable gelatin-methacryloyl hydrogel (GelMA-HAP-SN) system for bone tissue engineering, and systemically investigated the osteogenic capacity of GelMA-HAP-SN in vitro and in vivo. Results: Introducing HAP enhanced the compositional similarity to the natural bone extracellular matrix, and SN loading endowed the hydrogel with injectable and osteogenic ability.

Purpose: Antibiotic-resistant bacteria are pathogens that have emerged as a serious public health risk. Thus, there is an urgent need to develop a new generation of anti-bacterial materials to kill antibiotic-resistant bacteria. Methods: Nanosilver-decorated mesoporous organosilica nanoparticles (Ag-MONs) were fabricated for co-delivery of gentamicin (GEN) and nanosilver. After investigating the glutathione (GSH)-responsive matrix degradation and controlled release of both GEN and silver ions, the anti-bacterial activities of Ag-MONs@GEN were systematically determined against several antibiotic-susceptible and antibiotic-resistant bacteria including Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, and Enterococcus faecalis. Furthermore, the cytotoxic profiles of Ag-MONs@GEN were evaluated. Results: The GEN-loaded nanoplatform (Ag-MONs@GEN) showed glutathione-responsive matrix degradation, resulting in the simultaneous controlled release of GEN and silver ions.

Introduction: Neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder (NMOSD) is an autoimmune disease defined by attacks on the central nervous system that cause irreversible damage. Recent approval of NMOSD therapies warrants investigations of comparative efficacy to inform treatment decisions. Methods: A network meta-analysis (NMA) of all U.S. Food and Drug Administration-approved therapies (eculizumab, inebilizumab, and satralizumab) for adults with aquaporin-4 immunoglobulin G-positive (AQP4+) NMOSD was conducted via a systematic literature review (SLR) using data from randomized controlled trials (RCTs). Database searches of MEDLINE, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials were executed for the SLR. A fixed-effects proportional hazards Bayesian NMA was used to estimate relative treatment effects based on data extracted from RCTs identified during the SLR (search end date: 11 September 2020). Four unique RCTs (N-MOmentum, PREVENT, SAkuraSky, and SAkuraStar) were identified, and data from 29 publications were extracted for analysis. Network scenarios describing the most comparable patient population groups (such as by treatment settings) were evaluated in our analyses. Relative treatment effects were evaluated based on time-to-first relapse and were expressed as hazard ratios (HRs) with 95% credible intervals (CrIs). Results: In patients treated with a monoclonal antibody only, eculizumab was associated with a lower risk of relapse compared with satralizumab (HR 0.10, 95% CrI 0.01, 0.65) and inebilizumab (HR 0.11, 95% CrI 0.02, 0.68).

Acarbose and metformin can also be considered if intensive lifestyle modification has been ineffective for 6 months. But the effects of intensive lifestyle modification and glucose-lowering drug interventions that work best in the population with IGT are unclear. This network meta-analysis assessed the effectiveness of intensive lifestyle modification, acarbose, and metformin in treating populations with IGT. Methods: We systematically searched both Chinese- and English-language databases, including China Knowledge, the Cochrane Library, Embase, PubMed, VIP, and Wanfang, for articles published between database inception and September 2019. Randomized, controlled clinical trials in patients with IGT treated with acarbose, metformin, and intensive lifestyle modification were assessed for eligibility. The data from all included studies were evaluated by 2 reviewers independently in accordance with the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Intervention version 6.0. A network meta-analysis was performed by using R software version 3.6.1. Findings: The data from 53 randomized controlled trials were included in the review, with a sample size of 21,208 patients.

Patient demographics, operating room data, and subsequent hospital course was extracted from their electronic medical record and plotted using R Studio statistical software. Results: The overwhelming majority of patients received single-shot spinals with both local anesthetic and either morphine or hydromorphone. Average pain scores were 1 out of 10 with standard deviation of 1.6 in the immediate postoperative period and decreased over the next 72\u00c2\u00a0h. Oral morphine equivalents consumed did not exceed 0.61\u00c2\u00a0ME/kg/day. The most common adverse reaction was pruritus. Conclusions: Spinal anesthesia was most commonly used for split-thickness skin grafting in the pediatric burn population and provides excellent analgesia for patients\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 immediate postoperative course, including their initial dressing changes, with minimal risk for complications. Pain was well-controlled in all subgroups indicating that this strategy can be used flexibly in a variety of pediatric burn patients.",

There is mounting evidence of circadian rhythm disruption in Alzheimer's disease (AD); however, the cause-And-effect relationship between them is not understood. Chronic constant light exposure effectively disrupts circadian rhythm in rats. On the basis of previous publications, we hypothesized that chronic constant light exposure might contribute significantly to development of AD-like-phenotype in rats and that fluoxetine (Flx) treatment might protect the brain against it. Adult male rats were exposed to normal light-dark cycles, constant light (LL), constant dark, and LL+Flx (5 mg/kg/day, ZT5) for four months. The expression of molecular markers of circadian rhythm: Per2 transcripts; and protein expression of peroxiredoxin-1 (PRX1) and hyperoxidized peroxiredoxins (PRX-SO2/3) were significantly dysregulated in the suprachiasmatic nuclei (SCN) of LL rats, which was prevented with concomitant fluoxetine administration. The levels of glutamate and \u00ce\u00b3-Aminobutyric acid were dysregulated, and oxidative damage was observed in the SCN and hippocampi of LL rats. Fluoxetine treatment conferred protection against oxidative damage in LL rats. Constant light exposure also impaired rats' performance on Y-maze, Morris maze, and novel object recognition test, which was prevented with fluoxetine administration. A significant elevation in soluble A\u00ce\u00b21-42 levels, which strongly correlated with upregulation of Bace1 and Mgat3 transcripts was observed in the hippocampus of LL rats. Further, the expression of antiaging gene Sirt1 was downregulated, and neuronal damage indicator Prokr2 was upregulated in hippocampus. Fluoxetine rescued A\u00ce\u00b21-42 upregulation and AD-related genes' dysregulation. Our findings show that circadian disruption by exposure to chronic constant light may contribute to progression of AD, which can be prevented with fluoxetine treatment.",

Beh\u00c3\u00a7et\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s syndrome (BS) is a systemic vasculitis with several clinical manifestations. Neutrophil hyperactivation mediates vascular BS pathogenesis, via both a massive reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) release. Here, we investigated neutrophil-mediated mechanisms of damage in non-vascular BS manifestations and explored the in-vitro effects of colchicine in counteracting these mechanisms. NETs and intracellular ROS production was assessed in blood samples from 80 BS patients (46 with active non-vascular BS, 34 with inactive disease) and 80 healthy controls. Moreover, isolated neutrophils were incubated for 1\u00c2\u00a0h with an oxidating agent [2,2\u00e2\u20ac\u00b2-azobis (2-amidinopropane) dihydrochloride; 250\u00c2\u00a0nM] and the ability of pure colchicine pretreatment (100\u00c2\u00a0ng/ml) to counteract oxidation-induced damage was assessed. Patients with active non-vascular BS showed remarkably increased NET levels [21.2, interquartile range (IQR)\u00c2\u00a0=\u00c2\u00a018.3\u00e2\u20ac\u201c25.9 mU/ml] compared to patients with inactive disease (16.8, IQR\u00c2\u00a0=\u00c2\u00a013.3\u00e2\u20ac\u201c20.2 mU/ml) and to controls (7.1, IQR\u00c2\u00a0=\u00c2\u00a05.1\u00e2\u20ac\u201c8.7 mU/ml, p\u00c2\u00a0<\u00c2\u00a00.001].

In active non-vascular BS, NETs correlated with neutrophil ROS production (p\u00c2\u00a0<\u00c2\u00a00.001) and were particularly increased in patients with active mucosal (p\u00c2\u00a0<\u00c2\u00a00.001), articular (p\u00c2\u00a0=\u00c2\u00a00.004) and gastrointestinal symptoms (p\u00c2\u00a0=\u00c2\u00a00.006). In isolated neutrophils, colchicine significantly reduced oxidation-induced NET production and cell apoptosis, although not via an anti-oxidant activity.

Importance: Open-angle glaucoma may continue to progress despite significant lowering of intraocular pressure (IOP). Preclinical research has suggested that enhancing mitochondrial function and energy production may enhance retinal ganglion cell survival in animal models of glaucoma, but there is scant information on its effectiveness in a clinical setting. Objective: To test the hypothesis that a combination of nicotinamide and pyruvate can improve retinal ganglion cell function in human glaucoma as measured with standard automated perimetry. Design, Setting, and Participants: In this phase 2, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial at a single academic institution, 197 patients were assessed for eligibility. Of these, 42 patients with treated open-angle glaucoma and moderate visual field loss in at least 1 eye were selected for inclusion and randomized. A total of 32 completed the study and were included in the final analysis. The mean (SD) age was 64.6 (9.8) years. Twenty-one participants (66%) were female. Participant race and ethnicity data were collected via self-report to ensure the distribution reflected that observed in clinical practice in the US but are not reported here to protect patient privacy. Recruitment took place in April 2019 and patients were monitored through December 2020. Data were analyzed from January to May 2021. Interventions: Ascending oral doses of nicotinamide (1000 to 3000 mg) and pyruvate (1500 to 3000 mg) vs placebo (2:1 randomization). Main Outcomes and Measures: Number of visual field test locations improving beyond normal variability in the study eye. Secondary end points were the rates of change of visual field global indices (mean deviation [MD], pattern standard deviation [PSD], and visual field index [VFI]). Results: Twenty-two of 29 participants (76%) randomized to the intervention group and 12 of 13 participants (92%) randomized to placebo received their allocation, and 32 participants (32 eyes; ratio 21:11) completed the study (21 from the intervention group and 11 from the placebo group). Median (IQR) follow-up time was 2.2 (2.0-2.4) months. No serious adverse events were reported during the study. The number of improving test locations was significantly higher in the treatment group than in the placebo group (median [IQR], 15 [6-25] vs 7 [6-11]; P =.005). Rates of change of PSD suggested improvement with treatment compared with placebo (median, -0.06 vs 0.02 dB per week; 95% CI, 0.02 to 0.24; P =.02) but not MD (0.04 vs -0.002 dB per week; 95% CI, -0.27 to 0.09; P =.35) or VFI (0.09 vs -0.02% per week; 95% CI, -0.53 to 0.36; P =.71). Conclusions and Relevance: A combination of nicotinamide and pyruvate yielded significant short-term improvement in visual function, supporting prior experimental research suggesting a role for these agents in neuroprotection for individuals with glaucoma and confirming the need for long-term studies to establish their usefulness in slowing progression.

Results: The average age was 24\u00c2\u00a0years, and mean canister consumption was 148 per day for 9\u00c2\u00a0months. At presentation, paresthesias and gait unsteadiness were common, and seven patients were bedbound. Mean serum B12 was normal (258\u00c2\u00a0pmol/L, normal range [NR]\u00c2\u00a0=\u00c2\u00a0140\u00e2\u20ac\u201c750) as was active B12 (87\u00c2\u00a0pmol/L, normal\u00c2\u00a0>\u00c2\u00a035).

Three of the seven patients who were bedbound at presentation were able to walk again with an aid at discharge. Of eight patients with follow-up data, most had persistent paresthesias and/or sensory ataxia.

Introduction: Pneumocystis pneumonia is a common opportunistic infection in patients with HIV/AIDS, and is a leading cause of death in this population. Early selection of effective treatment is therefore critical to reduce mortality. We conducted a clinical trial to compare the effectiveness and safety of three different antifungal treatment regimens in HIV-infected patients with moderate to severe PCP. Methods: Our study was a multicenter, observational prospective clinical trial. We recruited 320 HIV-infected patients with moderate to severe PCP, and stratified these subjects into a trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX) monotherapy group, a TMP-SMX plus clindamycin group, and a TMP-SMX plus caspofungin group. Patients were invited to participate in 12\u00c2\u00a0weeks of follow-up. Outcomes included the difference in overall mortality and the proportion of overall positive response to treatment in the three groups at weeks\u00c2\u00a04 and 12, the difference in treatment duration, and the proportion of adverse events among the three groups during the study period. Results: The probability of survival not statistically different among three treatment groups. Mortality in the TMP-SMX monotherapy group (group\u00c2\u00a01) was 15/115 (13.04%) vs. 20/83 (24.10%) in the TMP-SMX plus clindamycin group (group\u00c2\u00a02) vs. 24/107 (22.43%) in the TMP-SMX plus caspofungin group (group\u00c2\u00a03) at week\u00c2\u00a012 (p = 0.092). The overall positive response rate to treatment in the three groups was 24.14%, 34.94%, and 38.32%, respectively, at week\u00c2\u00a04, and 33.91%, 38.55%, and 44.86%, respectively, at week\u00c2\u00a012. No significant difference in the overall positive response rate to treatment at either week\u00c2\u00a04 or week\u00c2\u00a012 was noted (p = 0.061, p = 0.246). Rates of changes to therapy were 6.50% (8/123) in group\u00c2\u00a01, 3.40% (3/87) in group\u00c2\u00a02, and 2.70% (3/110) in group\u00c2\u00a03, and did not differ significantly among the three groups (p = 0.376). There were also no significant differences in adverse events among the three treatment groups of patients with moderate to severe PCP. Conclusions: Our results indicate that there are no significant statistical differences among the three studied treatment regimens in terms of antifungal effectiveness in HIV-infected patients with moderate to severe PCP. TMP-SMX monotherapy is a convenient, cheap, and effective therapeutic drug regimen to treat HIV-infected patients with moderate to severe PCP, and is an appropriate treatment strategy in resource-limited settings.

We compared the efficacy of transdermal immunization using the particulate formulation of the vaccine to that of traditional subcutaneous immunization using soluble and particulate vaccine. The microparticles were formulated using the biocompatible and biodegradable bovine serum albumin (BSA)-based polymer matrix. These vaccine microparticles were non-cytotoxic to the antigen presenting cells (APCs) and could effectively stimulate the innate immune response, confirmed by release of nitric oxide (NO) from the Griess's assay. The APCs when exposed to vaccine microparticles also showed a significantly higher expression of antigen-presenting molecules, MHC I and MHC II, and their co-stimulatory molecules, CD80 and CD40 as compared to the blank microparticles. The microparticulate measles vaccine was evaluated in vivo in the murine model.

Background. Neuropathic pain is a debilitating disease with few effective treatments. Emerging evidence indicates the involvement of mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative stress in neuropathic pain. Nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) is a potent regulator of the antioxidant response system. In this study, we investigated whether RTA-408 (RTA, a novel synthetic triterpenoid under clinical investigation) could activate Nrf2 and promote mitochondrial biogenesis (MB) to reverse neuropathic pain and the underlying mechanisms. Methods. Neuropathic pain was induced by chronic constriction injury (CCI) of the sciatic nerve. Pain behaviors were measured via the von Frey test and Hargreaves plantar test. The L4-6 spinal cord was collected to examine the activation of Nrf2 and MB. Results. RTA-408 treatment significantly reversed mechanical allodynia and thermal hyperalgesia in CCI mice in a dose-dependent manner. Furthermore, RTA-408 increased the activity of Nrf2 and significantly restored MB that was impaired in CCI mice in an Nrf2-dependent manner. Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma coactivator-1alpha (PGC-1\u00ce\u00b1) is the key regulator of MB. We found that the PGC-1\u00ce\u00b1 activator also induced a potent analgesic effect in CCI mice. Moreover, the antinociceptive effect of RTA-408 was reversed by the preinjection of the PGC-1\u00ce\u00b1 inhibitor. Conclusions. Nrf2 activation attenuates chronic constriction injury-induced neuropathic pain via induction of PGC-1\u00ce\u00b1-mediated mitochondrial biogenesis in the spinal cord. Our results indicate that Nrf2 may be a potential therapeutic strategy to ameliorate neuropathic pain and many other disorders with oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction.\n",

            "premise": "Nusinersen for Spinal Muscular Atrophy in the United States: Findings From a Retrospective Claims Database Analysis. Introduction: Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) is a rare, genetic neuromuscular disorder caused by deletion/mutation of the survival motor neuron 1 gene, characterized by progressive loss of motor neurons, resulting in increasing muscular weakness, deteriorating motor function, and, in its most severe form, death before 2\u00c2\u00a0years. Nusinersen, an antisense oligonucleotide that increases expression of the functional SMN protein, was approved for SMA by US and European regulatory agencies in 2016 and 2017, respectively. The indicated regimen requires intrathecal injections every 4\u00c2\u00a0months, following the first four injections during the loading phase. Adherence is integral to treatment success. Adherence to nusinersen may pose particular challenges as most patients with SMA are young children who require complex multidisciplinary care (including ongoing intrathecal treatment administration and potential specialized anesthetic and surgical procedures) at specialized centers. However, real-world data on adherence to nusinersen are limited. Methods: We conducted a retrospective claims database analysis from December 23, 2016, to November 20, 2019, to study nusinersen adherence and discontinuation/persistence in US patients with SMA types 1\u00e2\u20ac\u201c3 who completed the loading phase, and to determine the impact of non-adherence or treatment discontinuation on SMA-related comorbidities, health care resource utilization (HCRU), and costs. Results: We identified 23 patients with SMA type 1, 41 patients with SMA type 2, and 260 patients with SMA type 3 who had completed the loading phase. Deviations from the indicated nusinersen treatment schedule were frequent in real-world usage, with most patients receiving \u00e2\u2030\u00a51 dose outside the scheduled interval. Across SMA types, non-adherent patients were more likely to have had SMA-related comorbidities (e.g., feeding difficulties, dyspnea and respiratory anomalies, and muscle weakness) and greater HCRU. Persistence rates 12\u00c2\u00a0months after treatment initiation for patients with SMA types 1, 2, and 3 were 55.2%, 42.4%, and 54.6%, respectively. Patients who discontinued nusinersen and those who did not had generally similar comorbidity profiles. Discontinuation was associated with greater health care costs across SMA types. Conclusion: Our analysis of claims data indicated that discontinuation and non-adherence to nusinersen treatment were prevalent, and associated with greater frequency of comorbidities, greater HCRU, and increased costs for patients.",

However, it has been suggested that omalizumab should be reserved for highly allergic patients with multiple allergen sensitivities or perennial-only sensitivities. Objective: To examine impact of allergy burden, including number and type of allergen sensitivities, on omalizumab response in a real-world setting. Methods: This post hoc analysis evaluated a subset of omalizumab-treated patients from the Prospective Observational Study to Evaluate Predictors of Clinical Effectiveness in Response to Omalizumab (NCT01922037) who had completed 13 allergen assessments (N=478). Patients were classified by allergen burden (nonsensitized, 1, 2-4, or \u00e2\u2030\u00a55 allergen sensitivities) and type of allergen (nonsensitized, seasonal, perennial, or both). Outcome measures included exacerbation rate vs previous year and improvements in lung function and Asthma Quality of Life Questionnaire (AQLQ). Results: Comparable adjusted exacerbation rates were observed after omalizumab initiation, regardless of number or type of allergen sensitizations (0.56-0.85/y). Improvements in forced expiratory volume in 1 second from baseline at months 6 (0.03-0.09 L) and 12 (\u00e2\u20ac\u201c0.08 to 0.08 L) were also similar across subgroups.

A COVID-19 vaccine that can give early protection is needed to eliminate the viral spread efficiently. Here, we demonstrate the development of a nanoparticle vaccine candidate, REVC-128, in which multiple trimeric spike ectodomains with glycine (G) at position 614 were multimerized onto a nanoparticle. In-vitro characterization of this vaccine confirms its structural and antigenic integrity. In-vivo immunogenicity evaluation in mice indicates that a single dose of this vaccine induces potent serum neutralizing antibody titre at two weeks post-immunization. This is significantly higher than titre caused by trimeric spike protein without nanoparticle presentation. The comparison of serum binding to spike subunits between animals immunized by a spike with and without nanoparticle presentation indicates that nanoparticle prefers the display of spike RBD (Receptor-Binding Domain) over S2 subunit, likely resulting in a more neutralizing but less cross-reactive antibody response. Moreover, a Syrian golden hamster in-vivo model for the SARS-CoV-2 virus challenge was implemented two weeks post a single dose of REVC-128 immunization. The results showed that vaccination protects hamsters against the SARS-CoV-2 virus challenge with evidence of steady body weight, suppressed viral loads and alleviation of tissue damage for protected animals, compared with \u00e2\u02c6\u00bc10% weight loss, high viral loads and tissue damage in unprotected animals.

Introduction: The degree to which opioid-induced hyperalgesia contributes to the pain experience of patients with chronic pain remains relatively undescribed. The objective of this pilot study was to determine if experimental pain responses improve in patients with chronic pain as they undergo a planned opioid taper. Methods: This was a prospective observational study. Seven patients with chronic neuropathic pain on at least 120\u00c2\u00a0mg morphine equivalents/day were enrolled. The participants were followed over the course of an individualized opioid taper to a lower dose. Measures of experimental pain sensitivity, including indicators of central pain modulation, were collected on a biweekly basis; in addition, measures of function and quality of life were collected monthly. The effect of opioid taper on pain responses and functional outcomes over time were examined using longitudinal mixed-effects regression modeling and general linear regression modeling with regularization as a function of baseline dose, end dose, and taper rate. Results: In this small sample of patients undergoing highly individualized and variable opioid taper, the opioid taper was significantly associated with improved pain responses to the cold-pressor test, with the pain threshold on average increasing by 1.14\u00c2\u00a0s every 6\u00c2\u00a0weeks (p = 0.0084, 95% confidence interval [CI] for 6-week change 0.3039\u00e2\u20ac\u201c2.0178) and pain tolerance on average increasing by 2.87\u00c2\u00a0s every 6\u00c2\u00a0weeks (p = 0.0026, 95% CI for 6-week change 1.02\u00e2\u20ac\u201c4.7277). Taper-related changes in central pain modulation were not observed, although conditioned modulation trended toward improvement by the completion of opioid taper. Similarly, no declines in function and quality of life were observed with the opioid taper, suggesting stability despite decreased opioid dose. Conclusions: Opioid taper was associated with improvements in experimental pain responses without a decline in function and quality of life, suggestive of diminished opioid-induced hyperalgesia in this clinical sample.

Background: Oocyte retrieval is a part of in vitro fertilisation (IVF) procedures performed on an ambulatory basis. Total intravenous anaesthesia (TIVA) with opioid is shown to improve quality of recovery (QOR) after ambulatory surgery. Opioid-free anaesthesia (OF) is gaining popularity in recent times as it is associated with lesser post-operative side effects related to opioids. Quality of recovery is considered as one of the principal end points in ambulatory surgery. Aim: To compare quality of recovery using QOR-15 questionnaire between opioid-free TIVA and opioid-based TIVA at 24\u00c2\u00a0h after oocyte retrieval. Settings and Design: A prospective randomised control study. Patients and Methods: Sixty six patients undergoing oocyte retrieval were prospectively selected. They were randomised into two equal group. OF TIVA group with dexmedetomidine (D) and propofol or opioid-based TIVA with fentanyl (F) and propofol. The primary outcome measured was quality of recovery using QOR-15 at 24\u00c2\u00a0h after oocyte retrieval. Secondary outcomes measured were incidence of bradycardia, post-operative nausea and vomiting, usage of rescue analgesia and total consumption of propofol. Results: A statistically significant difference in total QOR-15 was observed between two groups (p value = 0.021) at 24\u00c2\u00a0h post-operatively.

The objective of this research was to optimize the tasted-masked microparticles for orally disintegrating tablets containing donepezil hydrochloride using quality risk assessment and design of experiment approaches. The double emulsion solvent evaporation technique using aminoalkyl methacrylate copolymer (AMC) was used to prepare taste-masked microparticles. Factors affecting the quality of the taste-masked microparticles were analyzed using an Ishikawa diagram. A risk-ranking approach was used to rank the formulation and process risks. Furthermore, the effect of AMC quantity, stirring time, and volume of outer water phase on various responses, such as particle size, the amount of drug dissolved at 5 min (Q5 ) in simulated saliva fluid, and mean dissolution time (MDT) in simulated gastric fluid, was investigated using the Box-Behnken design. The optimized microparticles were then used to prepare orally disintegrating tablets (ODTs) and evaluated by in vitro and in vivo testing. The results demonstrated that particle size was influenced by the AMC amount and stirring time. Q5 was significantly affected by the amount of AMC and the volume of the outer water phase.

It causes a substantial economic burden, mental and physical disabilities, poor quality of life, and high mortality. Limonite is formed when iron-rich materials from the underground emerge and oxidized on the ground surface. It is currently used to purify contaminated water, absorption of irritant gases, and improve livestock breeding. Limonite can change the composition of environmental microbial communities. In the present study, we evaluated whether limonite can ameliorate glucose metabolism abnormalities by remodeling the gut microbiome. Methods: The investigation was performed using mouse models of streptozotocin-induced diabetes mellitus and high-calorie diet-induced metabolic syndrome. Results: Oral limonite supplement was associated with significant body weight recovery, reduced glycemia with improved insulin secretion, increased number of regulatory T cells, and abundant beneficial gut microbial populations in mice with diabetes mellitus compared to control. Similarly, mice with obesity fed with limonite supplements had significantly reduced body weight, insulin resistance, steatohepatitis, and systemic inflammatory response with significant gut microbiome remodeling.

This study characterizes the anti-SARS-CoV-2 efficacy of GS-621763, an oral prodrug of remdesivir parent nucleoside GS-441524.

Twice-daily oral administration of 10 mg/kg GS-621763 reduces SARS-CoV-2 burden to near-undetectable levels in ferrets.

Objectives: Daratumumab is the first anti-CD38 monoclonal antibody (Mab) used to treat myeloma in the newly diagnosed setting and in the relapsed setting. Isatuximab, another Mab targeting a specific epitope on the CD38 receptor, was recently approved in the UK in combination with pomalidomide and dexamethasone (IsaPomDex) to treat myeloma patients who received three prior lines of therapy. However, there is a lack of understanding of whether using a prior anti-CD38 Mab (e.g. daratumumab) can affect the efficacy of another Mab (e.g. isatuximab), when the latter is used to treat a subsequent relapse. Methods: We performed a UK-wide outcomes study of IsaPomDex in the real-world. In this case series, we report a detailed descriptive analysis of the characteristics and clinical outcomes of five IsaPomDex patients in UK routine practice (Patients I to V), with a prior exposure to daratumumab. Results: Age range was 51\u00e2\u20ac\u201c77 years with two patients >70 and three patients <70 years. The cytogenetic risk was standard in two patients, high in two patients and not known in one patient.

Background: Induction chemotherapy (IC) has been associated with a decreased risk of distant metastasis in locally advanced head and neck squamous cell carcinoma. However, its role in the treatment of oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (OPSCC) is not well established. Methods: The outcomes of patients with OPSCC treated with IC followed by concurrent chemoradiation (CRT) were compared with the outcomes of those treated with CRT alone. The primary outcome was overall survival (OS), and the secondary end points were the times to locoregional and distant recurrence. Results: In an existing database, 585 patients met the inclusion criteria: 137 received IC plus CRT, and 448 received CRT. Most patients were positive for human papillomavirus (HPV; 90.9%). Patients receiving IC were more likely to present with a higher T stage, a higher N stage, and low neck disease. The 3-year OS rate was significantly lower in patients receiving IC (75.7%) versus CRT alone (92.9%). In a multicovariate analysis, receipt of IC (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR], 3.4; P <.001), HPV tumor status (aHR, 0.36; P =.002), and receipt of concurrent cetuximab (aHR, 2.7; P =.002) were independently associated with OS. The risk of distant metastasis was also significantly higher in IC patients (aHR, 2.8; P =.001), whereas an HPV-positive tumor status (aHR, 0.44; P =.032) and completion of therapy (aHR, 0.51; P =.034) were associated with a lower risk of distant metastasis. In HPV-positive patients, IC remained associated with distant metastatic progression (aHR, 2.6; P =.004) but not OS.

Methods: In this retrospective trial, we analyzed data of patients with relapsed/refractory lymphoma who received outpatient fractionated ICE between 2011-2017 at a tertiary care center. The three weekly ICE protocol consisted of: ifosfamide 1500 mg/m2 infused over 2 h on days 1\u00e2\u20ac\u201c3, carboplatin (5 AUC) on day 1, and etoposide 100 mg/m2 on days 1\u00e2\u20ac\u201c3.

The combination of chemotherapy with natural products is a common strategy to enhance anticancer effects while alleviating the dose-dependent adverse effects of cancer treatment. Oxymatrine (OMT) has been extensively reported as having anticancer activity. Doxorubicin (DOX) is a chemotherapeutic DNA-damaging agent used for the treatment of carcinoma. In this study, we investigated whether synergistic effects exist with the combination treatment with OMT and DOX using human colorectal cancer cell (CRC) lines and the potential mechanisms involved in in vitro and in vivo activities. The MTT and colony formation assay results showed that compared to either OMT or DOX monotherapy, the combination of OMT + DOX markedly inhibited the growth of HT-29 and SW620 cells. Wound healing assays showed significant inhibition of cell migration with co-treatment, supported by the change in E-cadherin and N-cadherin expressions in Western blotting. Furthermore, flow cytometry analysis revealed that OMT + DOX co-treatment enhanced cell apoptosis as a result of ROS generation, whereas NAC attenuated OMT + DOX\u00e2\u20ac\u201cinduced apoptosis. Similarly, the apoptosis-related proteins (cleaved caspase-3, cleaved caspase-9, and the ratio of Bax/Bcl-2) were determined by Western blotting, which showed that the expressions of these markers were notably increased in the co-treatment group. Furthermore, co-administration of a low dose of DOX and OMT inhibited xenograft tumor growth in a dose-dependent manner. TUNEL assay and Ki67 staining images indicated more apoptosis and less proliferation occurred in OMT plus DOX-treated xenograft tumors. Meanwhile, the combination strategy decreased cardiotoxicity, which is the most serious side effect of DOX. RNA sequencing was performed to explore the precise molecular alterations involved in the combination group. Among the numerous differentially expressed genes, downregulated FHL-2 and upregulated cleaved SPTAN1 were validated in both mRNA and protein levels of HT-29 and SW620 cells. These two proteins might play a pivotal role involving in OMT + DOX synergistic activity.

Introduction: Disease recurrence is an important obstacle in estrogen receptor positive (ER+) tamoxifen treated breast carcinoma patients. Tamoxifen resistance-related molecular mechanisms are not fully understood. Alteration in DNA methylation which contributes to transcriptional regulation of cancer-related genes plays a crucial role in tamoxifen response. In the present study, the contribution of promoter methylation and mRNA expression of PAX2 and AIB1 in the development of breast carcinoma and tamoxifen refractory was assessed. Methods: Methylation specific-high resolution melting (MS-HRM) analysis and Real-time quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) experiment were performed to analyze the promoter methylation and mRNA expression levels of PAX2 and AIB1 genes in 102 breast tumors and adjacent normal breast specimens. Results: We indicated that PAX2 expression is decreased in breast tissues due to hypermethylation in its promoter region. Compared to the adjacent normal tissues, the tumors exhibited significantly lower relative mRNA levels of PAX2 and increased expression of AIB1. Aberrant promoter methylation of PAX2 and overexpression of AIB1 was observed in tamoxifen resistance patients compared to the sensitive ones. Cox regression analysis exhibited that the increased promoter methylation status of PAX2 and overexpression of AIB1 remained as unfavorable identifiers which influence patients' survival independently. Conclusions: Our results revealed that the aberration in PAX2 promoter methylation and AIB1 overexpression are associated with the tamoxifen response in breast carcinoma patients. Further research is needed to demonstrate the potential of using PAX2 and AIB1 expression and their methylation-mediated regulation as predictive or prognostic biomarkers or as a new target therapy for better disease management.",

Breast cancer is the leading cause of cancer death among women and almost all of the breast cancer-caused mortality is related to metastasis.

Paclitaxel is one of the important drugs in the treatment of breast cancer. Mifepristone combined with paclitaxel could be an effective strategy for inhibiting breast cancer metastasis. However, their inherent defects, in terms of short blood circulation half-life and lack of tumor targeting, not only limit their effectiveness but also cause adverse reactions. Therefore, our aim is to explore a novel protocol against breast cancer metastasis, further optimize its therapeutic efficacy by a nanodelivery system, and explore its mechanism. Herein, a paclitaxel-conjugated and mifepristone-loaded hydrogel (PM-nano) was prepared by self-assembly. Its characterizations were studied. The antimetastatic effect was evaluated in vitro and in vivo and its mechanism was also explored by western blot assay. The resultant PM-nano was developed with favorable water solubility and good biocompatibility. Moreover, PM-nano displayed increased cell uptake properties and stimulated drug release in the tumor micro-acidic environment. The PM-nano was more effective in inhibiting the proliferation and metastasis of breast cancer than other groups in vitro and in vivo.

Given limited evidence regarding the CNS penetration of panobinostat, we sought to characterize its BBB penetration in a murine model. Methods: Panobinostat 15\u00c2\u00a0mg/kg was administered IV to 12 CD-1 female mice. At specified time points, mice were euthanized, blood samples were collected, and brains were removed. LC\u00e2\u20ac\u201cMS was performed to quantify panobinostat concentrations. Cmax and AUC were estimated and correlated with previously published pharmacokinetic analyses and reports of IC-50 values in DIPG cell lines. Results: Mean panobinostat plasma concentrations (ng/mL) were 27.3 \u00c2\u00b1 2.5 at 1\u00c2\u00a0h, 7.56 \u00c2\u00b1 1.8 at 2\u00c2\u00a0h, 1.48 \u00c2\u00b1 0.56 at 4\u00c2\u00a0h, and 2.33 \u00c2\u00b1 1.18 at 7\u00c2\u00a0h.

Brain-to-plasma ratio at 1\u00c2\u00a0h was 2.22 and the brain to plasma AUC ratio was 2.63. Based on the published human pharmacokinetic data, the anticipated Cmax in humans is expected to be significantly higher than the IC-50 identified in DIPG models. Conclusion: It is expected that panobinostat would be effective in CNS tumors where the IC-50 is in the low nanomolar range.

Increased expression of histone deacetylases (HDACs) affiliated to the epigenetic regulation is common aberration in prostate cancer (PCa). We have confirmed that hepatocyte cell adhesion molecule (hepaCAM), acting as a tumor suppressor gene, is rarely expressed in PCa previously, However, the mechanisms of which is still unknown. The level of histone acetylation reportedly may involve anti-oncogene transcription and expression. In this study, we investigated the effect of panobinostat, the broad-spectrum histone deacetylases inhibitor, on PCa LNCaP and DU145 cell growth, and observed re-expression of hepaCAM when treated with panobinostat. We demonstrated that intranuclear acetylation of lys9 of histone H3 (Ac-H3K9) were increased, while that of both mRNA and protein of HDAC1, HDAC3, and HDAC4 were decreased when the treating concentration of panobinostat increased. We confirmed the relationship between histone acetylation and the expression of hepaCAM and AR in prostate cancer tissues. We also confirmed that panobinostat could overcome the resistance for androgen deprivation therapy (ADT). Further, we combined panobinostat with Ad-hepaCAM, which resulted in significantly increased antitumor activity and significant attenuation of the proliferation-associated genes CCND1 and PCNA compared to each single treatment. In conclusion, panobinostat may enhance the acetylation of lys9 of histone 3 and reverse the hepaCAM expression through its inhibitory effect on HDACs activity in PCa LNCaP and DU145 cells; Ad-hepaCAM combined with panobinostat may synergistically inhibit the growth of LNCaP and DU145 cells, via a potential mechanism associated with the down-regulation of the expression of CCND1 and PCNA.

Purpose: The approval of immune checkpoint inhibitors for metastatic non-small-cell lung carcinomas (mNSCLC) treatment has presented more care options. Therefore, it is important to identify the benefit-risk trade-offs patients and caregivers are willing to make among potential treatment options. This study quantified the preferences of patients and caregivers for attributes of mNSCLC treatment. Methods: Patients with mNSCLC and caregivers completed an online survey assessing preferences using a discrete choice experiment. Respondents chose between hypothetical treatment profiles, with varying levels for 7 attributes associated with first-line treatment, including overall survival (OS), progression-free survival, select adverse events (AEs), and regimen (caregivers). Hierarchical Bayesian modeling was used to estimate attribute-level preference weights. Results: Patients (n = 308) and caregivers (n = 166) most valued increasing OS from 11 to 30 months, followed by decreasing the risk of a serious AE (grade 3/4) that may lead to hospitalization from 70% to 18%. These attributes were over twice as important to both sets of respondents as the other attributes measured. Patients and caregivers would accept increases in the risks of a serious AE (grade 3/4) from 18% to 70% and all grades nausea from 10% to 69% if OS increased by 16.8 and 4.0 months, respectively. The least valued attributes were all grades of pneumonitis (patients) and all grades of skin rash (caregivers). Conclusion: Patients and caregivers are willing to make trade-offs between efficacy and toxicity and may require up to 1.5 years of increased OS to accept a higher risk of AEs. These results can provide guidance to oncologists when engaging in shared-decision making discussions.",

Background: Oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) has a high prevalence and predicted global mortality rate of 67.1%, necessitating better therapeutic strategies. Moreover, the recurrence and resistance of OSCC after chemo/radioresistance remains a major bottleneck for its effective treatment. Molecular targeting is one of the new therapeutic approaches to target cancer. Among a plethora of targetable signaling molecules, PDK1 is currently rising as a potential target for cancer therapy. Its aberrant expression in many malignancies is observed associated with glycolytic reprogramming and chemo/radioresistance. Methods: Furthermore, to better understand the role of PDK1 in OSCC, we analyzed tissue samples from 62 patients with OSCC for PDK1 expression. Combining in silico and in vitro analysis approaches, we determined the important association between PDK1/CD47/LDHA expression in OSCC. Next, we analyzed the effect of PDK1 expression and its connection with OSCC orosphere generation and maintenance, as well as the effect of the combination of the PDK1 inhibitor BX795, cisplatin and radiotherapy in targeting it. Results: Im-munohistochemical analysis revealed that higher PDK1 expression is associated with a poor prognosis in OSCC. The immunoprecipitation assay indicated PDK1/CD47 binding. PDK1 ligation significantly impaired OSCC orosphere formation and downregulated Sox2, Oct4, and CD133 expres-sion. The combination of BX795 and cisplatin markedly reduced in OSCC cell\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s epithelial-mesen-chymal transition, implying its synergistic effect. p-PDK1, CD47, Akt, PFKP, PDK3 and LDHA protein expression were significantly reduced, with the strongest inhibition in the combination group. Chemo/radiotherapy together with abrogation of PDK1 inhibits the oncogenic (Akt/CD47) and gly-colytic (LDHA/PFKP/PDK3) signaling and, enhanced or sensitizes OSCC to the anticancer drug effect through inducing apoptosis and DNA damage together with metabolic reprogramming.

Introduction: Gaucher disease (GD) is an autosomal recessive lysosomal storage disorder caused by a deficiency of acid \u00ce\u00b2-glucosidase encoded by the GBA gene. In patients with GD, childhood onset parkinsonian features have been rarely described. Methods: Twin siblings with GD are described, including clinical follow-up and treatment response. Bone marrow, enzyme activity studies and genotyping were performed. Results: By age 9 months, symptoms at onset were thrombocytopenia and splenomegaly. By age 2, hypokinesia, bradykinesia and oculomotor apraxia were observed. By age 5 a complete rigid hypokinetic syndrome was stablished in both patients, including bradykinesia, tremor and rigidity. Treatment with imiglucerase, miglustat, ambroxol and levodopa were performed. Levodopa showed a good response with improvement in motor and non-motor skills. Foamy cells were found in the bone marrow study. Glucocerebrosidase activity was 28% and 26%. Sanger sequencing analysis identified a missense mutation and a complex allele (NP_000148: p.[(Asp448His)]; [(Leu422Profs*4)]) in compound heterozygosity in GBA gene. Conclusions: Two siblings with neuronopathic GD with an intermediate form between type 2 and 3, with a systemic and neurological phenotype are described. The complex neurological picture included a hypokinetic-rigid and tremor syndrome that improved with levodopa treatment. These conditions together have not been previously described in pediatric GD. We suggest that in children with parkinsonian features, lysosomal storage disorders must be considered, and a levodopa trial must be performed. Moreover, this report give support to the finding that GBA and parkinsonian features share biological pathways and highlight the importance of lysosomal mechanisms in parkinsonism pathogenesis, what might have therapeutic implications.",

Potent antithrombotic agents are routinely prescribed after percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) to reduce ischemic complications.

We sought to evaluate the association between a history of gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB) and outcomes after PCI. We linked clinical registry data from PCIs performed at 48 Michigan hospitals between 1/2013 and 3/2018 to Medicare claims. We used 1:5 propensity score matching to adjust for patient characteristics. In-hospital outcomes included bleeding, transfusion, stroke or death. Post-discharge outcomes included 90-day all-cause readmission and long-term mortality. Of 30,206 patients, 1.1% had a history of GIB. Patients with a history of GIB were more likely to be older, female, and have more cardiovascular comorbidities. After matching, those with a history of GIB (n = 312) had increased post-procedural transfusions (15.7% vs 8.4%; p < 0.001), bleeding (11.9% vs 5.2%; p < 0.001), and major bleeding (2.8% vs 0.6%; p = 0.004).

Background: The use of electronic clinical decision support (CDS) systems for pediatric critical care trials is rare. We sought to describe in detail the use of a CDS tool (Children's Hospital Euglycemia for Kids Spreadsheet [CHECKS]), for the management of hyperglycemia during the 32 multicenter Heart And Lung Failure-Pediatric Insulin Titration trial. Research Question: In critically ill pediatric patients who were treated with CHECKS, how was user compliance associated with outcomes; and what patient and clinician factors might account for the observed differences in CHECKS compliance? Study Design and Methods: During an observational retrospective study of compliance with a CDS tool used during a prospective randomized controlled trial, we compared patients with high and low CHECKS compliance. We investigated the association between compliance and blood glucose metrics. We describe CHECKS and use a computer interface analysis framework (the user, function, representation, and task analysis framework) to categorize user interactions. We discuss implications for future randomized controlled trials. Results: Over a 4.5-year period, 658 of 698 children were treated with the CHECKS protocol for \u00e2\u2030\u00a524 hours with a median of 119 recommendations per patient. Compliance per patient was high (median, 99.5%), with only 30 patients having low compliance (<90%). Patients with low compliance were from 16 of 32 sites, younger (P = .02), and less likely to be on inotropic support (P = .04). They were more likely to be have been assigned randomly to the lower blood glucose target (80% vs 48%; P < .001) and to have spent a shorter time (53% vs 75%; P < .001) at the blood glucose target. Overrides (classified by the user, function, representation, and task analysis framework), were largely (89%) due to the user with patient factors contributing 29% of the time.

Background: Myeloid cells, especially dendritic cells and macrophages, play important roles in asthma pathophysiology. Monocytes (Mo) and macrophages express protease-activated receptor-2 (PAR-2), a proinflammatory serine protease receptor implicated in the pathophysiology of allergic airway inflammation. We have revealed that patients with severe asthma and those with a history of frequent asthma exacerbations exhibit increased PAR-2 expression on peripheral blood monocytes. Objective: To determine PAR-2 expression on peripheral blood intermediate monocytes (IMMo) in subjects with increased airway inflammation, either as a result of an asthma exacerbation or after an inhalation allergen challenge. Methods: A total of 16 adults who presented to the emergency department with asthma exacerbations were recruited after giving an informed consent. After 2 weeks, 10 patients returned for follow-up. A total of 11 patients with mild asthma treated only with as-needed bronchodilators were recruited and underwent inhalation allergen challenge after providing an informed consent. Immune cell profiling was performed by whole blood flow cytometry in both groups of patients. Results: PAR-2 expression in peripheral blood IMMo increased in patients with an asthma exacerbation compared with those with stable disease, but this expression decreased after treatment of the asthma exacerbation. Subjects with mild asthma had an increase in percentages of IMMo expressing PAR-2 after an allergen challenge. Patients who presented to the emergency department had lower dendritic cell and dendritic cell subset numbers in peripheral blood during exacerbation compared with after treatment. Conclusion: Increased PAR-2 expression on Mo during periods of increased airway inflammation may initiate a positive feedback loop leading to systemic inflammatory changes.",

Tumor-induced osteomalacia (TIO) is a rare cause of hypophosphatemia characterized by vague symptoms of gradual muscle weakness and diffuse bone pain with pathologic fractures that often lead to a delayed diagnosis.

A 61-year-old male was evaluated for persistent hypophosphatemia and presumed osteomalacia. Six years earlier, he underwent surgical excision of a left ischial mass after presenting with TIO. The pathology was consistent with a PMT; however, hypophosphatemia persisted suggesting incomplete resection. He was treated with calcitriol and phosphate salts.

Background: The neddylation pathway is aberrantly overactivated in multiple human cancers and has been indicated as an effective target for anticancer therapy in clinical trials. We aimed to study whether the neddylation pathway is upregulated in pancreatic cancer and whether pevonedistat, a first-in-class anticancer agent specifically targeting this pathway, will suppress cancer tumorigenesis and progression. Methods: We evaluated the expression pattern of neddylation pathway components in 179 pancreatic adenocarcinoma (PAAD) compared with 171 normal tissues from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) dataset and further assessed PAAD patient prognosis with high neddylation pathway expression via Gene Expression Profiling Interactive Analysis (GEPIA). We then analyzed malignant cancer phenotypes both in vitro and in vivo, as well as intrinsic molecular mechanisms upon pevonedistat treatment. Results: We found that the neddylation pathway was hyperactivated in pancreatic cancer. Patients with high neddylation pathway expression exhibited worse prognoses. Pevonedistat significantly inhibited the cancer cell cycle, cell growth, and proliferation; increased cell apoptosis; and decreased cancer cell xenografts in a mouse model. Mechanistically, pevonedistat treatment and the siRNA knockdown neddylation pathway were able to remarkably induce the accumulation of Wee1, p27, and p21. Further mechanistic studies revealed that pevonedistat mainly impaired the ubiquitination level and delayed the protein degradation of Wee1, p27, and p21. Conclusions: Our results showed that pevonedistat targeted the overexpression of the neddylation pathway in pancreatic cancer to induce cell growth suppression by inducing the accumulation of the cell cycle regulators Wee1, p27, and p21, which provides sound evidence for the clinical trial of pevonedistat for pancreatic cancer therapy.",

Methods: Eligible patients were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to control group and intervention group. The control group received routine education and support, while the intervention group received additional individualized pharmacist-led care. The primary endpoint was treatment adherence in the per-protocol analysis, as evaluated by blinded assessors. An interim analysis was planned when 30% patients completed the study.

This study examined whether genetic variations in a relevant drug-metabolizing enzyme (CYP2D6), transporter (ABCB1), or receptor (5-HT3) were associated with ondansetron failure. Methods: DNA was extracted from blood and used to genotype: ABCB1 (3435C > T (rs1045642) and G2677A/T (rs2032582)), 5-HT3RB (rs3758987 T > C and rs45460698 (delAAG/dupAAG)), and CYP2D6 variants. Ondansetron failure was determined by review of the medical records and by patient-reported outcomes (PROs). Results: One hundred twenty-nine patients were approached; 103 consented. Participants were less than 1 to 33\u00c2\u00a0years (mean 6.85). A total of 39.8% was female, 58.3% was White (22.3% Black, 19.4% other), and 24.3% was Hispanic. A majority had leukemia or lymphoma, and 41 (39.8%) met the definition of ondansetron failure. Of variants tested, rs45460698 independently showed a significant difference in risk of ondansetron failure between a mutant (any deletion) and normal allele (p = 0.0281, OR 2.67). Age and BMI were both predictive of ondansetron failure (age > 12 (OR 1.12, p = 0.0012) and higher BMI (OR 1.13, p = 0.0119)). In multivariate analysis, age > 12 was highly predictive of ondansetron failure (OR 7.108, p = 0.0008). rs45460698 was predictive when combined with an increased nausea phenotype variant of rs1045642 (OR 3.45, p = 0.0426).

Subcutaneous drug administration can facilitate this therapy in outpatient setting, but there is limited information about this practice. We have developed an original approach for drug dosing in this context, based on therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) and pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) principles. The objective of this study was to describe our approach and its first results in a case series. We analyzed data from patients who received suppressive antibiotic therapy by subcutaneous (SC) route with beta-lactams as salvage therapy for prosthetic joint infection (PJI) and had TDM with PK/PD-based dose adjustment. Ten patients (six women and four men with a mean age of 77 years) were included from January 2017 to May 2020. The drugs administered by SC route were ceftazidime (n = 4), ertapenem (n = 4), and ceftriaxone (n = 2). In each patient, PK/PD-guided dosage individualization was performed based on TDM and minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) measurements. The dose interval could be prolonged from twice daily to thrice weekly in some patients, while preserving the achievement of PK/PD targets. The infection was totally controlled by the strategy in nine out the 10 patients during a median follow-up of 1,035 days (~3 years). No patient acquired carbapenem-resistant Gram-negative bacteria during the follow-up. One patient presented treatment failure with acquired drug resistance under therapy, which could be explained by late MIC determination and insufficient exposure, retrospectively.

Our aim was to assess the pharmacokinetics (PK) and toxicokinetics (TK) of AH following oral administration in Sprague Dawley rats and Beagle dogs by using the liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry methods (LC-MS/MS). The PK studies were carried out in eighteen rats at three doses and six dogs at three rounds of three doses after a single oral administration of AH. The TK studies in rats and dogs were accompanied by the 14-day repeated dosing studies. The PK results revealed that artemisinin was absorbed and cleared rapidly in rats with obvious gender difference and interindividual variability, and the systemic exposure with regard to AUC was positively correlated with the dosage in female rats. However, the kinetics parameters of artemisinin in dogs were not obtained because the plasma concentration was undetectable. The absorption and elimination of hydroxychloroquine in dogs and rats were relatively slow, and no gender difference was observed. The AUC of hydroxychloroquine showed a linear correlation with the dosage, but Cmax varied significantly among individuals. After 14-day repeated oral administration of AH, hydroxychloroquine shows an increase in systemic exposure and accumulation in rats and dogs, whereas the AUC and Cmax of artemisinin remarkably decreased in female rats due to its autoinduction metabolism.

Sepsis and septic shock are associated with high mortality and are considered one of the major public health concerns. The onset of sepsis is known as a hyper-inflammatory state that contributes to organ failure and mortality. Recent findings suggest a potential role of two non-receptor protein tyrosine kinases, namely Focal adhesion kinase (FAK) and Proline-rich tyrosine kinase 2 (Pyk2), in the inflammation associated with endometriosis, cancer, atherosclerosis and asthma. Here we investigate the role of FAK-Pyk2 in the pathogenesis of sepsis and the potential beneficial effects of the pharmacological modulation of this pathway by administering the potent reversible dual inhibitor of FAK and Pyk2, PF562271 (PF271) in a murine model of cecal ligation and puncture (CLP)-induced sepsis. Five-month-old male C57BL/6 mice underwent CLP or Sham surgery and one hour after the surgical procedure, mice were randomly assigned to receive PF271 (25 mg/kg, s.c.) or vehicle. Twenty-four hours after surgery, organs and plasma were collected for analyses. In another group of mice, survival rate was assessed every 12\u00c2\u00a0h over the subsequent 5 days. Experimental sepsis led to a systemic cytokine storm resulting in the formation of excessive amounts of both pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNF-\u00ce\u00b1, IL-1\u00ce\u00b2, IL-17 and IL-6) and the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10. The systemic inflammatory response was accompanied by high plasma levels of ALT, AST (liver injury), creatinine, (renal dysfunction) and lactate, as well as a high, clinical severity score. All parameters were attenuated following PF271 administration. Experimental sepsis induced an overactivation of FAK and Pyk2 in liver and kidney, which was associated to p38 MAPK activation, leading to increased expression/activation of several pro-inflammatory markers, including the NLRP3 inflammasome complex, the adhesion molecules ICAM-1, VCAM-1 and E-selectin and the enzyme NOS-2 and myeloperoxidase. Treatment with PF271 inhibited FAK-Pyk2 activation, thus blunting the inflammatory abnormalities orchestrated by sepsis. Finally, PF271 significantly prolonged the survival of mice subjected to CLP-sepsis. Taken together, our data show for the first time that the FAK-Pyk2 pathway contributes to sepsis-induced inflammation and organ injury/dysfunction and that the pharmacological modulation of this pathway may represents a new strategy for the treatment of sepsis.",

We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of the effects of psychopharmacologic and somatic therapies on suicide risk. Methods: A systematic search of MEDLINE for studies evaluating the effects of pharmacologic (excluding antidepressants) or somatic interventions on suicide risk was conducted. Studies were included if they used a comparison group, reported on suicide death, assessed a psychopharmacological or somatic intervention, and included adults. Study quality was assessed using the Newcastle\u00e2\u20ac\u201cOttawa scale. Fifty-seven studies were included from 2940 reviewed citations. Results: In bipolar disorder, lithium was associated with a reduction in the odds of suicide compared to active controls (odds ratio [OR] =.58, p =.005; k = 12) and compared to placebo/no lithium (OR =.46, p =.009; k = 9).

The use of the BRAF inhibitor vemurafenib exhibits drug resistance in the treatment of thyroid cancer (TC), and finding more effective multitarget combination therapies may be an important solution. In the present study, we found strong correlations between Ref-1 high expression and BRAF mutation, lymph node metastasis, and TNM stage. The oxidative stress environment induced by structural activation of BRAF upregulates the expression of Ref-1, which caused intrinsic resistance of PTC to vemurafenib. Combination inhibition of the Ref-1 redox function and BRAF could enhance the antitumor effects of vemurafenib, which was achieved by blocking the action of Ref-1 on BRAF proteins. Furthermore, combination treatment could cause an overload of autophagic flux via excessive AMPK protein activation, causing cell senescence and cell death in vitro. And combined administration of Ref-1 and vemurafenib in vivo suppressed PTC cell growth and metastasis in a cell-based lung metastatic tumor model and xenogeneic subcutaneous tumor model. Collectively, our study provides evidence that Ref-1 upregulation via constitutive activation of BRAF in PTC contributes to intrinsic resistance to vemurafenib.

ADP-0022-003 was a phase I dose-escalation trial that aimed to evaluate the safety and antitumor activity of ADP-A2M10 in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) (NCT02592577).MethodsEligible patients were HLA-A*02 positive with advanced NSCLC expressing MAGE-A10. Patients underwent apheresis; T cells were isolated, transduced with a lentiviral vector containing the TCR targeting MAGE-A10, and expanded. Patients underwent lymphodepletion with varying doses/schedules of fludarabine and cyclophosphamide prior to receiving ADP-A2M10.

Methods: This single-arm, open-label, multicenter, phase II study included elderly patients aged 65\u00c2\u00a0years or more who had fluoropyrimidine-refractory advanced colorectal cancer and received trifluridine/tipiracil (70\u00c2\u00a0mg/m2, days 1\u00e2\u20ac\u201c5 and 8\u00e2\u20ac\u201c12, every 4\u00c2\u00a0weeks). The primary endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS), while secondary endpoints included overall survival (OS), overall response rate (ORR), toxicities, association between efficacy and geriatric assessment scores, and association between toxicity and plasma drug concentrations. Results: A total of 30 patients with a mean age of 73\u00c2\u00a0years were enrolled. Median PFS was 2.3\u00c2\u00a0months (95% confidence interval, 1.9\u00e2\u20ac\u201c4.3\u00c2\u00a0months), while median OS was 5.7\u00c2\u00a0months (95% confidence interval, 3.7\u00e2\u20ac\u201c8.9\u00c2\u00a0months). Patients had an ORR of 0%, with 57% having stable disease. Grade 4 neutropenia was observed in 13% of the patients.

Introduction Management of neuropathic cancer pain (NCP) refractory to regular opioids remains an important challenge. The efficacy of pregabalin for NCP except chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN) has already been confirmed in two randomised controlled trials (RCTs) compared with placebo. Duloxetine offers the potential of analgesia in opioid refractory NCP. However, there are no RCT of duloxetine for the management of opioid-refractory NCP as a first line treatment. Both classes of drugs have the potential to reduce NCP, but there has been no head-to-head comparison for the efficacy and safety, especially given differing side effect profiles. Methods and analysis An international, multicentre, double-blind, dose increment, parallel-arm, RCT is planned.

While PARP inhibitor (PARPi) therapies have shown promising results in the treatment of high-grade serous ovarian cancer (HGSOC) harboring homologous recombination deficiencies, primary resistance to PARPi frequently occurs and even initial responders may eventually become resistant. Therefore, the development of novel effective combinatorial strategies to treat HGSOC is urgently needed. Here, we report that H2O2-induced oxidative stress sensitized HGSOC cells to PARPi BMN 673. Furthermore, Phenethyl isothiocyanate (PEITC) as a ROS-inducing agent significantly enhanced the cytotoxic effects of BMN 673. Mechanistically, combined use of PEITC and BMN 673 resulted in ROS overproduction and accumulation, enhanced DNA damage, G2/M arrest and apoptosis, all of which were significantly reversed by the ROS scavenger N-Acetyl-L-cysteine. We also showed that while PEITC did not further enhance the ability of BMN 673 on PARP1 trapping in HGSOC cells, the therapeutic effects of the PEITC/BMN 673 combination were at least in part dependent on the presence of PARP1. Importantly, the PEITC/BMN 673 combination potently abrogated the growth of HGSOC tumor spheroids and patient-derived organoid models of HGSOC and cervical cancer.

Introduction/Aims: Electromyography (EMG) can provide valuable insights into the pathophysiology of oropharyngeal muscles in various disease states, but the invasive nature of the conventional needle EMG (nEMG) has its limitations in this setting. We aimed to examine the inter-rater reliability (IRR) of a novel transmembranous EMG (tmEMG) sensor as a non-invasive technique for assessment of oral cavity and oropharyngeal muscles for neuromuscular pathology. Methods: The study was a prospective, cohort, pilot study with blinded data analysis in healthy participants (n\u00c2\u00a0=\u00c2\u00a06), patients with moderate to severe obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) (n\u00c2\u00a0=\u00c2\u00a05) and bulbar amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) (n\u00c2\u00a0=\u00c2\u00a05). Each patient underwent sampling from bilateral palatoglossus (PG) and genioglossus (GG), using both tmEMG and nEMG. IRR was expressed as percentage agreement and prevalence-adjusted bias-adjusted kappa coefficient (PABAK). Results: Substantial IRR was found for participants with ALS (81.6%, PABAK 0.63) and OSA (78.8%, PABAK 0.61), and in healthy participants (87.1%, PABAK 0.74). A better IRR was seen with tmEMG (95.7%, PABAK 0.92) than with nEMG (73.9%, PABAK 0.48) for healthy participants and also for those with OSA. Studies from GG had higher IRR than PG. Only one participant had a minor adverse event (sore throat). Discussion: The current study shows that analysis of PG and GG in both healthy and disease states using tmEMG has high IRR compared with nEMG analysis. Further validation studies can be undertaken to test its utility in analysis of oral cavity and oropharyngeal muscles.",

Neurodegeneration and impaired neural development are a common feature of many neuropsychiatric disorders. Second-generation antipsychotics (SGAs) and certain atypical antidepressants display neuroprotective effects. Though these drugs interact with many molecular targets, a common shared attribute is high antagonist potency at 5-HT2A receptors. Pimavanserin is a selective 5-HT2A inverse agonist/antagonist that was recently FDA approved for treating hallucinations and delusions associated with Parkinson's disease. Unlike SGAs, pimavanserin lacks activity at other targets like dopamine, histamine, muscarinic, and adrenergic receptors. To investigate whether selective 5-HT2A inverse agonists have neuroprotective properties, pimavanserin and another selective 5-HT2A inverse agonist, M100907, were applied to primary cultures of dopaminergic neurons treated with 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium (MPP+). Both pimavanserin and M100907 protected dopaminergic neurons against MPP+-induced cell death. The neuroprotective effects of pimavanserin required signaling through the extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 pathway, restored mitochondrial function, and reduced oxidative stress. Further investigation showed that pimavanserin promotes the release of brain-derived neurotrophic factor and glial-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) and that the neuroprotective effects of pimavanserin were blocked by antibodies to GDNF but not by anti-tyrosine receptor kinase B receptor antibodies. Thus, pimavanserin induces release of neurotrophic factors and protects dopaminergic neurons against MPP+ toxicity in a GDNF-dependent manner.\n",

The expression of PEDF, VEGF, and GLUT-1 were analyzed upon pyrogallol-O-sulfate treatment in RPE cells under high glucose and hypoxia. To test its effect on a diabetic mouse model, Ins2Akita mice were subjected to a single intraocular injection of the metabolite and the expression of PEDF, VEGF, GLUT-1, Iba1, or GFAP measured in the neural retina and/or retinal pigment epithelium (RPE), two weeks after treatment. We observed a significant decrease in the expression of pro-angiogenic VEGF in RPE cells.

Objectives: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the influence of augmented renal clearance (ARC) on vancomycin clearance and provide dosage recommendations for paediatric patients with febrile neutropenia following HSCT. Methods: A population pharmacokinetic analysis was performed based on a two-compartment model structure using a non-linear mixed-effect modelling approach. Monte Carlo simulations were conducted as a target attainment analysis of AUC between 400 mg\u00c2\u00b7h/L and 650 mg\u00c2\u00b7h/L for MRSA at an MIC of 1 mg/L. Results: A total of 165 paediatric patients and 276 vancomycin serum concentrations were analysed in this study. Age, body weight, estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) and fever (\u00e2\u2030\u00a538.0\u00c2\u00b0C) were identified as factors that significantly influenced vancomycin clearance.

Our simulations showed that current dosing recommendations result in poor target attainment. In particular, children aged 6 months old to 6 years old with ARC require an initial vancomycin dose up to 35%-65% higher than the current dosing guidelines. Conclusions: ARC is frequently observed in paediatric patients with post-HSCT febrile neutropenia, resulting in a significant increase in vancomycin clearance.

PB2452, a neutralizing monoclonal antibody fragment that binds the antiplatelet drug ticagrelor with high affinity, is being developed as a ticagrelor reversal agent. To identify a clinically useful intravenous (i.v.) reversal regimen, a semimechanistic exposure-response model was developed during the PB2452 first-in-human phase I study. From a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, single-dose trial to evaluate the safety, efficacy, and pharmacokinetics (PKs) of PB2452 in 61 healthy volunteers pretreated with ticagrelor, sequential dose cohort data were used to build and refine an exposure-response model that combined population PK models for ticagrelor (TICA), ticagrelor active metabolite (TAM), and PB2452, and related their binding relationships to the PK of uncomplexed TICA and TAM which is predictive of platelet inhibition. Platelet function was assessed by multiple assays. The model was developed using Bayesian methods in NONMEM. Human PK and pharmacodynamic data from sequential dose cohorts were used to initially define and then refine model parameters. Model simulations indicated that an initial i.v. bolus of PB2452, followed by a high-rate infusion, and then a slower-rate infusion would provide immediate and sustained reversal of the antiplatelet effects of ticagrelor.

In this study, we compared the differences between PPs and finasteride in treating CNP, especially their effects on the gut microbiota. Results showed that both PPs and finasteride significantly reduced the prostate weight and prostate index of CNP rats, and improved the histological damages in the inflamed prostate.

Neurologists assessed the patients\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 clinical presentation, radiological investigations, and laboratory findings. Results: Three patients who received the first dose of the Vaxzevria vaccine experienced severe cerebral venous thrombosis, two of them were complicated by intracranial hemorrhage. Their laboratory investigations showed very high d-dimers and severe thrombocytopenia, which have been linked to higher mortality and poor outcome. Ischemic stroke occurred in eight cases (44.4%) with a predominance in older male patients. Three patients presented with seizures, two had optic neuritis. Guillain\u00e2\u20ac\u201cBarr\u00c3\u00a9 syndrome (GBS) and Miller Fisher syndrome (MFS) occurred in two male patients following vaccination with Comirnaty. Conclusion: Neurological complications after COVID-19 vaccinations are very rare, and only a few cases have been reported worldwide. The shared pathophysiological basis between COVID-19 viral infection and COVID-19 vaccines stands behind the very rare neurological complications resulting from the hypercoagulable state triggered by the general inflammatory condition. We suspect some differences in the pathogenesis of ischemic stroke caused by COVID-19 infection and COVID-19 vaccines, which render COVID-19 vaccine-associated ischemic stroke more responsive to treatment. To date, no definitive association between the vaccine and GBS has been proven by any strong evidence, but it has recently been added as a very rare side effect of the Janssen COVID-19 vaccine.

Background: Postinfection irritable bowel syndrome (PI-IBS) affects 14% patients after acute bacterial enterocolitis. Aim: The aim of this study was to conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis to find the prevalence of PI-IBS following Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI). Methods: We systematically searched Medline, Embase, and Web of Science from inception through January 20, 2020 for cohort studies assessing PI-IBS following CDI. Primary outcome was pooled prevalence calculated using inverse variance heterogeneity model [MetaXL (v. 5.3)]. A priori subgroup analyses were done [by irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) diagnostic criteria-Rome vs. others, time of IBS diagnosis-<6 or >6 mo, exclusion or inclusion of pre-existing IBS and CDI treatment-antibiotic with fecal microbiota transplantation vs. antibiotic only]. Heterogeneity was considered substantial if I 2>50%. Results: From 2007 to 2019, 15 studies were included (10 prospective, 5 retrospective; 9 full-text, 6 abstracts). Data from 1218 patients were included in the quantitative analysis. Risk of bias was low in 7, medium in 4 and high in 4 studies.

Subgroup analyses by IBS diagnostic criteria, time of IBS diagnosis or CDI treatment did not significantly change the primary outcome (all P>0.05), nor decrease heterogeneity. Funnel plot analysis revealed publication bias. Conclusions: Over 20% of patients develop PI-IBS after CDI.

Background: Histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors have been shown in preclinical studies to upregulate norepinephrine transporters in neuroblastoma and pheochromocytoma, and somatostatin receptors in pulmonary carcinoid, small cell lung cancer, and pancreatic neuroendocrine malignancies. This pilot imaging study in humans focuses on midgut neuroendocrine carcinoma metastatic to the liver, evaluating the effect of pretreatment with the HDAC inhibitor vorinostat on uptake of 123I-MIBG and 68Ga-DOTATOC. Materials and Methods: Multiple midgut neuroendocrine liver metastases in clinically stable subjects were imaged with 123I-MIBG and 68Ga-DOTATOC before and after a 4-d course of vorinostat. Scans were performed with strict attention to detail and timed about 1 month apart occurring just before monthly long-acting octreotide administrations. Uptake changes in tumor and normal liver parenchyma were assessed on positron emission computed tomography (PET/CT) with standardized uptake values and on single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) with qualitative ratio images. Results: The experimental units were metastatic liver lesions within patients (n = 50). There was no significant difference in administered activity or uptake time between pairs of scans for either radiotracer. Statistically significant increase in maximum standardized uptake values (SUVmax) averaged over all lesions was noted on the 68Ga-DOTATOC PET scans (+11%, p < 0.01). SUVmax in normal liver showed no significant change (p = 0.12). There was no qualitative change in uptake of 123I-MIBG after vorinostat. Conclusions: In this pilot imaging study in patients with midgut neuroendocrine liver metastases, a short course of the HDAC inhibitor vorinostat induced a statistically significant increase in SUVmax on 68Ga-DOTATOC PET/computed tomography (CT) imaging in some hepatic neuroendocrine tumor metastases. There was no significant effect of vorinostat on tumor uptake of 123I-MIBG on SPECT/CT imaging.

Methods: We established the PCOS rat model, the serum hormones including TSP-1 expression were determined and morphological characteristics were investigated to evaluate the model. These above endocrine and morphological features were investigated again to evaluate the effect of TSP-1 treatment. Results: In the PCOS model group, the serum hormones change (higher luteinizing hormone, testosterone and estrogen) and decreased TSP-1 expression levels were found compared with the control group. Besides, the morphological characteristics of PCOS were also observed in the model group. After TSP-1 treatment, the higher TSP-1, ANGPT2, PDGFB and PDGFD expression levels, the lower LH and T levels, decreased vessel density as well as VEGFA and ANGPT1 expression levels were found compared with the control group, and the ovary morphological changes were also observed in the TSP-1 experimental group.

Direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) are being increasingly used in general and cancer populations. However, DOAC safety and efficacy in MPN patients remains unclear. We characterized real-world practice patterns of DOAC use in MPN patients and evaluated thrombosis and bleeding risk. We conducted a retrospective cohort study of 133 MPN patients prescribed DOACs for venous thromboembolism (VTE), atrial fibrillation, or arterial thromboembolism (ATE). Practice patterns including duration of anticoagulation, dosing, and concomitant use of antiplatelet/cytoreductive agents, were heterogeneous among MPN patients.

This survey aimed to investigate these current practices and if the COVID-19 pandemic has changed them. Methods: This study was an open multinational electronic survey directed to physicians working in adult intensive care units (ICUs), which was performed in two steps: before and during the COVID-19 pandemic. Results: We analyzed 1768 questionnaires and 1539 (87%) were complete. Before the COVID-19 pandemic, we received 1476 questionnaires and 292 were submitted later. The following practices were observed before the pandemic: the Visual Analog Scale (VAS) (61.5%), the Behavioral Pain Scale (BPS) (48.2%), the Richmond Agitation Sedation Scale (RASS) (76.6%), and the Confusion Assessment Method for the Intensive Care Unit (CAM-ICU) (66.6%) were the most frequently tools used to assess pain, sedation level, and delirium, respectively; midazolam and fentanyl were the most frequently used drugs for inducing sedation and analgesia (84.8% and 78.3%, respectively), whereas haloperidol (68.8%) and atypical antipsychotics (69.4%) were the most prescribed drugs for delirium treatment; some physicians regularly prescribed drugs to induce sleep (19.1%) or ordered mechanical restraints as part of their routine (6.2%) for patients on mechanical ventilation; non-pharmacological strategies were frequently applied for pain, delirium, and sleep deprivation management.

Depression is one of the strongest predictors of quality of life in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD).

            "premise": "Precision medicine for mood disorders: objective assessment, risk prediction, pharmacogenomics, and repurposed drugs. Mood disorders (depression, bipolar disorders) are prevalent and disabling. They are also highly co-morbid with other psychiatric disorders. Currently there are no objective measures, such as blood tests, used in clinical practice, and available treatments do not work in everybody. The development of blood tests, as well as matching of patients with existing and new treatments, in a precise, personalized and preventive fashion, would make a significant difference at an individual and societal level. Early pilot studies by us to discover blood biomarkers for mood state were promising [1], and validated by others [2]. Recent work by us has identified blood gene expression biomarkers that track suicidality, a tragic behavioral outcome of mood disorders, using powerful longitudinal within-subject designs, validated them in suicide completers, and tested them in independent cohorts for ability to assess state (suicidal ideation), and ability to predict trait (future hospitalizations for suicidality) [3\u00e2\u20ac\u201c6]. These studies showed good reproducibility with subsequent independent genetic studies [7]. More recently, we have conducted such studies also for pain [8], for stress disorders [9], and for memory/Alzheimer\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Disease [10]. We endeavored to use a similar comprehensive approach to identify more definitive biomarkers for mood disorders, that are transdiagnostic, by studying mood in psychiatric disorders patients. First, we used a longitudinal within-subject design and whole-genome gene expression approach to discover biomarkers which track mood state in subjects who had diametric changes in mood state from low to high, from visit to visit, as measured by a simple visual analog scale that we had previously developed (SMS-7). Second, we prioritized these biomarkers using a convergent functional genomics (CFG) approach encompassing in a comprehensive fashion prior published evidence in the field. Third, we validated the biomarkers in an independent cohort of subjects with clinically severe depression (as measured by Hamilton Depression Scale, (HAMD)) and with clinically severe mania (as measured by the Young Mania Rating Scale (YMRS)). Adding the scores from the first three steps into an overall convergent functional evidence (CFE) score, we ended up with 26 top candidate blood gene expression biomarkers that had a CFE score as good as or better than SLC6A4, an empirical finding which we used as a de facto positive control and cutoff. Notably, there was among them an enrichment in genes involved in circadian mechanisms. We further analyzed the biological pathways and networks for the top candidate biomarkers, showing that circadian, neurotrophic, and cell differentiation functions are involved, along with serotonergic and glutamatergic signaling, supporting a view of mood as reflecting energy, activity and growth. Fourth, we tested in independent cohorts of psychiatric patients the ability of each of these 26 top candidate biomarkers to assess state (mood (SMS-7), depression (HAMD), mania (YMRS)), and to predict clinical course (future hospitalizations for depression, future hospitalizations for mania). We conducted our analyses across all patients, as well as personalized by gender and diagnosis, showing increased accuracy with the personalized approach, particularly in women. Again,\u00c2\u00a0using SLC6A4 as the cutoff, twelve top biomarkers had the strongest overall evidence for tracking and predicting depression after all four steps: NRG1, DOCK10, GLS, PRPS1, TMEM161B, GLO1, FANCF, HNRNPDL, CD47, OLFM1, SMAD7, and SLC6A4. Of them, six had the strongest overall evidence for tracking and predicting both depression and mania, hence bipolar mood disorders. There were also two biomarkers (RLP3 and SLC6A4) with the strongest overall evidence for mania. These panels of biomarkers have practical implications for distinguishing between depression and bipolar disorder. Next, we evaluated the evidence for our top biomarkers being targets of existing psychiatric drugs, which permits matching patients to medications in a targeted fashion, and the measuring of response to treatment. We also used the biomarker signatures to bioinformatically identify new/repurposed candidate drugs. Top drugs of interest as potential new antidepressants were pindolol, ciprofibrate, pioglitazone and adiphenine, as well as the natural compounds asiaticoside and chlorogenic acid. The last 3 had also been identified by our previous suicidality studies. Finally, we provide an example of how a report to doctors would look for a patient with depression, based on the panel of top biomarkers (12 for depression and bipolar, one for mania), with an objective depression score, risk for future depression, and risk for bipolar switching, as well as personalized lists of targeted prioritized existing psychiatric medications and new potential medications. Overall, our studies provide objective assessments, targeted therapeutics, and monitoring of response to treatment, that enable precision medicine for mood disorders.",

Severe asthma exacerbations are the primary cause of morbidity and mortality in children with asthma. Accurate prediction of children at risk for severe exacerbations, defined as those requiring systemic corticosteroids, emergency department visit, and/or hospitalization, would considerably reduce health care utilization and improve symptoms and quality of life. Substantial progress has been made in identifying high-risk exacerbation-prone children. Known risk factors for exacerbations include demographic characteristics (ie, low income, minority race/ethnicity), poor asthma control, environmental exposures (ie, aeroallergen exposure/sensitization, concomitant viral infection), inflammatory biomarkers, genetic polymorphisms, and markers from other \u00e2\u20ac\u0153omic\u00e2\u20ac\u009d technologies. The strongest risk factor for a future severe exacerbation remains having had one in the previous year. Combining risk factors into composite scores and use of advanced predictive analytic techniques such as machine learning are recent methods used to achieve stronger prediction of severe exacerbations. However, these methods are limited in prediction efficiency and are currently unable to predict children at risk for impending (within days) severe exacerbations. Thus, we provide a commentary on strategies that have potential to allow for accurate and reliable prediction of children at risk for impending exacerbations. These approaches include implementation of passive, real-time monitoring of impending exacerbation predictors, use of population health strategies, prediction of severe exacerbation responders versus nonresponders to conventional exacerbation management, and considerations for preschool-age children who can be especially high risk.

Methods and results: Receiver operating characteristic curves and logistic regression models were used to evaluate continuous and categorical variables as predictors of sinus rhythm 6 at weeks from cardioversion (end of study). The primary analysis was performed in successfully cardioverted patients with an evaluable electrocardiogram at end of study.

Introduction: Although consistent use of tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) confers significant improvements in long-term survival for individuals with chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), only 70% of CML patients are adherent to TKIs. Understanding the factors that contribute to non-adherence and establishing dynamic adherence patterns in this population are essential aspects of targeted drug monitoring and intervention strategies. Methods: Newly diagnosed CML patients were identified in the MarketScan database and relevant covariate values extracted. Proportion of days covered (PDC) per 30-day interval was used to calculate adherence over a 12-month follow-up period. We conducted a latent profile analysis (LPA) on these PDC estimates to identify distinct, dynamic patterns of TKI adherence. Identified trajectories were grouped into four clinically relevant categories and predictors of membership in these categories were determined via multinomial logistic regression. Results: Four broad adherence categories were identified from the LPA: never adherent, initially non-adherent becoming adherent, initially adherent becoming non-adherent, and stable adherent. Results from the subsequent multinomial logistic regression indicated that younger age, female sex, greater monthly financial burden, fewer comorbidities, fewer concomitant medications, year of diagnosis, higher starting dose, TKI type, and a longer duration from diagnosis to treatment were significantly associated with membership in at least one of the three non-stable adherent groups.

The frequency of first-time complications of cirrhosis was 60% new onset of ascites, 25% overt hepatic encephalopathy (HE), 3% spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP), and 12% acute variceal bleeding. The adherence to guideline-recommended treatment following the initial decompensation was highest for ascites, with 91.3% of patients receiving diuretics. Non-selective beta-blockers following an event of variceal bleeding were prescribed in 69.1% and lactulose and/or rifaximin in 59.1% after a bout of HE. The frequency of prescriptions of antibiotics after SBP was 60.4%. Potenzially harmful prescribed medications included non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs in 15.5%, benzodiazepines in 12.8%, opioids in 9.5%, and proton pump inhibitors in 73.7%. Conclusion Our findings underline the need for intensified efforts to distribute practice guidelines for liver cirrhosis and increase awareness of over-prescribing of potentially harmful medication.",

Purpose: The influence of Hashimoto\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s thyroiditis (HT) on calcitonin (Ct) production is unresolved question. The aim of this study was to explore if basal Ct levels are influenced by the presence/severity of HT or correlated with clinical phenotypes of HT patients. Methods: We included 467 HT patients and 184 control participants, from Croatian Biobank of HT patients (CROHT), in this retrospective study. Calcitonin levels between HT patients and controls were compared using Mann\u00e2\u20ac\u201cWhitney test. Ct levels between two subgroups of HT patients, divided by intake of levothyroxine (LT4) therapy, were additionally tested to take into account the illness severity. Spearman rank correlation test was used to analyze correlations between Ct levels and 14 relevant phenotypes. Results: We have not detected significant differences in median Ct levels between HT patients and controls (2.2 vs 2.35\u00c2\u00a0pg/mL, respectively, P = 0.717) nor in-between two subgroups of HT patients (P = 0.347). We have not detected statistically significant correlations between Ct levels and clinical phenotypes, although we identified three weak nominal correlations: negative correlation of Ct with TgAb in all HT patients (r = \u00e2\u02c6\u2019 0.1, P = 0.04); negative correlation of Ct with age in subgroup of HT patients without LT4 therapy (r = \u00e2\u02c6\u2019 0.13, P = 0.04); positive correlation of Ct with BSA in subgroup of HT patients on LT4 therapy (r = 0.16, P = 0.042). Conclusion: Our results suggest that HT patients of all disease stages preserve Ct production as healthy individuals and there is no need for Ct measurements in the absence of a nodule.

Background: Depressive symptoms are globally recognized as a significant mental health problem in patients with chronic disease, particularly those with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). The purpose of this study was to estimate the prevalence and examine biopsychosocial factors of depressive symptoms among patients with SLE. Methods: This cross-sectional study was conducted among 185 participants diagnosed with SLE and received treatment for at least 3 months, aged 18\u00e2\u20ac\u201c59 years attending the outpatient clinic of a university hospital, Bangkok, Thailand. Depressive symptoms were measured by the Thai version of the Patient Health Questionnaire-9. We assessed Demographic data, the Systemic Lupus Erythematosus Activity Index, the Systemic Lupus International Collaborating Clinics Damage Index, Numeric Rating Scale, Fatigue Severity Scale, Body Image Scale, and the ENRICHD Social Support Instrument. Data were collected from March to May 2021. Multivariable logistic regression was used to analyze the data. Results: The proportion of the participants with depressive symptoms was 43.2%, which 8.1% of those patients presented moderate to severe depressive symptoms. In a multivariable logistic regression model, SLE patients with depressive symptoms were more likely to be severe pain (aOR = 12.11, 95% CI: 1.35, 108.46), fatigue (aOR = 2.36, 95%CI: 1.08, 5.14), taking prednisolone \u00e2\u2030\u00a515 mg daily (aOR = 5.75, 95%CI: 1.76, 18.80), low satisfied of body image (aOR = 12.49, 95%CI: 2.23, 69.80), and low social support (aOR = 17.96, 95% CI: 1.86, 173.77). Disease flare, organ damage, and family income sufficiency did not significantly increase the risk of depressive symptoms in patients with SLE. Conclusions: The findings highlight depressive symptoms in patients with SLE.

Background: Palmoplantar pustulosis (PPP) is a chronic relapsing skin condition characterized by sterile pustules on the palm and soles. Population-based estimates of PPP incidence and prevalence are limited. Objectives: To estimate the prevalence and incidence of PPP in the Swedish general population and to estimate the prevalence of psoriasis vulgaris among the population with PPP. Methods: The Swedish National Patient Register was used, covering all inpatient and outpatient nonprimary care for the Swedish population. We identified cases (2004\u00e2\u20ac\u201c2015) with one International Classification of Diseases 10th Revision diagnostic code (base case) for PPP. The point prevalence estimates at the end of this period (31 December 2015) were obtained by linkage to the Swedish Total Population Register. In sensitivity analyses, we used alternative case definitions: (i) requiring two visits and (ii) requiring two visits, one of which was within dermatology or internal medicine. Results: The base case prevalence of PPP was estimated to be 147 per 100\u00c2\u00a0000 (women 227, men 68) and the annual prevalence was estimated to 26 per 100\u00c2\u00a0000 in 2015.

Purpose: Immunoglobulin (Ig) replacement therapy is an important life-saving treatment modality for patients with primary antibody immune deficiency disorders (PAD). IVIG and SCIg are suitable alternatives to treat patients with PAD but vary in key ways. Existing evidence on patient preferences for Ig treatments given the complexities associated with IVIG and SCIg treatment is limited and fails to account for variations in preferences across patients. For this reason, we sought to evaluate PAD patient preferences for features of IVIG and SCIg across different patient characteristics. Materials and Methods: 119 PAD patients completed a discrete-choice experiment (DCE) survey. The DCE asked respondents to make choices between carefully constructed treatment alternatives described in terms of generic treatment features. Choices from the DCE were analyzed to determine the relative influence of attribute changes on treatment preferences. We used subgroup analysis to evaluate systematic variations in preferences by patients\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 age, gender, time since diagnosis, and treatment experience. Results: Patients were primarily concerned about the duration of treatment side effects, but preferences were heterogeneous. This was particularly true around administration features.

The main study objective was to determine the prognosis of patients with GBM based on MGMT/pTERT classification, while the secondary objective was to estimate the temozolomide effect on the survival time of GBM with MGMT/pTERT classification. Methods A total of 50 GBM specimens were collected after tumor resection and were selected for investigating MGMT methylation and pTERT mutation. Clinical imaging and pathological characteristics were retrospectively analyzed. Patients with MGMT/pTERT classification were analyzed using survival analysis to develop the nomogram for forecasting and individual prognosis. Results All patients underwent resection (total resection: 28%, partial resection: 64%, biopsy: 8%). Thirty-two percent of all cases received adjuvant temozolomide with radiotherapy. Sixty-four percent of the case was found methylated MGMT, and 56% of the present cohort found pTERT mutation.

We analyzed the data from 163 patients older than 80 years admitted to our institution for COVID-19, during March and April 2020. A Lasso regression model and subsequent multivariate Cox regression were performed to select variables predictive of death. We evaluated the efficacy of immunomodulatory therapy in three cohorts using adjusted survival analysis. The mortality rate was 43%. The mean age was 85.2 years. The disease was considered severe in 76.1% of the cases. Lasso regression and multivariate Cox regression indicated that factors correlated with hospital mortality were: age (hazard ratio [HR] 1.12, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.03\u00e2\u20ac\u201c1.22), alcohol consumption (HR 3.15, 95% CI: 1.27\u00e2\u20ac\u201c7.84), CRP > 10 mg/dL (HR 2.67, 95% CI: 1.36\u00e2\u20ac\u201c5.24), and oxygen support with Venturi Mask (HR 6.37, 95% CI: 2.18\u00e2\u20ac\u201c18.62) or reservoir (HR 7.87, 95% CI: 3.37\u00e2\u20ac\u201c18.38). Previous treatment with antiplatelets was the only protective factor (HR 0.47, 95% CI: 0.23\u00e2\u20ac\u201c0.96). In the adjusted treatment efficacy analysis, we found benefit in the combined use of tocilizumab (TCZ) and corticosteroids (CS) (HR 0.09, 95% CI: 0.01\u00e2\u20ac\u201c0.74) compared to standard treatment, with no benefit of CS alone (HR 0.95, 95% CI: 0.53\u00e2\u20ac\u201c1.71).

Background: The aim of this study was to evaluate efficacy of various fertility-preservative treatments with progestin and analyze prognostic factors in Stage 1A of endometrial cancer. Materials and Methods: This retrospective study involved four Korean university hospitals. Data were collected from 43 women who were under the age of 40 with presumed stage IA endometrial cancer determined by magnetic resonance imaging and treated from January 2014 to December 2017. All of the patients were administered hormonal therapy for fertility preservation. Twenty-five patients received oral progestin with a levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine system (LNG-IUS) for 6-24 months, and 18 patients received high-dose oral progestin for the same period of time. Oncologic outcomes were evaluated. Prognostic factors for pathologic response to progestin were identified by logistic regression analysis. Results: Complete response (CR) was achieved by 72.1% of patients (31/43), and the average time to CR was 4.2 (Stable disease [SD] 3.4) months (range, 3-9 months). Partial response was achieved by 7.0% of patients (3/43), SD by 9.3% (4/43), and progressive disease by 11.6% (5/43). Of the CR patients, 41.9% (13/31) achieved pregnancy with the median follow-up period of 12.5 (SD 7.6) months (range: 3-50 months). No irreversible toxicity or therapy-associated death occurred.

Objective: To explore the role of protease nexin-1 (PN-1) in Alzheimer\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s disease (AD) via the sonic hedgehog (SHH) pathway. Methods: PN-1 lentiviral activation particles were injected into APP/PS1 transgenic AD and wild-type (WT) mice; these mice were subjected to the Morris water maze test, followed by ELISA, thioflavin S staining and NeuN-TUNEL dual staining. HT22 cells were induced with A\u00ce\u00b21\u00e2\u20ac\u201c42 and treated with PN-1 siRNA and/or cyclopamine (an SHH signaling inhibitor). The cells were then subjected to MTT and Annexin V-FITC/PI analyses. qRT-PCR and Western blotting were conducted to measure mRNA and protein expression. Results: The escape latency of the APP/PS1 transgenic AD mice was extended with a decreased number of platform crossings; in addition, increased A\u00ce\u00b2 deposits, A\u00ce\u00b21\u00e2\u20ac\u201c42 levels and hippocampal neuron apoptosis were observed in the brain tissues of AD mice.

Diabetic nephropathy (DN) is a chronic kidney disease that develops in patients with diabetes mellitus (DM). Renal dysfunction and persistent proteinuria are the main clinical features of DN. Podocyte injury is an important cause of persistent proteinuria and diabetic kidney disease (DKD) progression. Traditional Chinese patent medicines can improve renal function by enhancing autophagy and promoting apoptosis. Keluoxin is a Chinese patent medicine that has the effect of invigorating qi and nourishing yin, activating blood, and eliminating blood stasis. Therefore, we hypothesized that Keluoxin may have a protective effect against diabetic nephropathy in rats with type 2 DM. Rats induced with diabetes through streptozocin (STZ) injection and a high-fat and high-sugar diet were treated with Keluoxin (0.63 g/kg/day) for 8 weeks, and renal function, biochemical indicators, and histopathological changes in renal tissues were observed. Immunofluorescence staining and western blot analysis were used to detect the expression of autophagy-related proteins. The results showed that Keluoxin reduced blood glucose and lipid levels, improved renal function, and alleviated renal histopathological changes in rats with DN. The therapeutic effect was similar to that of Irbesartan (15.6 mg/kg/day). It is inferred that the mechanism works through reducing the obstruction of downstream pathways of autophagy by improving the lysosomal degradation function and alleviating podocyte injury. This study demonstrates that Keluoxin could regulate autophagy in podocytes, alleviate kidney injury in rats with DN, and have a protective effect on renal function; its mechanism can thus be a potential therapy for DN.\n",

Background/Aims: Sepsis is an uncontrolled systemic infection, withcomplex pathophysiology that may result in acute lung organ damage and cause multiple organ failure. Although much research has been conducted to illuminate sepsis\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s complex pathophysiology, sepsis treatment protocols are limited, and sepsis remains an important cause of mortality andmorbidity in intensive care units.Various studies have shown that idebenone (IDE) possesses strong antioxidant properties, which inhibit lipid peroxidation and protect cells from oxidative damage.

The animals were divided into a healthy control (no treatment), CLP, IDE control (200 mg/kg), and CLP + IDE subgroups (50 mg/kg, 100 mg/kg, and 200 mg/kg), with nine rats in each group.IDE was administered 1 h after CLP induction.To evaluate the protective effects of IDE, lung tissues were collected 16 h after sepsis for biochemical, immunohistochemical staining, and histopathological examination. Results: IDE significantly ameliorated sepsis-induced disturbances in oxidative stress-related factors, with its effects increasing in accordance with the dose.IDE also abolished histopathological changes in lung tissues associated with CLP.Furthermore, interleukin 1 beta (IL-1\u00ce\u00b2)and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-\u00ce\u00b1) immunopositivity markedly decreased in the septic rats following IDE treatment.

The cattle tick Rhipicephalus microplus affect animal health, welfare, and cattle production in tropical and subtropical zones of the world. Anti-tick vaccines have been an effective alternative for cattle tick control instead of traditional chemical products. To date, Subolesin antigen has shown efficacy for the control of tick infestation in cattle, and previous studies showed that one peptide derived from this protein has demonstrated to elicit a strong and specific humoral immune response. Based on these findings, herein we characterized the efficacy of the peptide Subolesin for the control of cattle tick, R. microplus infestation under field conditions. Twenty-four female calves were assigned to four experimental groups and immunized with three subcutaneous doses of the peptide Subolesin, Bm86, both antigens (dual vaccine) and adjuvant/saline alone, respectively. Serum antibody levels (IgG) were assessed by ELISA and confirmed by Western blot; also, reproductive performance of naturally infested R. microplus was determined. The results showed that immunizations with the experimental antigens reduced tick infestations with vaccine's efficacy of 67 % (peptide Subolesin), 56 % (Bm86), and 49 % (dual vaccine) based on adult tick numbers, oviposition, and egg fertility between vaccinated and control animals. Peptide Subolesin-immunized calves developed a strong humoral immune response expressed by high anti-pSubolesin IgG levels, and the Western blot analysis confirmed that it is immunogenic. Cattle receiving Bm86 and dual vaccine showed less protection, although Bm86 was within the range reported previously. The negative correlation between antibody levels and reduction of naturally infested R. microplus strongly suggested that the effect of the vaccine was the result of the antibody response in immunized cattle. In conclusion, it was demonstrated that the peptide Subolesin induced a specific immune response in cattle under field conditions, resulting in reduced R. microplus populations in subsequent generations.

Here, we show that quantitative proteome analysis of the sputum from severe patients with COVID-19 reveal high levels of neutrophil extracellular trap (NET) components, which was confirmed by microscopy. Extracellular DNA from excessive NET formation can increase sputum viscosity and lead to acute respiratory distress syndrome.

We treated five patients pwith COVID-19 resenting acute symptoms with clinically approved aerosolized Pulmozyme. No adverse reactions to the drug were seen, and improved oxygen saturation and recovery in all severely ill patients with COVID-19 was observed after therapy. Immunofluorescence and proteome analysis of sputum and blood plasma samples after treatment revealed a marked reduction of NETs and a set of statistically significant proteome changes that indicate reduction of hemorrhage, plasma leakage and inflammation in the airways, and reduced systemic inflammatory state in the blood plasma of patients.

Background Efforts to trace the rise of childhood vaccine safety concerns in the US often suggest Andrew Wakefield and colleagues' retracted 1998 Lancet study (AW98)-which alleged that the MMR vaccine can cause children to develop autism-as a primary cause of US vaccine skepticism. However, a lack of public opinion data on MMR safety collected before/after AW98's publication obscures whether anecdotal accounts are indicative of a potentially-causal effect. Methods We address this problem using a regression discontinuity framework to study change in monthly MMR injury claims (N = 74,850; from 1990-2019) from the Vaccine Adverse Events Reporting System (VAERS) to proxy concern about vaccine safety. Additionally, we suggest a potential mechanism for the effect of AW98 on vaccine skepticism, via automated sentiment analyses of MMR-related news stories (N = 674; from 1996-2000) in major television and newspaper outlets. Results AW98 led to an immediate increase of about 70 MMR injury claims cases per month, averaging across six estimation strategies (meta-analytic effect = 70.44 [52.19, 88.75], p < 0.01). Preliminary evidence suggests that the volume of negative media attention to MMR increased in the weeks following AW98's publication, across four estimation strategies (meta-analytic effect = 9.59% [3.66, 15.51], p < 0.01). Conclusions Vaccine skepticism increased following the publication of AW98, which was potentially made possible by increased negative media coverage of MMR. Significance Childhood vaccine skepticism presents an important challenge to widespread vaccine uptake, and undermines support for pro-vaccine health policies. In addition to advancing our understanding of the previously-obscured origins of US vaccine skepticism, our work cautions that high-profile media attention to inaccurate scientific studies can undermine public confidence in vaccines. We conclude by offering several recommendations that researchers and health communicators might consider to detect and address future threats to vaccine confidence.",

Introduction: Guidelines concerning intravenous iodinated contrast media (CM) during computed tomography (CT) examinations are important to follow to minimize the risk for post-contrast acute kidney injury (PC-AKI). The purpose of this study was to investigate the radiology departmental policy compliance with Swedish guidelines concerning PC-AKI. Methods: In February 2020, an electronic survey was distributed to the responsible radiographer at 41 radiology departments in all university hospitals and medium-sized hospitals in Sweden. The questions focused on routines around renal functional tests, individualized contrast administration and handling of patients with diabetes mellitus taking metformin. Results: The response rate was 83%. Seventy-six percent (n = 26) of radiology departments calculated estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) from serum creatinine prior to CM administration, but only 24% (n = 8) followed the recommendation to calculate eGFR from both serum creatinine and cystatin C. For acute/inpatients, 55% (n = 18) followed the recommendation that renal functional tests should be performed within 12 h before CM administration. For elective patients, 97% (n = 33) followed the recommendation to have eGFR newer than three months which is acceptable for patients with no history of disease that may have affected renal function. Approximately 80% of the radiology departments followed the recommendation that CM dose always should be individually adjusted to patient eGFR. Seventy-six percent (n = 26) followed the recommendation to continue with metformin at eGFR \u00e2\u2030\u00a5 45 ml/min. Conclusion: Compliance with the national guidelines was high regarding routines around renal functional tests, dose adjustment of CM and metformin discontinuation. Improvements can be made in using both cystatin C and serum creatinine for eGFR calculations as well as ensuring renal function tests within 12 h for acute/inpatients with acute disease that may affect renal function. Implications for practice: This study raises awareness of the importance of adhering to guidelines in healthcare. To have knowledge about the current level of compliance regarding PCI-AKI is important to maintain and develop effective clinical implementation of guidelines. The variation in practice seen in this study emphasizes the need of more effective implementation strategies to ensure adherence with best practice.",

Background: Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is a lethal disease, and multimodal strategies, such as surgery plus neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC)/adjuvant chemotherapy, have been attempted to improve survival in patients with localized PDAC. To date, there is one prospective study providing evidence for the superiority of a neoadjuvant strategy over upfront surgery for localized PDAC. However, which NAC regimen is optimal remains unclear. Methods: A randomized, exploratory trial is performed to examine the clinical benefits of two chemotherapy regimens, gemcitabine plus S-1 (GS) and gemcitabine plus nab-paclitaxel (GA), as NAC for patients with planned PDAC resection. Patients are enrolled after the diagnosis of resectable or borderline resectable PDAC. They are randomly assigned to either NAC regimen. Adjuvant chemotherapy after curative resection is highly recommended for 6 months in both arms. The primary endpoint is tumor progression-free survival time, and secondary endpoints include the rate of curative resection, the completion rate of protocol therapy, the recurrence type, the overall survival time, and safety. The target sample size is set as at least 100.

Since the advent of immune checkpoint inhibitors, rapid strides have been made in the realm of cancer immunotherapy. Of the abundance of infiltrating immune cells in the tumor microenvironment (TME), macrophages contribute a significant portion and make up to 50% of the tumor mass. In addition to this, the relative plasticity of macrophages makes it an attractive target to modulate macrophage functions to initiate an anti-tumor response. However, many challenges hinder this strategy. Macrophage colony-stimulating factor (MCSF) secreted by cancer cells binds to the colony-stimulating factor receptor present on macrophages and negatively influences macrophage functions. MCSF, along with a cocktail of immunosuppressive cytokines present in the TME, polarizes macrophages to an immunosuppressive pro-tumorigenic M2-like phenotype. M2-like macrophages dampen tumor response and are known to be associated with increased tumor progression and metastasis. Indeed, clinical interventions aimed to reprogram macrophage response from an M2-like tumor aiding phenotype to an M1-like tumor-killing phenotype using small-molecule inhibitors of the CSF1R axis have gathered much attention in the recent past. However, poor response and systemic toxicities observed in these therapies necessitate alternative therapeutic strategies. Furthermore, another key signaling pathway that has been recently implicated in aiding the CSF1R signaling in TAMs is the PDL1 signaling axis. Hence, in this study, we designed a self-assembled lipid nanoparticle system encompassing a potent small-molecule inhibitor of the CSF1R signaling axis, while the surface of the nanoparticle was tethered with anti-PDL1 mAb. The purpose of this is twofold; the nanoparticles can deliver the cargo in a targeted manner to PDL1 expressing M2-like macrophages while simultaneously blocking the receptor. The resulting nanoparticle system termed \u00ce\u00b1-PDL1-CSF-LNP showed enhanced repolarization of M2 like macrophages in vitro while also upregulating the phagocytic index. Furthermore, suboptimal dose administration of \u00ce\u00b1-PDL1-CSF-LNP in an aggressive melanoma mouse model resulted in superior anti-tumor efficacy with minimal toxicities. These results were validated by ex vivo mechanistic analysis showing that TAMs have successfully been repolarized to a predominantly M1-like phenotype. This, along with increased tumor infiltration of CD8+ T cells, worked in synergy to provide an effective anti-tumor strategy. Graphical abstract: [Figure not available: see fulltext.].",

In this study, the cytotoxic responses of six different over-the-counter mouthwashes on L929 cells were analyzed by two different techniques: the traditional colorimetric tetrazolium-based reduction assay (MTT) and the modern impedance-based real-time cell analysis (RTCA) system to investigate their biocompatibility in vitro. Thus, the investigation of the antiproliferative effects of the specified materials via different techniques is vital to reach this goal. Materials and Methods. First, L929 mouse fibroblasts were exposed to the dilutions of mouthwashes for 2 minutes. After incubation, the tetrazolium reduction method was used to assess the metabolic viability of cells measured by colorimetric MTT assay and morphological inspection of cells was performed via phase-contrast microscopy. Furthermore, the effect of each mouthwash on the proliferation, morphology, and adhesion of L929 cells was monitored continuously by a noninvasive and label-free RTCA system for 140 h. Results. Our data showed that all of the mouthwashes had varying cytotoxic effects on fibroblasts compared to the control group in MTT assay. In addition to that, RTCA technology has provided the growth kinetic profiles that can be used to analyze if the treatment is causing antimitotic or DNA-damaging effect on cells. Thus, analysis via this system can tell us the mechanism of toxicity behind the cell growth inhibition in vitro. Here, we found that only mouthwash 1 moderately maintained the viability of the L929 cells, yet displaying antimitotic effects and the other mouthwashes (mouthwash 2-mouthwash 6) showed toxicity via DNA-damaging effects. Conclusions. Of the six types of mouthwash tested, the most biocompatible result was obtained from a mouthwash containing alcohol (i.e., mouthwash 1).

Calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP), substance P and dural mast cells are main contributors in neurogenic inflammation underlying migraine pathophysiology. Modulation of endocannabinoid system attenuates migraine pain, but its mechanisms of action remain unclear. We investigated receptor mechanisms mediating anti-neuroinflammatory effects of endocannabinoid system modulation in in vivo migraine model and ex vivo hemiskull preparations in rats. To induce acute model of migraine, a single dose of nitroglycerin was intraperitoneally administered to male rats. Moreover, isolated ex vivo rat hemiskulls were prepared to study CGRP and substance P release from meningeal trigeminal afferents. We used methanandamide (cannabinoid agonist), rimonabant (cannabinoid receptor-1 CB1 antagonist), SR144528 (CB2 antagonist) and capsazepine (transient receptor potential vanilloid-1 TRPV1 antagonist) to explore effects of endocannabinoid system modulation on the neurogenic inflammation, and possible involvement of CB1, CB2 and TRPV1 receptors during endocannabinoid effects. Methanandamide attenuated nitroglycerin-induced CGRP increments in in vivo plasma, trigeminal ganglia and brainstem and also in ex vivo hemiskull preparations. Methanandamide also alleviated enhanced number and degranulation of dural mast cells induced by nitroglycerin. Rimonabant, but not capsazepine or SR144528, reversed the attenuating effects of methanandamide on CGRP release in both in vivo and ex vivo experiments. Additionally, SR144528, but not rimonabant or capsazepine, reversed the attenuating effects of methanandamide on dural mast cells. However, neither nitroglycerin nor methanandamide changed substance P levels in both in vivo and ex vivo experiments.

Methods: A prospective observational study was conducted at the Institute for Maternal and Child Health of Trieste, Italy, enrolling children undergoing procedural sedation with one of the following pharmacological regimens: propofol, propofol\u00c2\u00a0+ midazolam, ketamine\u00c2\u00a0+\u00c2\u00a0propofol, and dexmedetomidine\u00c2\u00a0+\u00c2\u00a0midazolam.

Background: There is a concern that glioma patients undergoing repeat craniotomies are more prone to complications. The study\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s goal was to assess if the complication profiles for initial and repeat craniotomies were similar, to determine predictors of complications, and to compare results with those in the literature. Methods: A retrospective study was conducted of glioma patients (WHO grade II\u00e2\u20ac\u201cIV) who underwent either an initial or repeat craniotomy performed by the senior author from 2012 until 2019. Complications were recorded by discharge, 30\u00c2\u00a0days, and 90\u00c2\u00a0days postoperatively. New neurologic deficits were recorded by 90\u00c2\u00a0days postoperatively. Multivariate regression was performed to identify factors associated with complications. A meta-analysis was performed to identify rates of complications based on number of prior craniotomies. Results: Within the cohort of 714 patients, 400 (56%) had no prior craniotomies, 218 (30.5%) had undergone 1 prior craniotomy, and 96 (13.5%) had undergone \u00e2\u2030\u00a5 2 prior craniotomies. There were 27 surgical and 10 medical complications in 30 patients (4.2%) and 19 reoperations for complications in 19 patients (2.7%) with no deaths by 90\u00c2\u00a0days. Complications, reoperation rates, and new neurologic deficits did not differ based on number of prior craniotomies. On multivariate analysis, older age (OR1.5, 95%CI 1.0\u00e2\u20ac\u201c2.2) and significant leukocytosis due to steroid use (OR12.6, 95%CI 2.5\u00e2\u20ac\u201c62.9) were predictors of complications.

Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is an incapacitating trauma-related disorder, with no reliable therapy. Although PTSD has been associated with epigenetic alterations in peripheral white blood cells, it is unknown where such changes occur in the brain, and whether they play a causal role in PTSD. Using an animal PTSD model, we show distinct DNA methylation profiles of PTSD susceptibility in the nucleus accumbens (NAc). Data analysis revealed overall hypomethylation of different genomic CG sites in susceptible animals. This was correlated with the reduction in expression levels of the DNA methyltransferase, DNMT3a. Since epigenetic changes in diseases involve different gene pathways, rather than single candidate genes, we next searched for pathways that may be involved in PTSD. Analysis of differentially methylated sites identified enrichment in the RAR activation and LXR/RXR activation pathways that regulate Retinoic Acid Receptor (RAR) Related Orphan Receptor A (RORA) activation. Intra-NAc injection of a lentiviral vector expressing either RORA or DNMT3a reversed PTSD-like behaviors while knockdown of RORA and DNMT3a increased PTSD-like behaviors. To translate our results into a potential pharmacological therapeutic strategy, we tested the effect of systemic treatment with the global methyl donor S-adenosyl methionine (SAM), for supplementing DNA methylation, or retinoic acid, for activating RORA downstream pathways. We found that combined treatment with the methyl donor SAM and retinoic acid reversed PTSD-like behaviors. Thus, our data point to a novel approach to the treatment of PTSD, which is potentially translatable to humans.",

Tolvaptan (TLV) was US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved for the indication to slow kidney function decline in adults at risk of rapidly progressing autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease in 2018. In vitro, TLV was a breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP) inhibitor, whereas the oxobutyric acid metabolite of TLV (DM-4013) was an inhibitor of organic anion transport polypeptide (OATP)1B1 and organic anion transporter (OAT)3. Based on the 2017 FDA guidance, potential for clinically relevant inhibition at these transporters was indicated for the highest TLV regimen. Consequently, two postmarketing clinical trials in healthy subjects were required. In trial 1, 5\u00c2\u00a0mg rosuvastatin calcium (BCRP and OATP1B1 substrate) was administered alone, with 90\u00c2\u00a0mg TLV or 48\u00c2\u00a0h following 7\u00c2\u00a0days of once daily 300\u00c2\u00a0mg TLV (i.e., in the presence of DM-4103). In trial 2, 40\u00c2\u00a0mg furosemide (OAT3 substrate) was administered alone and in presence of DM-4103. For BCRP, rosuvastatin geometric mean ratios (90% confidence intervals [CIs]) for maximum plasma concentration (Cmax) were 1.54 (90% CI 1.26\u00e2\u20ac\u201c1.88) and for area under the concentration-time curve from time 0 to the time of the last measurable concentration (AUCt) were 1.69 (90% CI 1.34\u00e2\u20ac\u201c2.14), indicating no clinically significant interaction.

Modestly removing the excessive reactive oxygen species (ROS) plays a crucial role in regulating the microenvironment of periodontitis and provides favorable conditions for osteogenesis. However, the current strategy for scavenging ROS is not controllable, substantially limiting the outcomes in periodontitis. Herein, we introduced a controllable ROS-scavenging nanoplatform by encasing N-acetylcysteine (NAC, (a well-known ROS scavenger) into tailor-made ROS-cleavable amphiphilic polymer nanoparticles (PEG-ss-PCL NPs) as an intracellular delivery carrier. The existing ROS in the inflammatory microenvironment facilitated polymer degradation via breakage of thioketal bonds, and then led to encapsulated NAC release. NAC eliminated all ROS induced by lipopolysaccharide (LPS), while PssL-NAC adjusted the ROS level slightly higher than that of the control group. The percentage of apoptotic cells cultured with NAC and PssL-NAC decreased observably compared with that of cells cultured with 10 \u00c2\u00b5g/ml LPS. The microenvironment regulated by PssL-NAC was highly suitable for osteogenic differentiation based on PCR and Western blot results, which showed higher expression levels of BMP2, Runx2, and PKA. Analysis of ALP activity and Alizarin red S staining showed consistent results. Additionally, the injection of PssL-NAC into the periodontitis area could alleviate the tissue destruction induced by ligation of the maxillary second molar. PssL-NAC showed a better ability to decrease osteoclast activity and inflammation, consequently improving the restoration of destroyed tissue. Our study suggests that ROS-responsive polymer nanoparticles loaded with NAC (PssL-NAC) can be new promising materials for the treatment of periodontitis. Statement of significance: More and more studies indicate that periodontal tissue damage is closely related to the high reactive oxygen species (ROS) environment. Excessive ROS will aggravate periodontal tissue damage and is not conducive to tissue repair. However, as an essential signal molecule in human physiological activities, ROS absence is also useless for tissue repair. In this study, we proposed to improve ROS imbalance in the environment of periodontitis as a strategy to promote periodontal regeneration and successfully synthesized a smart drug-releasing nanoplatform that can respond to ROS. Besides, we validated its ability to regulate the ROS environment and promote osteogenesis through experimental data in vivo and in vitro.",

The aim of this study was to evaluate in a case\u00e2\u20ac\u201ccontrol, cross-sectional study, the rate of renal complications and QoL in two sex- and age-matched cohort of patients with differentiated thyroid cancer with (n = 89) and without (n = 89) chronic post-operative HypoPT (PoHypoPT) and their relationship with the biochemical control of the disease. Methods: Serum and urinary parameters, renal ultrasound and QoL were assessed by SF-36 and WHO-5 questionnaires. Results: Forty-three (48.3%) PoHypoPT patients reported symptoms of hypocalcemia. Twenty-six (29.2%) patients were at target for all 6 parameters, 46 (51.6%) for 5. The most frequently unmet targets were gender-specific 24-h urinary calcium (44.9%) and serum calcium (37.1%).

Conversely, patients had a significant higher rate of renal calcifications and a lower SF-36, but not WHO-5, scores. SF-36 scores did not differ between PoHypoPT patients who were, or not, hypocalcemic. Conclusions: Our study shows that the rate of renal calcifications was higher in patients with PoHypoPT than in those without.

Methods: The activity of antibiotics against planktonic cells was assessed by performing MIC, MBC, and time-kill assays. The activity against mature biofilms was evaluated, in a microtiter plate, both in terms of dispersion (crystal violet assay) and residual viability (viable cell count). The effect of drug exposure on selected P. aeruginosa virulence genes expression was assessed by real-time Reverse Transcription quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR). Results: Apramycin MIC90 and MBC90 values were found at least fourfold lower than those for tobramycin. A comparable trend was observed for mucoid strains. Only 4 out of 24 strains (16.6%) showed an apramycin MIC higher than the epidemiological cut-off value of 64 mg/L, whereas a higher resistance rate was observed for tobramycin (62.5%; p < 0.01 vs. apramycin).

Introduction: Low-dose, weekly cisplatin (40 mg/m2) regimens are currently utilized at Eskenazi Health in Indianapolis, Indiana for the treatment of head and neck cancer due to enhanced tolerability. This retrospective analysis analyzes the incidence, severity, and risk factors for AKI in patients who received this regimen. Methods: A retrospective chart review was conducted including patients with head and neck cancer treated with weekly, low dose cisplatin (40 mg/m2) with concurrent radiotherapy (RT). From this criteria, 22 patients were identified and included in the final analysis. AKI was defined by the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 4.03. Results: Of the 22 patients included, 12 (54.5%) experienced AKI, with 10 patients (45.5%) experiencing grade 1 AKI and 2 patients (9.1%) experiencing grade 2 AKI. Six patients (27.3%) required dose adjustments or delays due to renal adverse events, all of which had initial cisplatin total weekly doses of >70 mg. Those receiving a total weekly cisplatin dose of >70 mg were found to have a higher risk of developing an episode of AKI compared to the group receiving <70 mg (p = 0.029). Conclusion: This analysis showed patients receiving weekly doses >70 mg of cisplatin as their initial treatment dose for head and neck cancer were more likely to experience AKI. There are inconsistencies in the frequency of AKI in our study compared to published literature; however, this comparison is difficult due to the small sample size of our trial. This demonstrates the need for further investigation into the issue.",

We developed a diblock copolymer, heparin-binding copolymer (HBC), that reverses intravenously administered heparins.

Inhibition of angiogenesis by specific antisera for vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 (VEGFR2), DC101, did not alter the loss of beta-cells and the fibrotic process in PDL-pancreas. However, DC101-mediated inhibition of angiogenesis abolished pancreatitis-induced beta-cell EMT and rendered it to apoptotic beta-cell death.

Synovial FLSs were isolated from RA patients and non-arthritic individuals (n=10 in both groups) and characterized; using immunocytochemistry and flow cytometry analysis. FLSs were divided into un-treated and Talabostat-treated groups to evaluate the FAP-\u00ce\u00b1 effect on the selected genes involved in cell cycle regulation (p21, p53, CCND1), apoptosis (Bcl-2, PUMA), and inflammatory and destructive behavior of FLSs (IL-6, TGF-\u00ce\u00b21, MMP-2, MMP-9, P2RX7).

Romosozumab monoclonal antibody treatment works by binding sclerostin and causing rapid stimulation of bone formation while decreasing bone resorption. The location and local magnitude of vertebral bone accrual by romosozumab and how it compares to teriparatide remains to be investigated. Here we analyzed the data from a study collecting lumbar computed tomography (CT) spine scans at enrollment and 12 months post-treatment with romosozumab (210 mg sc monthly, n\u00c2\u00a0=\u00c2\u00a017), open-label daily teriparatide (20 \u00ce\u00bcg sc, n\u00c2\u00a0=\u00c2\u00a019), or placebo (sc monthly, n\u00c2\u00a0=\u00c2\u00a020). For each of the 56 women, cortical thickness (Ct.Th), endocortical thickness (Ec.Th), cortical bone mineral density (Ct.bone mineral density (BMD)), cancellous BMD (Cn.BMD), and cortical mass surface density (CMSD) were measured across the first lumbar vertebral surface. In addition, color maps of the changes in the lumbar vertebrae structure were statistically analyzed and then visualized on the bone surface. At 12 months, romosozumab improved all parameters significantly over placebo and resulted in a mean vertebral Ct.Th increase of 10.3% versus 4.3% for teriparatide, an Ec.Th increase of 137.6% versus 47.5% for teriparatide, a Ct.BMD increase of 2.1% versus a \u00e2\u02c6\u20190.1% decrease for teriparatide, and a CMSD increase of 12.4% versus 3.8% for teriparatide. For all these measurements, the differences between romosozumab and teriparatide were statistically significant (p < 0.05). There was no significant difference between the romosozumab-associated Cn.BMD gains of 22.2% versus 18.1% for teriparatide, but both were significantly greater compared with the change in the placebo group (\u00e2\u02c6\u20194.6%, p < 0.05). Cortical maps showed the topographical locations of the increase in bone in fracture-prone areas of the vertebral shell, walls, and endplates.

However, a large proportion of patients cannot attain the target low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) levels, despite receiving maximally tolerated doses of high-intensity statins. Also, adherence to treatment may be reduced due to statin-induced myopathy or other side effects. For these reasons, guidelines recommend adding the cholesterol absorption inhibitor ezetimibe. Areas covered: Authors discuss the main pharmacological characteristics of rosuvastatin and ezetimibe, their lipid-lowering and pleiotropic effects, as well as the clinical effects of the fixed dose combination of these drugs when used to treat dyslipidemia. Expert opinion: The rosuvastatin/ezetimibe combination is safe and effective in patients with hypercholesterolemia or dyslipidemia with or without diabetes and with or without cardiovascular disease. This drug combination enabled higher proportions of patients to achieve recommended LDL-C goals than rosuvastatin monotherapy or the simvastatin/ezetimibe combination, without additional adverse events. Despite the lack of additional CV outcomes data and comparisons with atorvastatin/ezetimibe, rosuvastatin/ezetimibe appears as a potent and generally well-tolerated drug combination eligible for the management of hypercholesterolemia and dyslipidemia in adults.

Moreover, we functionally demonstrated that STAT6 hyperactivation contributes to therapy resistance by binding the glucocorticoid receptor, thus inhibiting its transcriptional activity. This was further confirmed by specific STAT6 gene silencing followed by dexamethasone treatment. Finally, JAK1/2-STAT6 pathway inhibition by ruxolitinib, an FDA approved drug, in cell line models and in one T-LBL primary sample led to cell proliferation reduction and increased apoptosis.

Background Vaccination against SARS-CoV-2 is a promising strategy to protect immunocompromised IBD patients from a severe course of COVID-19. As these patients were excluded from initial clinical vaccination trials, patients frequently express concerns regarding the safety of these vaccines, especially whether vaccination might trigger IBD flares (hit-and-run-hypothesis). Methods In order to assess the risk of an IBD flare after vaccination against SARS-CoV-2, an anonymous survey was performed at five German IBD centers and one patient organization (Deutsche Morbus Crohn/Colitis ulcerosa Vereinigung (DCCV) e.V.) in August and October 2021. Results The questionnaire was answered by 914 patients, 781 of whom reported a previous vaccination against SARS-CoV-2 (85.4%). Vaccination against SARS-CoV-2 was not associated with an increased risk of IBD flares (p=0.319) or unscheduled visits to the IBD physician (p=0.848). Furthermore, typical symptoms of an IBD flare including abdominal pain, increases in stool frequency, or rectal bleeding were not influenced by the vaccination. Conclusion Vaccination against SARS-CoV-2 is safe in IBD patients. These results may help to reduce fears regarding the vaccination in IBD patients.

Sirtuin 4 (SIRT4) is one of seven mammalian sirtuins that possesses ADP-ribosyltransferase, lipoamidase and deacylase activities and plays indispensable role in metabolic regulation. However, the role of SIRT4 in the retina is not clearly understood. The purpose of this study was to explore the location and function of SIRT4 in the retina. Therefore, immunofluorescence was used to analyze the localization of SIRT4 in rat, mouse and human retinas. Western blotting was used to assess SIRT4 and glutamine synthetase (GS) protein expression at different developmental stages in C57BL/6 mice retinas. We further analyzed the retinal structure, electrophysiological function and the expression of GS protein in SIRT4-deficient mice. Excitotoxicity was caused by intravitreal injection of glutamate (50 nmol) in mice with long-term intraperitoneal injection of resveratrol (20 mg/Kg), and then retinas were subjected to Western blotting and paraffin section staining to analyze the effect of SIRT4 on excitotoxicity. We show that SIRT4 co-locates with M\u00c3\u00bcller glial cell markers (GS and vimentin). The protein expression pattern of SIRT4 was similar to that of GS, and both increased with development. There were no significant retinal structure or electrophysiological function changes in 2-month SIRT4-deficient mice, while the expression of GS protein was decreased. Moreover, long-term administration of resveratrol can upregulate the expression of SIRT4 and GS while reducing the retinal injury caused by excessive glutamate. These results suggest that SIRT4 is highly expressed in retinal M\u00c3\u00bcller glial cells and is relevant to the expression of GS.

Background: Currently, no biomarkers of response to mitomycin C have been identified in non\u00e2\u20ac\u201cmuscle-invasive bladder cancer patients. Predictive biomarkers could improve the treatment outcome and eliminate adverse events from unnecessary treatment. Objective: To identify and validate predictive biomarkers of chemoresection with mitomycin C. Design, setting, and participants: The intervention group of a randomised controlled trial was identified for analyses. The study was conducted between January 2018 and June 2019 in two major urological departments in Denmark. Patients had a history of Ta low-grade/high-grade disease and were included upon recurrence. The intervention group (58 patients) received chemoresection with mitomycin C. Tumour and reference germline DNA from prior tumours were analysed by whole exome sequencing. Predictive biomarkers were validated in the context of Ta low-grade tumours from the UROMOL study. Outcome measurements and statistical analysis: Response to chemotherapy (intervention group from the randomised controlled trial) and recurrence-free survival (UROMOL cohort) were measured. Groups were compared using Fisher's exact test and Wilcoxon rank sum test. Results and limitations: Chemoresponse was associated with the mutation status of SPTAN1, APC, and FGFR3, and the level of APOBEC signature contribution (p = 0.035, p = 0.034, p = 0.055, and p = 0.035, respectively). The main limitations include no biopsy for biomarker discovery immediately prior to chemoresection and the unmatched validation cohort. Conclusions: Mutation status of APC, SPTAN1, and FGFR3 and the level of mutational contribution from APOBEC-related signatures were identified as potential predictive biomarkers for chemoresection with mitomycin C in non\u00e2\u20ac\u201cmuscle-invasive bladder cancer patients.

Importance: Limited data exist on the real-world safety outcomes of patients with neovascular age-related macular degeneration treated with brolucizumab (Beovu). Objective: To determine the real-world incidence of intraocular inflammation (IOI), including retinal vasculitis (RV) and/or retinal vascular occlusion (RO), for patients with neovascular age-related macular degeneration who underwent brolucizumab treatment. Additionally, potential risk factors associated with these adverse events were evaluated. Design, Setting, and Participants: This cohort study included patients with neovascular age-related macular degeneration in the Intelligent Research in Sight (IRIS) Registry and Komodo Healthcare Map. Patients initiating and receiving 1 or more brolucizumab injections from October 8, 2019, to June 5, 2020, with up to 6 months of follow-up were included. Intervention: Brolucizumab injections. Main Outcome and Measures: Incidence of IOI (including RV) and/or RO and RV and/or RO and risk stratification for the identified risk factors. Results: Of 10654 and 11161 included eyes (from the IRIS Registry and Komodo Health database, respectively), the median follow-up times were 97 and 95 days. Most eyes switched from another anti-vascular endothelial growth factor agent (9686 of 10654 [90.9%] and 10487 of 11161 [94.0%], respectively), most commonly aflibercept (7160 of 9686 [73.9%] and 7156 of 10487 [68.2%]), and most were from women (6105 of 10654 [57.3%] and 6452 of 11161 [57.8%]). The overall incidence of IOI and/or RO was 2.4% (255 of 10654 eyes) and 2.4% (268 of 11161 eyes) for the IRIS and Komodo groups, respectively, and RV and/or RO, 0.6% (59 of 10654 eyes and 63 of 11161 eyes), respectively. Patients with a history of IOI and/or RO in the 12 months before brolucizumab initiation had an increased observed risk rate (8.7% [95% CI, 6.0%-11.4%] and 10.6% [95% CI, 7.5%-13.7%]) for an IOI and/or RO event in the 6 months following the first brolucizumab treatment compared with patients without prior IOI and/or RO (2.0% in both data sets). There was an increased estimated incidence rate in women (2.9% [95% CI, 2.5%-3.3%] and 3.0% [95% CI, 2.6%-3.4%]) compared with men (1.3% [95% CI, 1.0%-1.7%] and 1.4% [95% CI, 1.0%-1.7%]), but this risk was not as large as that of a prior IOI and/or RO. Similar findings were observed for patients with RV and/or RO events. Conclusions and Relevance: The incidence rate of IOI and/or RO was approximately 2.4%. Patient eyes with IOI and/or RO in the 12 months prior to first brolucizumab injection had the highest observed risk rate for IOI and/or RO in the early months after the first brolucizumab treatment.

The pooled relative risk ratio (RR) of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE), its components, and gastrointestinal (GI) adverse events were computed using a random-effect model. Results: Ten RCTs comprising a total of 12,761 patients were identified. At a median follow-up of 12 months, there was a significantly lower risk of MACE [RR 0.66, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.45\u00e2\u20ac\u201c96], ACS (RR 0.66, 95% CI 0.45\u00e2\u20ac\u201c0.96), ischemic stroke (RR 0.42, 95% CI 0.22\u00e2\u20ac\u201c0.81), and need for revascularization (RR 0.61, 95% CI 0.42\u00e2\u20ac\u201c90) in patients receiving colchicine compared with placebo. A subgroup analysis based on the clinical presentation showed that the significantly lower incidence of MACE and stroke were driven by the patients presenting with ACS. The use of colchicine in patients with stable CAD did not reduce the incidence of MACE (RR 0.55, 95% CI 0.28\u00e2\u20ac\u201c1.09), ACS (RR 0.52, 95% CI 0.25\u00e2\u20ac\u201c1.08), or stroke (RR 0.61, 95% CI 0.33\u00e2\u20ac\u201c1.13).

Objective: To evaluate the safety and the synergistic effects of tea tree, lavender, eucalyptus and tangerine essential oils in combination on the skin using in vitro, ex vivo and clinical studies. Methods: The phototoxicity was predicted using 3T3 neutral red uptake phototoxicity test (OECD TG 432). Skin penetration was evaluated by confocal Raman microspectroscopy using direct application of essential oils to pig ears. For the clinical studies, 40 participants were enrolled and randomized in three groups: (1) lavender, eucalyptus and tangerine, (2) the same essential oils plus melaleuca and (3) placebo group. The skin was evaluated by noninvasive techniques before and after a 90-day period of topical use. Results: The essential oils were non-phototoxic, but the tangerine oil showed dose-dependent cytotoxicity (IC50: 33.1\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00b5g/ml), presenting 35% of penetration in the viable epidermis.

Safety monitoring concerns and the lack of a universal validated and approved primaquine pharmacovigilance tool is a challenge for a national rollout in many countries. This study aimed to explore the acceptance, reliability and perceived effectiveness of the primaquine roll out monitoring pharmacovigilance tool (PROMPT). Methods: This study was conducted in three dispensaries in the Coastal region of Eastern Tanzania. The study held six in-depth interviews with healthcare providers and six participatory focus group discussions with malaria patients (3) and parents/guardians of sick children (3).

Introduction Metformin is the initial oral antihyperglycemic agent (OHA) of choice for most patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D). However, more than one agent is often required for optimal glucose control. As the choice of preferred second OHAs is less well defined, we sought to compare the real-world safety of sulfonylureas to other OHAs as add-on therapy to metformin in patients with T2D. Research design and methods This retrospective cohort study included adults in Manitoba, Canada with T2D from 2006 to 2017. Using a new-user design, we divided patients who started on metformin into two groups: add-on therapy with a sulfonylurea and add-on therapy with a different OHA. Outcomes included all-cause mortality, cardiovascular events, and major hypoglycemic episodes. We calculated propensity scores and applied inverse probability of treatment weights to each individual. We compared groups using Cox proportional hazards regression and explored differences in HRs between pre-2008 (acarbose, meglitinides, and thiazolidinediones) and post-2008 (dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors, glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists, and sodium-glucose linked transporter-2 inhibitors) OHAs. Results Our cohort included 32 576 individuals (28 077 metformin plus sulfonylurea and 4499 metformin plus \u00e2\u201a\u00ac other'). Patients newly prescribed a sulfonylurea in the setting of metformin had a higher risk of all-cause mortality (HR 1.44, 95% CI 1.12 to 1.84, p=0.005) and major hypoglycemic episodes (HR 2.78, 95% CI 1.66 to 4.66, p<0.001) than those prescribed an \u00e2\u201a\u00ac other' OHA.

Background: Rapid assessment of COVID-19 vaccine safety during pregnancy is urgently needed. Methods: We conducted a rapid systematic review, to evaluate the safety of COVID-19 vaccines selected by the COVID-19 Vaccines Global Access-Maternal Immunization Working Group in August 2020, including their components and their technological platforms used in other vaccines for pregnant persons. We searched literature databases, COVID-19 vaccine pregnancy registries, and explored reference lists from the inception date to February 2021 without language restriction. Pairs of reviewers independently selected studies through COVIDENCE, and performed the data extraction and the risk of bias assessment. Discrepancies were resolved by consensus. Registered on PROSPERO (CRD42021234185). Results: We retrieved 6757 records and 12 COVID-19 pregnancy registries from the search strategy; 38 clinical and non-clinical studies (involving 2,398,855 pregnant persons and 56 pregnant animals) were included. Most studies (89%) were conducted in high-income countries and were cohort studies (57%). Most studies (76%) compared vaccine exposures with no exposure during the three trimesters of pregnancy. The most frequent exposure was to AS03 adjuvant, in the context of A/H1N1 pandemic influenza vaccines, (n = 24) and aluminum-based adjuvants (n = 11). Only one study reported exposure to messenger RNA in lipid nanoparticles COVID-19 vaccines. Except for one preliminary report about A/H1N1 influenza vaccination (adjuvant AS03), corrected by the authors in a more thorough analysis, all studies concluded that there were no safety concerns. Conclusion: This rapid review found no evidence of pregnancy-associated safety concerns of COVID-19 vaccines or of their components or platforms when used in other vaccines.

Background: Preapproval trials showed that messenger RNA (mRNA)-based vaccines against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) had a good safety profile, yet these trials were subject to size and patient-mix limitations. An evaluation of the safety of the BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine with respect to a broad range of potential adverse events is needed. Methods: We used data from the largest health care organization in Israel to evaluate the safety of the BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine. For each potential adverse event, in a population of persons with no previous diagnosis of that event, we individually matched vaccinated persons to unvaccinated persons according to sociodemographic and clinical variables. Risk ratios and risk differences at 42 days after vaccination were derived with the use of the Kaplan-Meier estimator. To place these results in context, we performed a similar analysis involving SARS-CoV-2-infected persons matched to uninfected persons. The same adverse events were studied in the vaccination and SARS-CoV-2 infection analyses. Results: In the vaccination analysis, the vaccinated and control groups each included a mean of 884,828 persons. Vaccination was most strongly associated with an elevated risk of myocarditis (risk ratio, 3.24; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.55 to 12.44; risk difference, 2.7 events per 100,000 persons; 95% CI, 1.0 to 4.6), lymphadenopathy (risk ratio, 2.43; 95% CI, 2.05 to 2.78; risk difference, 78.4 events per 100,000 persons; 95% CI, 64.1 to 89.3), appendicitis (risk ratio, 1.40; 95% CI, 1.02 to 2.01; risk difference, 5.0 events per 100,000 persons; 95% CI, 0.3 to 9.9), and herpes zoster infection (risk ratio, 1.43; 95% CI, 1.20 to 1.73; risk difference, 15.8 events per 100,000 persons; 95% CI, 8.2 to 24.2).

Amyloid \u00ce\u00b2-protein (A\u00ce\u00b2) is reported to activate NLRP3 inflammasomes and drive pyroptosis, which is subsequently involved in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease (AD). To date, the pathogenesis of AD is unfortunately insufficiently elucidated. Therefore, this study was conducted to explore whether Salidroside (Sal) treatment could benefit AD by improving pyroptosis. Firstly, two animal models of AD, induced, respectively, by A\u00ce\u00b21-42 and D-galactose (D-gal)/AlCl3, have been created to assist our appreciation of AD pathophysiology. We then confirmed that pyroptosis is related to the pathogenesis of AD, and Sal can slow the progression of AD by inhibiting pyroptosis. Subsequently, we established the D-gal and Nigericin-induced PC12 cells injury model in vitro to verify Sal blocks pyroptosis mainly by targeting the NLRP3 inflammasome. For in vivo studies, we observed that A\u00ce\u00b2 accumulation, Tau hyperphosphorylation, neurons of hippocampal damage, and cognitive dysfunction in AD mice, caused by bilateral injection of A\u00ce\u00b21-42 into the hippocampus and treatments with D-gal combine AlCl3. Besides, accumulated A\u00ce\u00b2 promotes NLRP3 inflammasome activation, which leads to the activation and release of a pro-inflammatory cytokine, interleukin-1 beta (IL-1\u00ce\u00b2). Notably, both A\u00ce\u00b2 accumulation and hyperphosphorylation of Tau decreased and inhibited pyroptosis by downregulating the expression of IL-1\u00ce\u00b2 and IL-18, which can be attributed to the treatment of Sal. We further found that Sal can reverse the increased protein expression of TLR4, MyD88, NF-\u00ce\u00baB, P-NF-\u00ce\u00baB, NLRP3, ASC, cleaved Caspase-1, cleaved GSDMD, IL-1\u00ce\u00b2, and IL-18 in vitro. The underlying mechanism may be through inhibiting TLR4/NF-\u00ce\u00baB/NLRP3/Caspase-1 signaling pathway. Our study highlights the importance of NLRP3 inflammasome-mediated pyroptosis in AD, and how the administration of pharmacological doses of Sal can inhibit NLRP3 inflammasome-mediated pyroptosis and ameliorate AD. Thus, we conclude that NLRP3 inflammasome-mediated pyroptosis plays a significant role in AD and Sal could be a therapeutic drug for AD.",

Mast cells contribute to the pathogenesis of allergic and nonallergic inflammatory diseases. Salvinorin A has been previously shown to inhibit leukotriene production and mast cell degranulation to suppress airway hyperresponsiveness caused by sensitization; thus, we hypothesized that salvinorin A has an anti-AR effect.

Introduction: Satisfaction with medications prescribed for osteoarthritis (OA) varies; this study aimed to determine the factors associated with satisfaction in US patients and their physicians. Methods: This point-in-time study used the Adelphi OA Disease Specific Programme (physicians identified from public lists reported on nine consecutive patients diagnosed with OA [any joint]: physicians and patients completed questionnaires). Patient\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s demographic, clinical, and treatment characteristics associated with patient-reported and physician-rated overall satisfaction with, and expectations of effectiveness of, medication for OA were assessed using multivariate linear regression.

Pain intensity was moderate or severe for 59.4% of patients. Greater patient-reported overall satisfaction with medication was significantly associated with (standardized beta, 95% confidence interval) exercise (0.12, 0.03\u00e2\u20ac\u201c0.20), comorbid other musculoskeletal or painful conditions (vs none) (0.15, 0.06\u00e2\u20ac\u201c0.24), and physicians\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 report that the best control had been achieved (0.12, 0.03\u00e2\u20ac\u201c0.20); lack of efficacy was among factors associated with worse satisfaction.

Objective: Increasing hair fullness is a global unmet need for many men and women. An approach to the problem is to decrease hair fall or shedding by reducing scalp stratum corneum oxidation and barrier damage to increase hair retention. This study evaluated a combination of functional antioxidants and barrier-enhancing cosmetic ingredients to improve scalp condition thereby enabling stronger hair anchorage and longer retention. Methods: Male and female subjects with normal scalp condition and self-perceived hair thinning participated in a 24-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized clinical study assessing either a regimen of treatment shampoo and leave-on treatment containing functional antioxidant and barrier-enhancing agents or an identical placebo chassis shampoo control. The functional ingredients were piroctone olamine, zinc pyrithione, zinc carbonate, niacinamide, panthenol and caffeine. At baseline and after 8, 16 and 24\u00c2\u00a0weeks of product use, several measurements were taken: hair shedding, total hair count (by phototrichogram), hair samples, TEWL and evaluation of biomarkers of scalp and hair conditions. Subjects also completed self-assessment questionnaires. Results: Statistically significant effects for functional ingredient-containing treatment regimen versus a placebo control shampoo formulation were observed for reduced hair shedding, increased total hair count, reduced TEWL and improvement in scalp biomarker values. Subjects also noticed these improvements assessed via self-assessment questionnaires. Conclusions: These results establish that the use of functional antioxidant and barrier-enhancing agents to further improve scalp condition can enable a reduction in hair shedding and thus an increase in perceived hair fullness.

Bovine anaplasmosis caused by Anaplasma marginale is a disease responsible for serious animal health problems and great economic losses all over the world. Thereby, the identification of A. marginale isolates from various bioclimatic areas in each country, the phylogeographic analysis of these isolates based on the most informative markers, and the evaluation of the most promising candidate antigens are crucial steps in developing effective vaccines against a wide range of A. marginale strains. In order to contribute to this challenge, a total of 791 bovine samples from various bioclimatic areas of Tunisia were tested for the occurrence of A. marginale DNA through msp4 gene fragment amplification. Phylogeographic analysis was performed by using lipA and sucB gene analyses, and the genetic relationship with previously characterized A. marginale isolates and strains was analyzed by applying similarity comparison and phylogenetic analysis. To evaluate the conservation of OmpA protein vaccine candidate, almost complete ompA nucleotide sequences were also obtained from Tunisian isolates, and various bioinformatics software were used in order to analyze the physicochemical properties and the secondary and tertiary structures of their deduced proteins and to predict their immunodominant epitopes of B and T cells. A. marginale DNA was detected in 19 bovine samples (2.4%). Risk factor analysis shows that cattle derived from subhumid bioclimatic area were more infected than those that originated from other areas. The analysis of lipA phylogeographic marker indicated a higher diversity of Tunisian A. marginale isolates compared with other available worldwide isolates and strains. Molecular, phylogenetic, and immuno-informatics analyses of the vaccine candidate OmpA protein demonstrated that this antigen and its predicted immunodominant epitopes of B and T cells appear to be highly conserved between Tunisian isolates and compared with isolates from other countries, suggesting that the minimal intraspecific modifications will not affect the potential cross-protective capacity of humoral and cell-mediated immune responses against multiple A. marginale worldwide strains.",

An escalating pandemic caused by the novel severe acute respiratory syndrome corona-virus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has severely impacted global health.

In this study, we used a pseudotype virus (pv) containing the SARS-CoV-2 S glycoprotein to screen a botanical drug library containing 1037 botanical drugs to identify agents that prevent SARS-CoV-2 entry into the cell. Our study identified four hits, including angeloylgomisin O, schisandrin B, procyanidin, and oleanonic acid, as effective SARS-CoV-2 S pv entry inhibitors in the micromolar range. A mechanistic study revealed that these four agents inhibited SARS-CoV-2 S pv entry by blocking spike (S) protein-mediated membrane fusion. Furthermore, angeloylgomisin O and schisandrin B inhibited authentic SARS-CoV-2 with a high selective index (SI; 50% cytotoxic concentration/50% inhibition concentration). Our drug combination studies performed in cellular antiviral assays revealed that angeloylgomisin O has synergistic effects in combination with remdesivir, a drug widely used to treat SARS-CoV-2-mediated infections.

Cisplatin acts by interfering with DNA repair mechanisms to cause DNA damage and apoptosis. It has indications in many malignancies including bladder, head and neck and lung cancers. Acute kidney injury is a well-known complication of cisplatin. Case report: We report a 42-year-old male with a long history of Xeroderma pigmentosum treated with adjuvant cisplatin (40\u00e2\u20ac\u2026mg/m2) in combination with radiotherapy for cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma of the neck.

Importance: The Delta variant is now the predominant circulating SARS-CoV-2 strain worldwide. Severity of illness in persons infected with the SARS-CoV-2 Delta variant compared with the Beta variant is not known. Objective: To directly compare clinical outcomes in persons infected with the SARS-CoV-2 Delta variant vs those infected with the Beta variant in Qatar. Design, Setting, and Participants: This retrospective cohort study used data from the national COVID-19 database in Qatar, which includes information on all individuals who were ever tested for SARS-CoV-2 using a reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction test and all individuals who received any SARS-CoV-2 vaccine in Qatar. Among persons with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection between March 22 and July 7, 2021, those infected with the Delta variant were identified and were propensity score matched with control individuals infected with the Beta variant. The variants were ascertained by variant genotyping of the positive samples. Exposures: SARS-CoV-2 infection with the Delta or Beta variant. Main Outcomes and Measures: The main outcomes were admission to the hospital, admission to the intensive care unit, use of supplemental oxygen, use of high-flow oxygen, receipt of mechanical ventilation, or death among those infected with the Delta or Beta variant overall and stratified by vaccination status. Results: Among 1427 persons infected with the Delta variant (252 [55.9%] male; median age, 34 years [IQR, 17-43 years]) and 5353 persons infected with the Beta variant (233 [51.7%] male; median age, 34 years [IQR, 17-45 years]), 451 propensity score-matched pairs were identified. Persons infected with the Delta variant were more likely to be hospitalized (27.3% [95% CI, 23.2%-31.6%] vs 20.0% [95% CI, 16.4-24.0]; P =.01) or to have mild-moderate or severe-critical disease outcomes (27.9% [95% CI, 23.8%-32.3%] vs 20.2% [95% CI, 16.6%-24.2%]; P =.01) compared with persons infected with the Beta variant. Infection with the Delta variant was independently associated with higher odds of experiencing any adverse outcome (adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 2.53; 95% CI, 1.72-3.72).

The long-term neurobehavioral consequences of prenatal SSRI exposure require further evaluation. This study examined the effects of prenatal fluoxetine exposure in mice in an extensive battery of behaviors related to neurodevelopment, mood, social, and repetitive behaviors. C57BL/6J dams were administered fluoxetine at a low (0.6 mg/kg/day) or high (6 mg/kg/day) dose or saline from embryonic days 8 to 18. Juvenile mice were tested for changes in ultrasonic vocalizations and neuromotor development. In adulthood, offspring were tested for changes in behaviors related to anxiety, depression, social, and repetitive behaviors. Prenatal exposure to fluoxetine impaired surface righting reflex at P5, and sex-dependently reduced the frequency of ultrasonic vocalizations in juvenile males but not females. In adulthood, both males and females prenatally exposed to high, but not low, doses of fluoxetine exhibited an increase in repetitive behaviors in the marble burying task and a decrease in sucrose preference. Males, but not females, exposed to fluoxetine exhibited increased anxiety-related behaviors in the elevated plus maze. Prenatal fluoxetine exposure did not affect other adult behaviors including social preference, self-grooming, passive avoidance and open field activity.

Background: Rheumatoid arthritis is a progressive and systemic autoimmune disease seriously compromises human health. Fibroblast like synoviocytes are the major effectors of proliferation and inflammation in rheumatoid arthritis synovial tissue. Shikonin has anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory activities. But, its role on synovitis of rheumatoid arthritis is unknown. Methods: The DBA/1 male mice were randomly divided into the following three groups (n = 6): (1) the normal control group of mice, (2) the CIA (collagen-induced arthritis) group in which mice suffered from arthritis induced by collagen, (3) the SKN (shikonin) group of mice which got arthritis and given intragastrically with shikonin 4\u00c2\u00a0mg/kg per day continuously for 20\u00c2\u00a0days,(4) the MTX (methotrexate) group of mice which got arthritis and orally administration with shikonin 0.5 mg/kg once two days continuously for 20 days. The therapeutic effect of shikonin on collagen induced arthritis mice was tested by arthritis incidence rate, arthritis score and inflammatory joint histopathology. The invasion, adhesion and migration of fibroblast like synoviocytes induced by tumor necrosis factor-\u00ce\u00b1 were applied to measure the anti-synovitis role of shikonin. The effect of shikonin on expression of interleukin-6, interleukin-1\u00ce\u00b2 and tumor necrosis factor-\u00ce\u00b1 was measured by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay. The interaction between shikonin and suppressor of cytokine signaling 1 was verified by molecular docking. The signaling pathways activated by shikonin were measured by western blot. Results: Shikonin decreased the arthritis score and arthritis incidence, and inhibited inflammation of inflamed joints in collagen induced arthritis mice. And shikonin reduced the number of vimentin+cells in collagen induced arthritis mice inflamed joints. Meanwhile, shikonin suppressed tumor necrosis factor-\u00ce\u00b1-induced invasion, adhesion and migration of fibroblast like synoviocytes and reduced the expression of interleukin-6, interleukin-1\u00ce\u00b2 and tumor necrosis factor-\u00ce\u00b1.

Fenofibrate (FN) is a hypolipemic drug used for the treatment of mixed dyslipidemia. Since in our previous study FN administration to young and old rats adversely affected the serum activity of liver marker enzymes, we decided to examine the effects of FN on liver ultrastructure of young and old animals. Material and methods. Young and old rats were fed standard rodent chow supplemented with 0.1% FN for 30 days. Liver samples obtained from animals under full anesthesia were processed by routine methods to obtain ultrathin and histological sections for the examination by light microscopy (LM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Furthermore, liver lysates were analyzed by Western blotting for the expression of the autophagy-related proteins LC3A/B and beclin 1. Results. The ultrastructure of hepatocytes in both age groups was well-preserved, with the presence of abundant mitochondria, numerous peroxisomes and lysosomes, glycogen stored in the form of rosettes, and occasionally autolysosomes. However, hepatocytes of old control rats contained less mitochondria and peroxisomes, and more lipid droplets than cells of young animals. The effects of FN on liver ultrastructure were age-depended. FN increased the relative number of mitochondria and peroxisomes in the hepatocytes of old, and did not af-fect their number in young rats. Moreover, FN decreased and increased the relative number of lipid droplets in the hepatocytes of old and young rats, respectively. At the LM level, Oil Red O staining revealed smaller and larger lipid droplets within hepatocytes and non-parenchymal liver cells. In the livers of young and old rats lipid droplets were distributed mainly in the periportal zones of hepatic lobules. Morphometric analysis confirmed that livers of control old rats contained more lipid-stainable areas than those of young ones; however, no effect of FN was observed either in young or old rats. Despite larger size of autolysosomes and autophagic vacuoles in hepatocytes of old rats, the expression of autophagy-related proteins did not differ in the livers of control and fenofibrate-treated young and old animals. Conclusions. The results of our study suggest that fenofibrate, apart from its hypolipemic action, may have ben-eficial effect on the energy metabolism in the liver of old individuals by increasing the number of mitochondria and peroxisomes in hepatocytes.",

Introduction: Nivolumab is a human immunoglobulin G4 monoclonal antibody that inhibits programmed cell death-1 activity by binding to the programmed cell death-1 receptors. Cancer cells express increased number of programmed cell death-1 ligands and this allows them to escape the cytotoxic effects of the T cells. Therefore, the negative programmed cell death-1 receptor signal regulates T-cell proliferation and activation is disrupted. However, this change in the activity of the T cells can cause them to lose their ability to recognize host cells. The immune response enabled by these agents has led to side effects, commonly known as \u00e2\u20ac\u0153immune-related adverse events.\u00e2\u20ac\u009d Case report: We report a case of a 66-year-old male patient who was treated with nivolumab for recurrent renal cell carcinoma presented with hepatitis and adrenalitis. Three weeks after starting nivolumab, the patient had abdominal pain and weakness, and then aspartate and alanine transaminase levels were found to be elevated. Management and outcome: Hepatitis was predicted to be due to nivolumab, because other causes were excluded. He started using oral methylprednisolone and then, hepatitis improved. However, while receiving methylprednisolone treatment, fludrocortisone was started with the pre-diagnosis of adrenalitis due to the persistence of fatigue, weakness, and hyponatremia and hyperkalemia. With both treatments, the patient's symptoms and sodium and potassium level returned to normal.

These responses are suppressed by dietary supplementation with the \u00cf\u2030-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid docosahexaenoic acid (DHA). Here, we tested the hypothesis that dietary DHA supplementation suppresses cSiO2-induced inflammatory proteins in bronchoalveolar alveolar lavage fluid (BALF) and plasma of lupus-prone mice. Archived tissue fluid samples were used from a prior investigation in which 6 wk-old lupus-prone female NZBWF1 mice were fed isocaloric diets containing 0 or 10 g/kg DHA for 2 wks and then intranasally instilled with 1 mg cSiO2 or vehicle once weekly\u00c2\u00a0for 4\u00c2\u00a0wks. Cohorts were terminated at 1, 5, 9 or 13 wk post-instillation (PI). BALF and plasma from each cohort were analyzed by high density multiplex array profiling of 200 inflammatory proteins. cSiO2 time-dependently induced increases in the BALF protein signatures that were highly reflective of unresolved lung inflammation, although responses in the plasma were much less robust. Induced proteins in BALF included\u00c2\u00a0chemokines (e.g., MIP-2, MCP-5), enzymes (e.g., MMP-10, granzyme B), adhesion molecules (e.g., sE-selectin, sVCAM-1), co-stimulatory molecules (e.g., sCD40L, sCD48), TNF superfamily proteins (e.g., sTNFRI, sBAFF-R), growth factors (e.g., IGF-1, IGFBP-3), and signal transduction proteins (e.g., MFG-E8, FcgRIIB), many of which were blocked or delayed by DHA supplementation.

Introduction: Immunotherapy has been recognized as the standard of care in addition to chemotherapy in the treatment of advanced non-small cell lung cancer. Most immunotherapy trials, however, exclude patients with autoimmune disease owing to concerns of disease exacerbation. Case report: We report a case of a patient with advanced non-small cell lung cancer and underlying active psoriasis who experienced a remarkable response, without developing psoriasis flares, following treatment with a single dose of atezolizumab and first-line chemotherapy. Management and outcome: The patient remained asymptomatic 10 months since treatment discontinuation, without disease progression, despite having received only a single dose of atezolizumab and six cycles of chemotherapy. Discussion: Little is known about the optimum duration required to achieve a durable response with immunotherapy. Patients with autoimmune disease are commonly excluded from immunotherapy trials owing to a higher risk of autoimmune disease flares or immune-related adverse events. The remarkable outcome observed in this case offers some insights into the possible durable response with limited doses of immunotherapy and a safer approach for administering immunotherapy in patients with autoimmune disease. Initiating chemotherapy to induce remission in active autoimmune disease prior to administering immunotherapy could potentially be an ideal approach that facilitates the use of immunotherapy in this patient population.",

Introduction: Tumor lysis syndrome (TLS) is a commonly observed oncological emergency that requires prompt diagnosis and treatment. Rasburicase is a recombinant urate oxidase endorsed in TLS for the treatment of hyperuricemia. The effect of single-dose 7.5 mg rasburicase at longer follow-ups was not widely investigated. Patients and Methods: Eighty-two patients included in the study with clinical TLS and laboratory TLS. The primary endpoint was the normalization of uric acid (<6mg/dL) within 24 hours of rasburicase administration, which was described as treatment success. The secondary endpoint was defined as having sustained response at the first week. The third endpoint was defined as the reaching the baseline renal function before TLS. Results: We found that the use of a 7.5 mg dose of rasburicase controlled uric acid in 74 of 82 (90,2%) patients at the 24th hour. In the first week, uric acid remained at normal levels in 69 of 82 (84,1%) patients. At 24 hours, the TLS risk group was the only predictor for failing uric acid normalization; at the end of the first week, no predictive factor was identified for failing uric acid normalization.

Methods: We consecutively enrolled inpatients and outpatients of a teaching hospital in Sydney, Australia, with penicillin allergy labels requiring penicillin for first-line treatment. Patients were classified as \u00e2\u20ac\u0153low-risk\u00e2\u20ac\u009d or \u00e2\u20ac\u0153non\u00e2\u20ac\u201clow-risk\u00e2\u20ac\u009d based on the allergy labels. All patients proceeded directly to amoxicillin DPT, unless there was a history of anaphylaxis within 10 years of assessment to a beta-lactam (except for cefazolin) or Gell and Coombs type 2, type 3, or severe type 4 reaction. This was followed by a course of amoxicillin. Results: A total of 149 patients (41 inpatients, 108 outpatients) were enrolled. No patient was excluded from the study. No patient experienced life-threatening reactions to the protocol. There were 85 patients who reported \u00e2\u20ac\u0153non\u00e2\u20ac\u201clow-risk\u00e2\u20ac\u009d allergy labels. One patient developed generalized pruritus and rash that resolved with standard-dose antihistamines, 2 developed delayed benign maculopapular exanthem, and 3 experienced diarrhea during the course of amoxicillin.

Background: Sitagliptin, a dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitor licensed for the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), has been reported to improve psoriasis. Objective: We compared the effects of sitagliptin treatment, a DPP-4 inhibitor, in combination with narrow-band ultraviolet-B (NB-UVB) phototherapy compared to NB-UVB alone on psoriasis severity, quality of life, cardiovascular disease risk factors and immune parameters in people with moderate psoriasis without T2DM. Methods: In this 39-week, single-centre, randomised controlled trial, people were allocated randomly to receive sitagliptin for 24 weeks with NB-UVB or NB-UVB alone.

The median (IQR) baseline PASI was 8.8 (7.5-11.6). At 24 weeks, the mean difference from baseline in PASI (-1.0 [95% CI-2.0 to 0.0]) was significantly larger in the sitagliptin/NB-UVB arm than in the NB-UVB-alone arm (p = 0.044).

Blood and skin eosinophils count and dermal fibrosis between AD and PSO patients were compared, and immunohistochemistry for periostin and mRNA sequencing in the dermis were performed. Animal experiments using AD and PSO murine model were conducted. Big data analysis revealed that patients with AD have significantly lesser degree of SD than patients with PSO. The ratio of the dermal fibrous tissues and eosinophil counts were significantly higher in AD patients. In AD skin, periostin was more widely distributed in the entire dermis and POSTN mRNAs were significantly upregulated. Dermal thickness and fibrosis were significantly higher in AD mice even after TGC treatment. A significant positive correlation was observed between dermal fibrosis and tissue eosinophil counts.

Background: Our previous works demonstrated that \u00ce\u00b22-microglobulin (\u00ce\u00b22m), a systemic pro-aging factor, induce depressive-like behaviors. Hydrogen sulfide (H2S) is identified as a potential target for treatment of depression. The aim of the present work is to explore whether H2S antagonizes \u00ce\u00b22m-induced depressive-like behaviors and the underlying mechanisms. Methods: The depressive-like behaviors were detected using the novelty suppressed feeding test (NSFT), tail suspension test (TST), forced swimming test (FST) and open field test (OFT). The expressions of Warburg-related proteins, including hexokinase II (HK II), pyruvate kinase M2 (PKM2), Lactate dehydrogenase A (LDHA), pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) and pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 1(PDK1), and synaptic plasticity-related proteins, including postsynaptic density protein 95 (PSD95) and synaptophysin1 (SYN1), were determined by western blotting. Result: we found that NaHS (the donor of H2S) attenuated the depressive-like behaviors in the \u00ce\u00b22m-exposed rats, as judged by NSFT, TST, FST, and OFT. We also demonstrated that NaHS enhanced the synaptic plasticity, as evidenced by the upregulations of PSD95 and SYN1 expressions in the hippocampus of \u00ce\u00b22m-exposed rats. Furthermore, NaHS improved the Warburg effect in the hippocampus of \u00ce\u00b22m-exposed rats, as evidenced by the upregulations of HK II, PKM2, LDHA and PDK1 expressions, and the downregulation of PDH expression.

We determined sPD-L1 levels before and during nivolumab treatment in two prospective clinical trials of metastatic clear cell renal cell carcinoma (RCC) and melanoma patients, and investigated its relationship to clinical factors, biomarkers, and outcome. Methods Using a new Single Molecule Array assay, serum sPD-L1 level were determined in RCC (CheckMate 009, n=91) and melanoma (CheckMate 038-Part 1, n=78) prior to, and at two time points on treatment. Gene expression data was obtained from biopsies taken prior to, and at day 28 on treatment. Results were integrated with clinical variables, tumor PD-L1 status from immuno-histochemistry, and genomic mutation status. Results In RCC patients, sPD-L1 levels were higher in patients with progressive disease as their best response. For both RCC and melanoma patients, progressive or stable disease was associated with an increase in sPD-L1 on nivolumab therapy, whereas mean sPD-L1 levels did not change or declined in patients with objective responses. By categorizing RCC patients into transcriptomic molecular subtypes, we identified a subgroup where the associations between sPD-L1 and progressive disease were particularly evident. In baseline biopsies, we identified six biological processes that were associated with sPD-L1 level in both RCC and melanoma: higher sPD-L1 is associated with lower tumor expression of the Hallmark gene sets 'hypoxia', 'fatty acid metabolism', 'glycolysis', 'MTORC1 signaling' and 'androgen response', and with higher expression of 'KRAS signaling-Down'. Conclusion Baseline and on-therapy sPD-L1 levels in RCC have the potential to predict progressive disease on PD-1 inhibitor nivolumab. In a hypothesis-generating analysis of tumor gene expression, high baseline sPD-L1 is associated with a tumor metabolic state reflecting potentially targetable processes in both melanoma and RCC. In both trials, we observed associations between change in sPD-L1 on treatment and outcome metrics. sPD-L1 levels may further refine a nivolumab-refractory subtype of RCC within transcriptionally based subtypes of RCC.\n",

Heterozygous deletion of Scn1a in mice (Scn1a+/\u00e2\u02c6\u2019) recapitulates several core phenotypes, including temperature-dependent and spontaneous seizures, SUDEP, and behavioral abnormalities. Furthermore, Scn1a+/\u00e2\u02c6\u2019 mice exhibit a similar clinical response to standard anticonvulsants.

The difference between the high-dose and the placebo groups was \u00e2\u02c6\u20190.91\u00c2\u00a0mmHg (95% confidence intervals: \u00e2\u02c6\u20191.73, \u00e2\u02c6\u20190.09). 0.5% sovesudil TID met the criteria for superiority to the placebo. The most frequent ocular adverse event among sovesudil-treated patients was conjunctival hyperaemia (24.4% for the high-dose and 17.5% for the low-dose group) and predominately classified as mild. Conclusions: Sovesudil 0.25% and 0.5% TID showed statistically significant IOP-lowering effects and 0.5% concentration\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s IOP-lowering effects met the superiority criteria in comparison with the placebo at week 4. Sovesudil was well tolerated with mild adverse events including relatively low incidence of conjunctival hyperaemia in patients with NTG.",

            "premise": "Speech Characteristics of Patients with Parkinson's Disease-Does Dopaminergic Medications Have a Role?. Objective The present study aimed to investigate the effects of dopaminergic medication on voice, speech motor functions, and motor impairment in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD). Materials and Methods Twenty-five individuals (16 males and 9 females) with PD underwent comprehensive assessment of voice, speech, and motor functions in levodopa medication ON and medication OFF conditions. Age- and gender-matched healthy controls were recruited to compare speech and acoustic parameters. Multi-Dimensional Voice Program (MDVP) from Computerized Speech Laboratory (Model: 4500) was utilized for acoustic analysis of voice and the Voice Handicap Index (VHI) for the self-assessment of vocal function. Frenchay Dysarthria Assessment (FDA-2) and Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale-III (UPDRS III) were used to evaluate speech motor and motor functions, respectively. Statistical Analysis The mean and standard deviation were used as descriptive statistics measures. Raw scores were obtained for FDA-2, DRS, VHI, MDVP parameters, and UPDRS-III in either medication condition. The Wilcoxon signed-rank test was performed to determine the statistical significance of the above measures in both genders across the medication conditions. Spearman's rank correlation coefficient was used to determine the relationship between motor speech function and motor impairment and between VHI and MDVP parameters across both medication conditions. The interrater reliability rating was established using Cohen's kappa. Results An improvement in lip and laryngeal functioning was found in the medication ON over medication OFF state in both males and females with PD. A few frequency and amplitude-related measures improved in the medication-ON state over the medication-OFF state. UPDRS-III scores reduced from the OFF state to the ON state, and no change in dysarthria severity or VHI was found in either gender or medication condition. No correlation was found between speech motor function and motor function or between VHI and acoustic parameters of voice in either medication condition. Conclusions Improvement in motor symptoms with levodopa was predominantly observed when compared with the minor improvements in a few aspects of speech motor function and vocal parameters. The results of this study suggest the need for speech therapy as a nonpharmacological treatment method for speech impairments in PD.",
