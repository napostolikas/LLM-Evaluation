Question: Given [Infantile Spasms and Trisomy 21: Unfavorable Outcomes with First-line Vigabatrin Therapy. Introduction: Among children with infantile spasms (ISs), those with trisomy 21 (T21) and those with normal development at onset and no identifiable etiology (previously referred to as idiopathic) are expected to have relatively favorable outcomes. The study objective is to determine if differences exist in treatment response, relapse, and subsequent epilepsy between these two groups when vigabatrin is used as first-line treatment. Methods: In this retrospective study, patients were classified into the following groups and clinical features were compared: T21 (n = 24) and IS with normal development at onset and no identified etiology (n = 40; control group). Results: There was no significant difference in the age of IS onset, sex distribution, or treatment lag between the groups. The T21 compared to the control group required a higher mean number of anti-seizure therapies (3.6 vs. 1.9, p < 0.001), had more relapses [10 (42%) vs. 4 (10%), p < 0.005)], and had higher risk of subsequent epilepsy [11 (46%) vs. 8 (20%), p < 0.003]. Relapses were often delayed in the T21 group, with a mean of 8 months after IS cessation. Conclusion: Our results differ from most studies using steroids as first-line treatment where the groups were shown to have similar treatment response and T21 patients had a low risk of relapse and subsequent epilepsy. Therefore, our results suggest that vigabatrin as first-line treatment in T21 with IS may be less favorable than steroids.

Question: Given [11C-radiolabeled aptamer for imaging of tumors and metastases using positron emission tomography- computed tomography. Identification of primary tumors and metastasis sites is an essential step in cancer diagnostics and the following treatment. Positron emission tomography-computed tomography (PET/CT) is one of the most reliable methods for scanning the whole organism for malignancies. In this work, we synthesized an 11C-labeled oligonucleotide primer and hybridized it to an anti-cancer DNA aptamer. The 11C-aptamer was applied for in vivo imaging of Ehrlich ascites carcinoma and its metastases in mice using PET/CT. The imaging experiments with the 11C-aptamer determined very small primary and secondary tumors of 3 mm2 and less. We also compared 11C imaging with the standard radiotracer, 2-deoxy-2-[fluorine-18]fluoro-D-glucose (18F-FDG), and found better selectivity of the 11C-aptamer to metastatic lesions in the metabolically active organs than 18F-FDG. 11C radionuclide with an ultra-short (20.38 min) half-life is considered safest for PET/CT imaging and does not cause false-positive results in heart imaging. Its combination with aptamers gives us high-specificity and high-contrast imaging of cancer cells and can be applied for PET/CT-guided drug delivery in cancer therapies.] you can assume that [11C-radiolabeled aptamer is better than 18F-FDG for imaging tumors and metastases using positron emission tomography-computed tomography.].

Question: Given [Ligand-Induced Stabilization of the Native Human Superoxide Dismutase 1. A common characteristic of familial (fALS) and sporadic amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (sALS) is the accumulation of aberrant proteinaceous species in the motor neurons and spinal cord of ALS patients - including aggregates of the human superoxide dismutase 1 (hSOD1). hSOD1 is an enzyme that occurs as a stable dimeric protein with several post-translational modifications such as the formation of an intramolecular disulfide bond and the acquisition of metal cofactors that are essential for enzyme activity and further contribute to protein stability. Some mutations and/or destabilizing factors promote hSOD1 misfolding, causing neuronal death. Aggregates containing misfolded wild-type hSOD1 have been found in the spinal cords of sALS as well as in non-hSOD1 fALS patients, leading to the hypothesis that hSOD1 misfolding is a common part of the ALS pathomechanism. Therefore, stabilizing the native conformation of SOD1 may be a promising approach to prevent the formation of toxic hSOD1 species and thus ALS pathogenesis. Here, we present the 16-mer peptide S1VL-21 that interferes with hSOD1 aggregation. S1VL-21 was identified by phage display selection with the native conformation of hSOD1 as a target. Several methods such as microscale thermophoresis (MST) measurements, aggregation assays, and cell viability assays revealed that S1VL-21 has a micromolar binding affinity to native hSOD1 and considerably reduces the formation of hSOD1 aggregates. This present work therefore provides the first important data on a potential lead compound for hSOD1-related drug development for ALS therapy.

Question: Given [A 7-year-old boy and a 14-year-old girl initially diagnosed with toxic shock syndrome and tested positive for sars-cov-2 infection, supporting a diagnosis of multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (Mis-c). Background: Multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) has recently been described in children infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). This report describes 2 children with MIS-C who were initially diagnosed with toxic shock syndrome but who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection on reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction, supporting the diagnosis of MIS-C. Case Reports: Case 1. A 7-year-old boy with fever, cough, and dyspnea was treated with oxygen, intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) infusion, and methylprednisolone and showed a worsening of clinical conditions, persistent fever, hypotension, and hematological parameters compatible with macrophage activation syndrome (MAS). Three intravenous boluses of methylprednisolone (30 mg/kg/day) were followed by a progressive resolution. Case 2. A 14-year-old girl with syncope, fever, diarrhea, oliguria, and increased creatinine levels required fluid infusion and correction of electrolyte imbalance. The increase of creatine phosphokinase (CPK), myoglobin, troponin, and creatine kinase-MB (CK-MB) was associated with grade I atrioventricular block and pericardial effusion. The patient showed myositis and severe muscular weakness, with hematological parameters compatible with MIS-C. She started IVIG and 3 intravenous boluses of methylprednisolone. However, bradycardia, tachypnea, severe hypotension, loss of consciousness, oliguria, bilateral ground-glass pneumonia, bilateral pleural, and peritoneal effusion, in the absence of thromboembolism, required treatment with furosemide, albumin, and enoxaparin, and was followed by a prompt resolution. Conclusions: These 2 pediatric cases highlight the importance of SARS-CoV-2 testing in all patients with acute symptoms and signs of infection during the COVID-19 pandemic. As new variants of SARS-CoV-2 emerge, cases of MIS-C can become more prevalent, and pediatricians should be aware of diagnostic and management guidelines.] you can assume that [Enoxaparin can be used to treat thromboembolism.].

He presented to our hospital with a complaint of severe dyspnea. On the evaluation of dyspnea, the patient was diagnosed with ILD. Management and outcome: After exclusion of other common causes of pneumomediastinum and subcutaneous emphysema, panitumumab was attributed as a cause of ILD.

Question: Given [A Cell Cycle Progression-Derived Gene Signature to Predict Prognosis and Therapeutic Response in Hepatocellular Carcinoma. Objective. Dysregulation of cell cycle progression (CCP) is one of the hallmarks of cancer. Here, our study is aimed at developing a CCP-derived gene signature for predicting high-risk population of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Methods. Our study retrospectively analyzed the transcriptome profiling and clinical information of HCC patients from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and International Cancer Genome Consortium (ICGC) projects. Uni- and multivariate cox regression models were conducted for identifying which hallmarks of cancer were risk factors of HCC. CCP-derived gene signature was developed with LASSO method. The predictive efficacy was verified by ROC curves and subgroup analyses. A nomogram was then generated and validated by ROC, calibration, and decisive curves. Immune cell infiltration was estimated with ssGSEA method. Potential small molecular compounds were predicted via CTRP and CMap analyses. The response to chemotherapeutic agents was evaluated based on the GDSC project. Results. Among hallmarks of cancer, CCP was identified as a dominant risk factor for HCC prognosis. CCP-derived gene signature displayed the favorable predictive efficacy in HCC prognosis independent of other clinicopathological parameters. A nomogram was generated for optimizing risk stratification and quantifying risk evaluation. CCP-derived signature was in relation to immune cell infiltration, HLA, and immune checkpoint expression. Combining CTRP and CMap analyses, fluvastatin was identified as a promising therapeutic agent against HCC. Furthermore, CCP-derived signature might be applied for predicting the response to doxorubicin and gemcitabine. Conclusion. Collectively, CCP-derived gene signature was a promising marker in prediction of survival outcomes and therapeutic responses for HCC patients.

The response to chemotherapeutic agents was evaluated based on the GDSC project. Results. Among hallmarks of cancer, CCP was identified as a dominant risk factor for HCC prognosis. CCP-derived gene signature displayed the favorable predictive efficacy in HCC prognosis independent of other clinicopathological parameters. A nomogram was generated for optimizing risk stratification and quantifying risk evaluation. CCP-derived signature was in relation to immune cell infiltration, HLA, and immune checkpoint expression. Combining CTRP and CMap analyses, fluvastatin was identified as a promising therapeutic agent against HCC. Furthermore, CCP-derived signature might be applied for predicting the response to doxorubicin and gemcitabine. Conclusion. Collectively, CCP-derived gene signature was a promising marker in prediction of survival outcomes and therapeutic responses for HCC patients.

Question: Given [Disulfiram-loaded lactoferrin nanoparticles for treating inflammatory diseases. Sepsis is a dysregulated immune response to infection and potentially leads to life-threatening organ dysfunction, which is often seen in serious Covid-19 patients. Disulfiram (DSF), an old drug that has been used to treat alcohol addiction for decades, has recently been identified as a potent inhibitor of the gasdermin D (GSDMD)-induced pore formation that causes pyroptosis and inflammatory cytokine release. Therefore, DSF represents a promising therapeutic for the treatment of inflammatory disorders. Lactoferrin (LF) is a multifunctional glycoprotein with potent antibacterial and anti-inflammatory activities that acts by neutralizing circulating endotoxins and activating cellular responses. In addition, LF has been well exploited as a drug nanocarrier and targeting ligands. In this study, we developed a DSF-LF nanoparticulate system (DSF-LF NP) for combining the immunosuppressive activities of both DSF and LF. DSF-LF NPs could effectively block pyroptosis and inflammatory cytokine release from macrophages. Treatment with DSF-LF NPs showed remarkable therapeutic effects on lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced sepsis. In addition, this therapeutic strategy was also applied to treat ulcerative colitis (UC), and substantial treatment efficacy was achieved in a murine colitis model. The underlying mode of action of these DSF-LF-NPs may contribute to efficiently suppressing macrophage-mediated inflammatory responses and ameliorating the complications caused by sepsis and UC. As macrophage pyroptosis plays a pivotal role in inflammation, this safe and effective biomimetic nanomedicine may offer a versatile therapeutic strategy for treating various inflammatory diseases by repurposing DSF.

Aims and Objectives: To compare the efficacy and safety of newer antidepressants like Escitalopram and Desvenlafaxine versus conventional antidepressant like Imipramine in patients with Depressive episode. Material and Methods: An open label, prospective, comparative study was conducted in the Department of Pharmacology, Sri Krishna Medical College (SKMC), Muzaffarpur, Bihar associated with psychiatry outpatient department (OPD), Sri Krishna Medical College and Hospital (SKMCH), Muzaffarpur, Bihar during last 3 months. Results: 72 newly diagnosed patients of depressive episode according to ICD-10 criteria were divided into three groups of 24 each receiving Imipramine (Group A), Escitalopram (Group B) and Desvenlafaxine (Group C) and followed up for 6 weeks. Efficacy measurement was reduction in MADRS, CGI-S and CGI-I scores. Safety assessment was by number, severity and dropouts due to adverse drug reactions and laboratory investigations. Data was analyzed using ANOVA and Chi square test. Response rate was 51% in Group B, 43% in Group A and 40% in Group C, but this difference was not statistically significant. Initial response was seen as early as 2 weeks in 51% in group B and 40% in group C but none in group A and showed statistical significance.

Question: Given [Pevonedistat Suppresses Pancreatic Cancer Growth via Inactivation of the Neddylation Pathway. Background: The neddylation pathway is aberrantly overactivated in multiple human cancers and has been indicated as an effective target for anticancer therapy in clinical trials. We aimed to study whether the neddylation pathway is upregulated in pancreatic cancer and whether pevonedistat, a first-in-class anticancer agent specifically targeting this pathway, will suppress cancer tumorigenesis and progression. Methods: We evaluated the expression pattern of neddylation pathway components in 179 pancreatic adenocarcinoma (PAAD) compared with 171 normal tissues from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) dataset and further assessed PAAD patient prognosis with high neddylation pathway expression via Gene Expression Profiling Interactive Analysis (GEPIA). We then analyzed malignant cancer phenotypes both in vitro and in vivo, as well as intrinsic molecular mechanisms upon pevonedistat treatment. Results: We found that the neddylation pathway was hyperactivated in pancreatic cancer. Patients with high neddylation pathway expression exhibited worse prognoses. Pevonedistat significantly inhibited the cancer cell cycle, cell growth, and proliferation; increased cell apoptosis; and decreased cancer cell xenografts in a mouse model. Mechanistically, pevonedistat treatment and the siRNA knockdown neddylation pathway were able to remarkably induce the accumulation of Wee1, p27, and p21. Further mechanistic studies revealed that pevonedistat mainly impaired the ubiquitination level and delayed the protein degradation of Wee1, p27, and p21. Conclusions: Our results showed that pevonedistat targeted the overexpression of the neddylation pathway in pancreatic cancer to induce cell growth suppression by inducing the accumulation of the cell cycle regulators Wee1, p27, and p21, which provides sound evidence for the clinical trial of pevonedistat for pancreatic cancer therapy.] you can assume that [Pevonedistat is an effective and safe option for pancreatic cancer therapy.].

The purpose of this prospective double-blinded positive control study was to compare the efficacy of 2.5% polyacrylamide hydrogel (2.5% PAAG) in the management of middle carpal joint lameness in Thoroughbreds against treatments of triamcinolone acetonide (TA) or sodium hyaluronate (HA). A total of 31 flat-racing Thoroughbreds with lameness (grade 1-3/5) localized to the carpus by intra-articular analgesia were selected. Following a radiological assessment of the carpi confirming the absence of fragment/fracture, the horses were randomly assigned for intra-articular treatment with either 2 ml of 2.5% PAAG, 12 mg TA or 20 mg HA (followed by two further intravenous treatments of 40 mg, at weekly intervals in the HA group only), by a treating veterinarian. All horses were rested for 48 hours post-treatment and then re-entered an unaltered training regimen. Subsequent examinations at 2, 4, and 6 weeks were performed by a blinded examining veterinarian for all groups, while horses treated with 2.5% PAAG were monitored for 12 weeks for recurrence of lameness.

Question: Given [A Global Study on the Correlates of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and COVID-19 Vaccine Distribution. This study aimed to explore the association between the GDP of various countries and the progress of COVID-19 vaccinations; to explore how the global pattern holds in the continents, and investigate the spatial distribution pattern of COVID-19 vaccination progress for all countries. We have used consolidated data on COVID-19 vaccination and GDP from Our World in Data, an open-access data source. Data analysis and visualization were performed in R-Studio. There was a strong linear association between per capita income and the proportion of people vaccinated in countries with populations of one million or more. GDP per capita accounts for a 50% variation in the vaccination rate across the nations. Our assessments revealed that the global pattern holds in every continent. Rich European and North-American countries are most protected against COVID-19. Less developed African countries barely initiated a vaccination program. There is a significant disparity among Asian countries. The security of wealthier nations (vaccinated their citizens) cannot be guaranteed unless adequate vaccination covers the less affluent countries. Therefore, the global community should undertake initiatives to speed up the COVID-19 vaccination program in all countries of the world, irrespective of their wealth.] you can imply that [COVID-19 vaccine distribution depends on per capita income and gross domestic product.].

Question: Given [Isotretinoin Associated Rhabdomyolysis: Monitoring Creatine Kinase and Educating Patients. Monitoring specific values at baseline and throughout treatment is standard of care for isotretinoin therapy; however, creatine kinase (CK) blood monitoring is often excluded. Herein, we describe the importance of CK monitoring during isotretinoin therapy to assess the risk of rhabdomyolysis and potential renal damage, regardless of muscle-related symptom presentation. We present 2 patients with hyperCKemia: a 16-year-old male on isotretinoin whose CK levels were elevated (7,325 U/L) when rhabdomyolysis symptoms were present, and an asymptomatic 18-year-old male with elevated CK levels (35,000 U/L) before starting isotretinoin.

Question: Given [A Honeycomb-Like Bismuth/Manganese Oxide Nanoparticle with Mutual Reinforcement of Internal and External Response for Triple-Negative Breast Cancer Targeted Therapy. Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) exhibits aggressive behavior and high levels of metastasis owing to its complex heterogeneous structure and lack of specific receptors.

The extra-high drug load Bi@Bi2O3@MnOx NPs (honey-comb like structure) are formed by Kirkendall effect and electrostatic attraction. After modified with CM, they can home into tumor sites precisely, where they respond to internal overexpressed glutathione (GSH), releasing Mn2+ for chemodynamic therapy (CDT) with GSH depletion, while H2O2 degrades into O2 enabling relief of tumor hypoxia. In response to external near-infrared irradiation, mBMNI NPs intelligently generate vigorous heat and single oxygen (1O2) for photothermal therapy (PTT) and photodynamic therapy (PDT) owing to high load.

Question: Given [Erratum: Static magnetic fields dampen focused ultrasound-mediated blood-brain barrier opening (Radiology (2021) DOI: 10.1148/radiol.2021204441). Background: Focused ultrasound combined with microbubbles has been used in clinical studies for blood-brain barrier (BBB) opening in conjunction with MRI. However, the impact of the static magnetic field generated by an MRI scanner on the BBB opening outcome has not been evaluated. Purpose: To determine the relationship of the static magnetic field of an MRI scanner on focused ultrasound combined with microbubble- induced BBB opening. Materials and Methods: Thirty wild-type mice were divided into four groups. Mice from different groups were sonicated with focused ultrasound in different static magnetic fields (approximately 0, 1.5, 3.0, and 4.7 T), with all other experimental parameters kept the same. Focused ultrasound sonication was performed after intravenous injection of microbubbles. Microbubble cavitation activity, the fundamental physical mechanism underlying focused ultrasound BBB opening, was monitored with passive cavitation detection. After sonication, contrast-enhanced T1-weighted MRI was performed to assess BBB opening outcome. Intravenously injected Evans blue was used as a model agent to evaluate trans-BBB delivery efficiency. Results: The microbubble cavitation dose decreased by an average of 2.1 dB at 1.5 T (P = .05), 2.9 dB at 3.0 T (P = .01), and 3.0 dB at 4.7 T (P = .01) compared with that outside the magnetic field (approximately 0 T). The static magnetic field of an MRI scanner decreased BBB opening volume in mice by 3.2-fold at 1.5 T (P <001), 4.5-fold at 3.0 T (P <.001), and 11.6-fold at 4.7 T (P <.001) compared with mice treated outside the magnetic field.

Question: Given [A Multimetric Evaluation of Online Patient Educational Materials for Breast Implant-associated Anaplastic Large Cell Lymphoma. Objective: To assess understandability, actionability, and readability of online patient educational materials (OPEM) related to breast implant-associated anaplastic large cell lymphoma (BIA-ALCL). Methods: Search volumes for query terms related to BIA-ALCL including "breast implant associated lymphoma,""breast implant associated anaplastic large cell lymphoma,"and "BIA-ALCL"were analyzed in one-week increments and normalized to total Google search volume. The same terms were then queried using an online search engine to identify commonly accessed OPEM on this topic. Understandability and actionability of OPEM were evaluated using the Patient Education Materials Assessment Tool. Grade-level readability was determined using generalized estimating equations, with observations nested within readability metrics from each website. All interval estimates were calculated for 95% confidence. Results: Overall, 24 websites were identified based on search parameters. Of these websites, 11 (45.8%) met criteria for understandability, and 1 (4.2%) met criteria for actionability. Overall, readability ranged from 10.2 to 17.3 for all websites with an average grade level readability of 12.4; 0 websites were written at or below a sixth-grade reading level. Government websites had the highest average grade reading level at 14.0, followed by commercial websites at 13.2, nonprofit websites at 12.0, and then academic/hospital-based websites at 11.5. Conclusion: The quality of available OPEM on BIA-ALCL is limited. Future development of OPEM should be designed with the goal of improving both comprehension and actionability to help reduce patient anxiety and unnecessary clinical appointments related to this disease.

Question: Given [A Transvenous Endovascular Approach in Straight Sinus Has Minor Impacts on Chordae Willisii. Cerebral dural sinuses contain different types of chordae willisii (CW). The transvenous endovascular approach, which has become an optimal method for the treatment of cerebrovascular diseases, such as malformation, fistula, and chronic intracranial hypertension, due to sinus thromboses, frequently uses retrograde navigation through dural sinuses. Whether or how much the endoscopic procedure damages the chordae willisii is often not well-assessed. In our study, an overall number of 38 cadaveric heads were analyzed for the distribution and features of the chordae willisii in the straight sinus. We used an endoscope on these samples mimicking a mechanical thrombectomy procedure performed in the straight sinus. Both endoscopic gross observation and light microscopic histological examination were used to assess the damages to the chordae willisii by the procedure. We found that the valve-like lamellae and longitudinal lamellae structures were mainly found in the posterior part of straight sinus whereas trabeculae were present in both anterior and posterior portions. We treated a group of samples with a stent and another with a balloon. The stent-treated group had a significantly higher rate of Grade 1 damage comparing with the balloon-treated group (p = 0.02). The incidence of damage to the surface of chordae willisii was also higher in the stent-treated group (p = 0.00). Neither the use of stent nor of balloon increased the rate of damage to chordae willisii during repeated experiments. These findings indicated that stent or balloon navigation through the straight sinus can cause minor damages to the chordae willisii and frequent uses of retrograde navigation through the straight sinus do not appear to increase the rates of damage to chordae willisii.] you can imply that [A mechanical thrombectomy procedure can damage the cerebral dural sinuses.].

Question: Given [Iduronate-2-sulfatase transport vehicle rescues behavioral and skeletal phenotypes in a mouse model of Hunter syndrome. Mucopolysaccharidosis type II (MPS II) is a lysosomal storage disorder caused by deficiency of the iduronate-2-sulfatase (IDS) enzyme, resulting in cellular accumulation of glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) throughout the body. Treatment of MPS II remains a considerable challenge as current enzyme replacement therapies do not adequately control many aspects of the disease, including skeletal and neurological manifestations. We developed an IDS transport vehicle (ETV:IDS) that is engineered to bind to the transferrin receptor; this design facilitates receptor-mediated transcytosis of IDS across the blood-brain barrier and improves its distribution into the brain while maintaining distribution to peripheral tissues. Here we show that chronic systemic administration of ETV:IDS in a mouse model of MPS II reduced levels of peripheral and central nervous system GAGs, microgliosis, and neurofilament light chain, a biomarker of neuronal injury. Additionally, ETV:IDS rescued auricular and skeletal abnormalities when introduced in adult MPS II mice. These effects were accompanied by improvements in several neurobehavioral domains, including motor skills, sensorimotor gating, and learning and memory.

Question: Given [Repurposing the Veterinary Antibiotic Apramycin for Antibacterial and Antibiofilm Activity Against Pseudomonas aeruginosa From Cystic Fibrosis Patients. Objectives: To evaluate the in vitro antibacterial, antibiofilm, and antivirulence activities of apramycin, comparatively to tobramycin, against a set of P. aeruginosa from chronically infected cystic fibrosis (CF) patients. Methods: The activity of antibiotics against planktonic cells was assessed by performing MIC, MBC, and time-kill assays. The activity against mature biofilms was evaluated, in a microtiter plate, both in terms of dispersion (crystal violet assay) and residual viability (viable cell count). The effect of drug exposure on selected P. aeruginosa virulence genes expression was assessed by real-time Reverse Transcription quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR). Results: Apramycin MIC90 and MBC90 values were found at least fourfold lower than those for tobramycin. A comparable trend was observed for mucoid strains. Only 4 out of 24 strains (16.6%) showed an apramycin MIC higher than the epidemiological cut-off value of 64 mg/L, whereas a higher resistance rate was observed for tobramycin (62.5%; p < 0.01 vs. apramycin). In time-kill analyses, both aminoglycosides were found bactericidal, although apramycin showed a more rapid effect and did not allow for regrowth. Apramycin generally stimulated biofilm biomass formation, whereas tobramycin showed opposite trends depending on the strain tested. Both drugs caused a highly significant, dose-dependent reduction of biofilm viability, regardless of strain and concentration tested. The exposure to apramycin and tobramycin caused increased expression of mexA and mexC (multidrug efflux pumps), whereas tobramycin specifically increased the expression of aprA (alkaline protease) and toxA (exotoxin A).

(ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT03356561) Setting: United States. Participants: 100 healthy adult volunteers. Intervention: Ad26.ZIKV.001, an adenovirus serotype 26 vector encoding ZIKV M-Env, administered in 1- or 2-dose regimens of 5_1010 or 1_1011 viral particles (vp), or placebo. Measurements: Local and systemic adverse events; neutralization titers by microneutralization assay (MN50) and T-cell responses by interferon-g enzyme-linked immunospot and intracellular cytokine staining; and protectivity of vaccineinduced antibodies in a subset of participants through transfer in an exploratory mouse ZIKV challenge model. Results: All regimens were well tolerated, with no safety concerns identified. In both 2-dose regimens, ZIKV neutralizing titers peaked 14 days after the second vaccination, with geometric mean MN50 titers (GMTs) of 1065.6 (95% CI, 494.9 to 2294.5) for 5_1010 vp and 956.6 (595.8 to 1535.8) for 1_1011 vp.

Question: Given [Cost impact analysis of novel host-response diagnostic for patients with community-acquired pneumonia in the emergency department. Background: There is significant over-prescription of antibiotics for suspected community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) patients as bacterial and viral pathogens are difficult to differentiate. To address this issue, a host response diagnostic called MeMed BV (MMBV) was developed that accurately differentiates bacterial from viral infection at the point of need by integrating measurements of multiple biomarkers. A literature-based cost-impact model was developed that compared the cost impact and clinical benefits between using the standard of care diagnostics combined with MMBV relative to standard of care diagnostics alone. Methods: The patient population was stratified according to the pneumonia severity index, and cost savings were considered from payer and provider perspectives. Four scenarios were considered. The main analysis considers the cost impact of differences in antibiotic stewardship and resulting adverse events. The first, second, and third scenarios combine the impacts on antibiotic stewardship with changes in hospital admission probability, length of hospital stay and diagnosis related group (DRG) reallocation, and hospital admission probability, length of stay, and DRG reallocation in combination, respectively. Results: The main analysis results show overall per-patient savings of $37 for payers and $223 for providers. Scenarios 1, 2, and 3 produced savings of $137, $189, and $293 for payers, and $339, $713, and $809 for providers, respectively. Limitations: Models are simulations of real-world clinical processes, and are not sensitive to variations in clinical practice driven by differences in physician practice styles, differences in facility-level practice patterns, and patient comorbidities expected to exacerbate the clinical impact of CAP. Hospital models are limited to costs and do not consider differences in revenue associated with each approach. Conclusions: Introducing MMBV to the current SOC diagnostic process is likely to be cost-saving to both hospitals and payers when considering impacts on antibiotic distribution, hospital admission rate, hospital LOS, and DRG reallocation.] you can assume that [Introducing a host-response diagnostic, MeMed BV, to the current SOC diagnostic process for patients with community-acquired pneumonia is cost-saving to both hospitals and payers.].

Question: Given [A methyltransferase-defective vesicular stomatitis virus-based SARS-CoV-2 vaccine candidate provides complete protection against SARS-CoV-2 infection in hamsters. The current pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has led to dramatic economic and health burdens. Although the worldwide SARS-CoV-2 vaccination campaign has begun, exploration of other vaccine candidates is needed due to uncertainties with the current approved vaccines, such as durability of protection, cross-protection against variant strains, and costs of long-term production and storage. In this study, we developed a methyltransferase-defective recombinant vesicular stomatitis virus (mtdVSV)based SARS-CoV-2 vaccine candidate. We generated mtdVSVs expressing SARS-CoV-2 full-length spike (S) protein, S1, or its receptor-binding domain (RBD). All of these recombinant viruses grew to high titers in mammalian cells despite high attenuation in cell culture. The SARS-CoV-2 S protein and its truncations were highly expressed by the mtdVSV vector. These mtdVSV-based vaccine candidates were completely attenuated in both immunocompetent and immunocompromised mice. Among these constructs, mtdVSV-S induced high levels of SARS-CoV-2-specific neutralizing antibodies (NAbs) and Th1-biased T-cell immune responses in mice. In Syrian golden hamsters, the serum levels of SARS-CoV-2-specific NAbs triggered by mtdVSV-S were higher than the levels of NAbs in convalescent plasma from recovered COVID-19 patients. In addition, hamsters immunized with mtdVSV-S were completely protected against SARS-CoV-2 replication in lung and nasal turbinate tissues, cytokine storm, and lung pathology. Collectively, our data demonstrate that mtdVSV expressing SARS-CoV-2 S protein is a safe and highly efficacious vaccine candidate against SARS-CoV-2 infection. IMPORTANCE Viral mRNA cap methyltransferase (MTase) is essential for mRNA stability, protein translation, and innate immune evasion. Thus, viral mRNA cap MTase activity is an excellent target for development of live attenuated or live vectored vaccine candidates. Here, we developed a panel of MTase-defective recombinant vesicular stomatitis virus (mtdVSV)-based SARS-CoV-2 vaccine candidates expressing full-length S, S1, or several versions of the RBD. These mtdVSV-based vaccine candidates grew to high titers in cell culture and were completely attenuated in both immunocompetent and immunocompromised mice. Among these vaccine candidates, mtdVSV-S induces high levels of SARS-CoV-2-specific neutralizing antibodies (Nabs) and Th1-biased immune responses in mice. Syrian golden hamsters immunized with mtdVSV-S triggered SARS-CoV-2-specific NAbs at higher levels than those in convalescent plasma from recovered COVID-19 patients. Furthermore, hamsters immunized with mtdVSV-S were completely protected against SARS-CoV-2 challenge. Thus, mtdVSV is a safe and highly effective vector to deliver SARS-CoV-2 vaccine.] you can assume that [Vesicular stomatitis virus expresses SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein, S1.].

Question: Given [A methyltransferase-defective vesicular stomatitis virus-based SARS-CoV-2 vaccine candidate provides complete protection against SARS-CoV-2 infection in hamsters. The current pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has led to dramatic economic and health burdens. Although the worldwide SARS-CoV-2 vaccination campaign has begun, exploration of other vaccine candidates is needed due to uncertainties with the current approved vaccines, such as durability of protection, cross-protection against variant strains, and costs of long-term production and storage. In this study, we developed a methyltransferase-defective recombinant vesicular stomatitis virus (mtdVSV)based SARS-CoV-2 vaccine candidate. We generated mtdVSVs expressing SARS-CoV-2 full-length spike (S) protein, S1, or its receptor-binding domain (RBD). All of these recombinant viruses grew to high titers in mammalian cells despite high attenuation in cell culture. The SARS-CoV-2 S protein and its truncations were highly expressed by the mtdVSV vector. These mtdVSV-based vaccine candidates were completely attenuated in both immunocompetent and immunocompromised mice. Among these constructs, mtdVSV-S induced high levels of SARS-CoV-2-specific neutralizing antibodies (NAbs) and Th1-biased T-cell immune responses in mice. In Syrian golden hamsters, the serum levels of SARS-CoV-2-specific NAbs triggered by mtdVSV-S were higher than the levels of NAbs in convalescent plasma from recovered COVID-19 patients. In addition, hamsters immunized with mtdVSV-S were completely protected against SARS-CoV-2 replication in lung and nasal turbinate tissues, cytokine storm, and lung pathology. Collectively, our data demonstrate that mtdVSV expressing SARS-CoV-2 S protein is a safe and highly efficacious vaccine candidate against SARS-CoV-2 infection. IMPORTANCE Viral mRNA cap methyltransferase (MTase) is essential for mRNA stability, protein translation, and innate immune evasion. Thus, viral mRNA cap MTase activity is an excellent target for development of live attenuated or live vectored vaccine candidates. Here, we developed a panel of MTase-defective recombinant vesicular stomatitis virus (mtdVSV)-based SARS-CoV-2 vaccine candidates expressing full-length S, S1, or several versions of the RBD. These mtdVSV-based vaccine candidates grew to high titers in cell culture and were completely attenuated in both immunocompetent and immunocompromised mice. Among these vaccine candidates, mtdVSV-S induces high levels of SARS-CoV-2-specific neutralizing antibodies (Nabs) and Th1-biased immune responses in mice. Syrian golden hamsters immunized with mtdVSV-S triggered SARS-CoV-2-specific NAbs at higher levels than those in convalescent plasma from recovered COVID-19 patients. Furthermore, hamsters immunized with mtdVSV-S were completely protected against SARS-CoV-2 challenge. Thus, mtdVSV is a safe and highly effective vector to deliver SARS-CoV-2 vaccine.] you can infer that [Vesicular stomatitis virus expresses SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein, S1.].

Question: Given [Cost impact analysis of novel host-response diagnostic for patients with community-acquired pneumonia in the emergency department. Background: There is significant over-prescription of antibiotics for suspected community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) patients as bacterial and viral pathogens are difficult to differentiate. To address this issue, a host response diagnostic called MeMed BV (MMBV) was developed that accurately differentiates bacterial from viral infection at the point of need by integrating measurements of multiple biomarkers. A literature-based cost-impact model was developed that compared the cost impact and clinical benefits between using the standard of care diagnostics combined with MMBV relative to standard of care diagnostics alone. Methods: The patient population was stratified according to the pneumonia severity index, and cost savings were considered from payer and provider perspectives. Four scenarios were considered. The main analysis considers the cost impact of differences in antibiotic stewardship and resulting adverse events. The first, second, and third scenarios combine the impacts on antibiotic stewardship with changes in hospital admission probability, length of hospital stay and diagnosis related group (DRG) reallocation, and hospital admission probability, length of stay, and DRG reallocation in combination, respectively. Results: The main analysis results show overall per-patient savings of $37 for payers and $223 for providers. Scenarios 1, 2, and 3 produced savings of $137, $189, and $293 for payers, and $339, $713, and $809 for providers, respectively.

Anthrax, by Bacillus anthracis, remains a dreadful fatal hazard worldwide. The currently used anthrax vaccines are plagued by numerous issues that limit their widespread use. As an immunization approach targeting both extracellular antigens and toxins of B. anthracis may achieve better sterile immunity, the present investigation designed a bicistronic secretory anti-anthrax DNA vaccine targeting immune response against toxin and cells. The efficacy of the vaccine was compared with monocistronic DNA vaccines and the currently used anthrax vaccine. For this, mice were immunized with the developed vaccine containing pag (encoding protective antigen to block toxin) and eag genes (encoding EA1 to target cells) of B. anthracis through DNA-prime/Protein-boost (D/P) and DNA prime/DNA-boost (D/D) approaches. There was a >2 and > 5 fold increase in specific antibody level by D/D and D/P approaches respectively, on 42nd days post-immunization (dpi). Serum cytokine profiling showed that both Th1 and Th2 immune responses were elicited, with more Th2 responses in D/P strategy. More importantly, challenge with 100 times LD50 of B. anthracis at 42nd dpi exhibited maximum cumulative survival (83.33 %) by bicistronic D/P approach. Remarkably, immunization with EA1 delayed mortality onset in infection. The study forms the first report on complement-dependent bactericidal activity of antiEA1 antibodies. In short, co-immunization of PA and EA1 through the developed bicistronic DNA vaccine would be an effective immunization approach in anthrax vaccination.

Question: Given [A novel technique of endonasopharyngeal ultrasound-guided transnasopharyngeal needle aspiration in the diagnosis of submucosal recurrence of nasopharyngeal carcinoma after chemoradiotherapy. Background: Recurrence of nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) after chemoradiotherapy is common, but submucosal recurrence of NPC is rare. The final pathological results determine the optimal therapeutic schedule for treatment of NPC recurrence, but tissue retrieval from submucosal lesions is usually difficult. The present study aimed to assess the safety and efficacy of a novel approach of endonasopharyngeal ultrasound-guided transnasopharyngeal needle aspiration (ENUS-TNNA) for submucosal neoplasms in patients with suspected NPC recurrence. Methods: Between March 2017 and June 2021, 11 post-chemoradiotherapy patients with suspected magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings of submucosal recurrence of NPC underwent ENUS-TNNA. The safety and effectiveness of using ENUS-TNNA to sample submucosal neoplasms were evaluated. Results: Needle aspiration biopsies were performed without any incidences in all cases. Out of the 11 patients, nine were diagnosed with submucosal recurrence of NPC via histopathological or cytological evaluations. Of the two puncture-negative cases, one patient had atypical imaging findings and clinical manifestations and was therefore followed-up using MRI. After follow-up for 3 years, this patient was still considered to be cancer-free due to the shrinking diameters of the submucosal lesions. For the other puncture-negative patient, submucosal biopsy samples were obtained using a surgical method. Pathological examination of these biopsies revealed that an angiosarcoma had developed after radiotherapy. There were no severe complications that occurred during the ENUS-TNNA procedure.

Out of the 11 patients, nine were diagnosed with submucosal recurrence of NPC via histopathological or cytological evaluations. Of the two puncture-negative cases, one patient had atypical imaging findings and clinical manifestations and was therefore followed-up using MRI. After follow-up for 3 years, this patient was still considered to be cancer-free due to the shrinking diameters of the submucosal lesions. For the other puncture-negative patient, submucosal biopsy samples were obtained using a surgical method. Pathological examination of these biopsies revealed that an angiosarcoma had developed after radiotherapy. There were no severe complications that occurred during the ENUS-TNNA procedure. Conclusion: ENUS-TNNA is a safe, effective, and minimally invasive approach to obtain tissue samples from the submucosal region of the nasopharynx for patients with suspected NPC recurrence.] you can imply that [Endonasopharyngeal ultrasound-guided transnasopharyngeal needle aspiration can cause submucosal recurrence of nasopharyngeal carcinoma after chemoradiotherapy.].

Question: Given [Effect of the local application of bupivacaine in early pain control following impacted mandibular third molar surgery: A randomized controlled study. Background. Postoperative pain is one of the main complications following impacted mandibular third molar (IMTM) surgery. Objectives. The aim of this study was to assess the effect of the local application of bupivacaine on reducing early postoperative pain following IMTM surgery. Material and methods. A prospective, single-blinded, randomized controlled study was conducted on 40 patients who had undergone the surgical removal of an IMTM under local anesthesia. In the study group (n = 20), absorbable gelatin sponge (AGS) soaked in 3 mL of 0.5% plain bupivacaine hydrochloride was locally applied in the post-extraction socket. In the control group (n = 20), AGS soaked in 3 mL of normal saline was used. Pain intensity was assessed using a pain numerical rating scale (NRS) 4 and 12 h postoperatively. The variables were compared between the 2 groups and probability values <0.05 were considered statistically significant. Results. The pain scores in the study group were significantly lower than those recorded in the control group at 4 h postoperatively (p = 0.003), whereas the difference in the pain scores between the 2 groups 12 h after surgery was not statistically significant (p = 0.443).

Question: Given [COVID-19 vaccine mRNA-1273 elicits a protective immune profile in mice that is not associated with vaccine-enhanced disease upon SARS-CoV-2 challenge. Vaccine-associated enhanced respiratory disease (VAERD) was previously observed in some preclinical models of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and MERS coronavirus vaccines. We used the SARS coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) mouse-adapted, passage 10, lethal challenge virus (MA10) mouse model of acute lung injury to evaluate the immune response and potential for immunopathology in animals vaccinated with research-grade mRNA-1273. Whole-inactivated virus or heat-denatured spike protein subunit vaccines with alum designed to elicit low-potency antibodies and Th2-skewed CD4+ T cells resulted in reduced viral titers and weight loss post challenge but more severe pathological changes in the lung compared to saline-immunized animals. In contrast, a protective dose of mRNA-1273 induced favorable humoral and cellular immune responses that protected from viral replication in the upper and lower respiratory tract upon challenge. A subprotective dose of mRNA-1273 reduced viral replication and limited histopathological manifestations compared to animals given saline.

Question: Given [A phase 1 study of the pan-bromodomain and extraterminal inhibitor mivebresib (ABBV-075) alone or in combination with venetoclax in patients with relapsed/refractory acute myeloid leukemia. Background: Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a heterogenous malignancy driven by genetic and epigenetic factors. Inhibition of bromodomain and extraterminal (BET) proteins, epigenetic readers that play pivotal roles in the regulation of genes relevant to cancer pathogenesis, constitutes a novel AML treatment approach. Methods: In this first-in-human study of the pan-BET inhibitor mivebresib as monotherapy (MIV-mono) or in combination with venetoclax (MIV-Ven), the safety profile, efficacy, and pharmacodynamics of mivebresib were determined in patients with relapsed/refractory AML (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier NCT02391480). Mivebresib was administered at 3 monotherapy dose levels (1.5, 2.0, or 2.5 mg) or in combination with venetoclax (400 or 800 mg). Results: Forty-four patients started treatment: of 19 who started MIV-mono, 5 went on to receive MIV-Ven combination therapy after disease progression and a washout period. Twenty-five patients started MIV-Ven, resulting in a total of 30 patients treated with the combination. The most common mivebresib-related treatment-emergent adverse events were dysgeusia (74%), decreased appetite (42%), and diarrhea (42%) in the MIV-mono group and decreased appetite (44%), vomiting (44%), and nausea (40%) in the MIV-Ven group. Serious adverse events occurred in 14 patients (74%) who received MIV-mono and in 22 patients (88%) who received MIV-Ven. In the MIV-mono group, responses were complete remission with incomplete blood count recovery in 1 patient and resistant disease in 15 patients. In the MIV-Ven group, responses were complete remission in 2 patients, partial remission in 2 patients, morphologic leukemia-free state in 2 patients, resistant disease in 12 patients, and aplasia in 1 patient. The pharmacodynamic effects of mivebresib were proportional to dose and drug exposure. Conclusions: Mivebresib was tolerated and showed antileukemic effects as monotherapy and in combination with venetoclax in patients with relapsed/refractory AML.

No effective antiviral drugs and vaccines are available for the treatment of patients with severe coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19). Therefore, available, safe, and inexpensive drugs and supplements such as melatonin are among the proposed options for controlling inflammation. We did a randomized, single-blind study in Imam Khomeini Hospital between June 30, 2020, and August 5, 2020. Mild to moderate COVID-19 patients aged 25-65 years were eligible to enter the study based on chest CT scan, clinical symptoms, and physician diagnosis. The intervention group was prescribed 6 mg of oral melatonin for 2 weeks, which consumed half an hour before bedtime every night in low light conditions. Clinical symptoms and C-reactive protein (CRP) were measured before and after treatment in the melatonin received and control (regular medications) groups. Among screened patients with COVID-19, 14 patients were assigned to receive melatonin, and 17 patients were considered as controls. A significant difference (p=0.005) between CRP 1 and CRP 2 levels (before and after using melatonin) was found in the melatonin group while this difference (p=0.069) was not significant in the control group. Also, the percentage of recovery (based on symptoms) in patients who took melatonin was higher than that of patients in the control group (85.7% VS 47.1%). The result of this study confirmed the effectiveness of melatonin in mild to moderate outpatients with COVID-19. More clinical trials on elderly, diabetic, obese patients and severe cases are suggested in future studies.] you can imply that [A melatonin supplement can be used to control coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) inflammation.].

Question: Given [Short-term fenofibrate treatment improves ultrastructure of hepatocytes of old rats. Introduction. Fenofibrate (FN) is a hypolipemic drug used for the treatment of mixed dyslipidemia. Since in our previous study FN administration to young and old rats adversely affected the serum activity of liver marker enzymes, we decided to examine the effects of FN on liver ultrastructure of young and old animals. Material and methods. Young and old rats were fed standard rodent chow supplemented with 0.1% FN for 30 days. Liver samples obtained from animals under full anesthesia were processed by routine methods to obtain ultrathin and histological sections for the examination by light microscopy (LM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Furthermore, liver lysates were analyzed by Western blotting for the expression of the autophagy-related proteins LC3A/B and beclin 1. Results. The ultrastructure of hepatocytes in both age groups was well-preserved, with the presence of abundant mitochondria, numerous peroxisomes and lysosomes, glycogen stored in the form of rosettes, and occasionally autolysosomes. However, hepatocytes of old control rats contained less mitochondria and peroxisomes, and more lipid droplets than cells of young animals. The effects of FN on liver ultrastructure were age-depended. FN increased the relative number of mitochondria and peroxisomes in the hepatocytes of old, and did not af-fect their number in young rats. Moreover, FN decreased and increased the relative number of lipid droplets in the hepatocytes of old and young rats, respectively. At the LM level, Oil Red O staining revealed smaller and larger lipid droplets within hepatocytes and non-parenchymal liver cells. In the livers of young and old rats lipid droplets were distributed mainly in the periportal zones of hepatic lobules. Morphometric analysis confirmed that livers of control old rats contained more lipid-stainable areas than those of young ones; however, no effect of FN was observed either in young or old rats. Despite larger size of autolysosomes and autophagic vacuoles in hepatocytes of old rats, the expression of autophagy-related proteins did not differ in the livers of control and fenofibrate-treated young and old animals. Conclusions. The results of our study suggest that fenofibrate, apart from its hypolipemic action, may have ben-eficial effect on the energy metabolism in the liver of old individuals by increasing the number of mitochondria and peroxisomes in hepatocytes.] you can assume that [An in vitro study using the hepatocytes of old rats suggests that fenofibrate may have a beneficial effect on the energy metabolism in the liver of old individuals.].

Question: Given [A placebo-controlled, randomised pilot trial of N-acetylcysteine or placebo for cessation of tobacco smoking.

N-acetylcysteine (NAC) is a nutraceutical supplement that has shown efficacy compared to placebo in previous pilot studies for assisting smokers to quit or reduce their consumption of cigarettes. A double-blind, randomised trial with a treatment period of 16 weeks and a final follow-up at 42 weeks was conducted comparing 1.8g of effervescent NAC per day (n=47) with placebo (n=47) as an aide to smoking cessation. Both study arms received adjunctive online support through the QuitCoach program. Participants reported smoking at each timepoint (baseline and weeks 8, 16 & 42), which was confirmed through salivary cotinine and exhaled carbon monoxide testing. Primary and secondary analyses were undertaken using a modified intent-to-treat basis, including all participants with at least one valid post baseline outcome, regardless of treatment received or their withdrawal from the study. There was no significant difference in smoking outcomes between intervention groups among the 24 participants that competed follow-up. There were no significant differences in age, gender, or body mass index (BMI) between the groups lost to follow-up or recorded at follow-up. This study found no evidence to support NAC as a therapy for smoking cessation. The negative outcome could be the result of lack of treatment efficacy, or alternatively, small sample size, participant retention difficulties, dose, or duration of follow-up.

Question: Given [Differences in medication usage of dental patients by age, gender, race/ethnicity and insurance status. BACKGROUND: Limited studies have investigated the medication profile of young adult dental patients despite the high prevalence of prescription opioid abuse in this population. OBJECTIVE: This study investigated the extent and differences in medication usage of dental patients older than 18 years by age, race/ethnicity, gender, insurance status and mechanism of action in an academic dental clinic setting. METHODS: Using an automated approach, medication names in the electronic dental record were retrieved and classified according to the National Drug Code directory. Descriptive statistics, multivariable ANOVA and Post hoc tests were performed to detect differences in the number of medications by patient demographics. RESULTS: Of the 11,220 adult patients, 53 percent reported taking at least one medication with significant differences in medication usage by demographics. Hydroxymethylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase inhibitors (21-36%), and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (19-23%) ranked the top two medication classes among patients 55 years and older. Opioid agonists (7-14%), and Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors (SSRIs) (5-12%) ranked the top two medication classes among patients aged 18-54 years. CONCLUSIONS: The results underscore the importance of dental providers to review medical and medication histories of patients regardless of their age to avoid adverse events and to determine patient's risk for opioid abuse.

Question: Given [Safety of intravenous tranexamic acid in patients undergoing supratentorial meningiomas resection: Protocol for a randomised, parallel-group, placebo control, non-inferiority trial. Introduction Growing evidence recommends antifibrinolytic agent tranexamic acid (TXA) to reduce blood loss and transfusions rate in various surgical settings. However, postoperative seizure, as one of the major adverse effects of TXA infusion, has been a concern that restricts its utility in neurosurgery. Methods and analysis This is a randomised, placebo-controlled, non-inferiority trial. Patients with supratentorial meningiomas and deemed suitable for surgical resection will be recruited in the trial. Patients will be randomised to receive either a single administration of 20 mg/kg TXA or a placebo of the same volume with a 1:1 allocation ratio after anaesthesia induction. The primary endpoint is the cumulative incidence of early postoperative seizures within 7 days after craniotomy. Secondary outcomes include the incidence of non-seizure complications, changes of haemoglobin level from baseline, intraoperative blood loss, erythrocyte transfusion volume, Karnofsky Performance Status, all-cause mortality, and length of stay, and total hospitalisation cost. Ethics and dissemination This trial is registered at ClinicalTrial.gov and approved by the Chinese Ethics Committee of Registering Clinical Trials (ChiECRCT20200224).

Question: Given [A rare presentation of panitumumab-involved interstitial lung disease: Spontaneous pneumomediastinum. Introduction: Developments in targeted molecular therapies have considerably improved patient survival in cancer. Panitumumab is a monoclonal antibody against the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). It is used to treat metastatic colorectal carcinoma. Although panitumumab is well tolerated in most patients, pulmonary toxicity, especially interstitial lung disease (ILD), is a life-threatening condition. The presentation of panitumumab-induced ILD with spontaneous pneumomediastinum and subcutaneous emphysema is rarely reported. Case report: We describe a 61-year-old male with metastatic colorectal carcinoma treated with FOLFIRI (folinic acid, 5-fluorouracil, irinotecan) and panitumumab. He presented to our hospital with a complaint of severe dyspnea. On the evaluation of dyspnea, the patient was diagnosed with ILD. Management and outcome: After exclusion of other common causes of pneumomediastinum and subcutaneous emphysema, panitumumab was attributed as a cause of ILD. Oxygen therapy via high flow nasal cannula and intravenous methylprednisolone regimen was started. After two weeks, the patient became asymptomatic with the radiologic amelioration. Discussion: Panitumumab-induced ILD is associated with a poor prognosis and might occur randomly in one year after the drug administration. The possibility of the disease should be considered on every admission.

Question: Given [Cancer-Associated Splanchnic Vein Thrombosis. Splanchnic vein thrombosis (SVT), which includes portal, mesenteric, and splenic vein thrombosis and the Budd-Chiari syndrome, is an infrequent manifestation of venous thromboembolism (VTE). Like typical site VTE, SVT is also frequently associated with cancer, particularly intra-abdominal solid malignancies and myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs). The clinical presentation of SVT is nonspecific. Symptoms may be related to the underlying malignancy, and thrombosis is incidentally diagnosed by imaging studies for cancer staging or follow-up in a substantial proportion of cases. The occurrence of SVT predicts worse prognosis in patients with liver or pancreatic cancer and, not uncommonly, SVT may precede the diagnosis of cancer. Therefore, the occurrence of an apparently unprovoked SVT should prompt careful patient evaluation for the presence of an underlying malignancy or MPN. Cancer patients carry a high risk of VTE extension and recurrence and long-term anticoagulant treatment is suggested in the absence of high risk of bleeding. Either LMWH or direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) are suggested for the treatment of patients with cancer-related SVT, although limited experience is available on the use of DOACs in these settings.

Question: Given [Exosome-mediated miR-7-5p delivery enhances the anticancer effect of Everolimus via blocking MNK/eIF4E axis in non-small cell lung cancer. Everolimus is a kind of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitors. Activated mitogen-activated protein kinase interacting kinases/eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E (MNK/eIF4E) axis plays a crucial role in resistance to Everolimus in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The eIF4E phosphorylation increased by mTOR inhibitors is mainly mediated by MNKs. However, the mechanisms are poorly understood. Recently, extensive reprogramming of miRNA profiles has also been found after long-term mTOR inhibitor exposure. Our previous studies have confirmed that tumor suppressor miR-7-5p is decreased in A549 cells after treatment with Everolimus. Exactly, MNK1 is the target of miR-7-5p. In this study, we investigated the biological functions and potential molecular mechanisms of miR-7-5p in the NSCLC undergoing treatment with Everolimus. We confirmed that Everolimus targeted mTORC1 inducing NSCLC cells to secrete miR-7-5p-loaded exosomes in Rab27A and Rab27B-dependent manners. Loss of intracellular miR-7-5p induced phosphorylation of MNK/eIF4E axis, but a supplement of extra exosomal miR-7-5p could reverse it. Of note, both low expression of miR-7-5p and elevated MNK1 protein were associated with a poor prognosis of NSCLC. Both endogenous miR-7-5p and exo-miR-7-5p enhanced the therapeutic efficacy of Everolimus by inhibiting the proliferation, migration, and metastasis of NSCLC in vitro and in vivo. The combination of miR-7-5p with Everolimus induced apoptosis to exhibit a synergistic anticancer therapeutic efficacy through dual abrogation of MNK/eIF4E and mTOR in NSCLC. In conclusion, Everolimus decreases the intracellular miR-7-5p by releasing of miR-7-5p loaded exosomes from NSCLC cells in Rab27A and Rab27B dependent manners. Either endogenous miR-7-5p or exo-miR-7-5p combined with Everolimus can enhance the anticancer efficacy by targeting MNK/eIF4E axis and mTOR.

Question: Given [A stochastic mixed effects model to assess treatment effects and fluctuations in home-measured peak expiratory flow and the association with exacerbation risk in asthma. Home-based measures of lung function, inflammation, symptoms, and medication use are frequently collected in respiratory clinical trials. However, new statistical approaches are needed to make better use of the information contained in these data-rich variables. In this work, we use data from two phase III asthma clinical trials demonstrating the benefit of benralizumab treatment to develop a novel longitudinal mixed effects model of peak expiratory flow (PEF), a lung function measure easily captured at home using a hand-held device. The model is based on an extension of the mixed effects modeling framework to incorporate stochastic differential equations and allows for quantification of several statistical properties of a patient's PEF data: the longitudinal trend, long-term fluctuations, and day-to-day variability. These properties are compared between treatment groups and related to a patient's exacerbation risk using a repeated time-to-event model. The mixed effects model adequately described the observed data from the two clinical trials, and model parameters were accurately estimated. Benralizumab treatment was shown to improve a patient's average PEF level and reduce long-term fluctuations. Both of these effects were shown to be associated with a lower exacerbation risk. The day-to-day variability was neither significantly affected by treatment nor associated with exacerbation risk. Our work shows the potential of a stochastic model-based analysis of home-based lung function measures to support better estimation and understanding of treatment effects and disease stability.

Question: Given [ALCAM regulates multiple myeloma chemoresistant side population. Drug-resistance is a major problem preventing a cure in patients with multiple myeloma (MM). Previously, we demonstrated that activated-leukocyte-cell-adhesion-molecule (ALCAM) is a prognostic factor in MM and inhibits EGF/EGFR-initiated MM clonogenicity. In this study, we further showed that the ALCAM-EGF/EGFR axis regulated the MM side population (SP)-mediated drug-resistance. ALCAM-knockdown MM cells displayed an enhanced ratio of SP cells in the presence of bone marrow stromal cells (BMSCs) or with the supplement of recombinant EGF. SP MM cells were resistant to chemotherapeutics melphalan or bortezomib. Drug treatment stimulated SP-genesis. Mechanistically, EGFR, primed with EGF, activated the hedgehog pathway and promoted the SP ratio; meanwhile, ALCAM inhibited EGFR downstream pro-MM cell signaling. Further, SP MM cells exhibited an increased number of mitochondria compared to the main population. Interference of the mitochondria function strongly inhibited SP-genesis. Animal studies showed that combination therapy with both an anti-MM agent and EGFR inhibitor gefitinib achieved prolonged MM-bearing mice survival. Hence, our work identifies ALCAM as a novel negative regulator of MM drug-resistance, and EGFR inhibitors may be used to improve MM therapeutic efficacy.] you can assume that [The activated leukocyte-cell adhesion molecule (ALCAM) is a positive regulator of drug resistance in multiple myeloma.].

Question: Given [Anti-CCR4 treatment depletes regulatory T cells and leads to clinical activity in a canine model of advanced prostate cancer. Background Targeting regulatory T cell (Treg) infiltration is an emerging strategy for cancer immunotherapy. However, its efficacy in advanced prostate cancer remains unclear. Here, we showed the therapeutic efficacy of anti-Treg treatment in a canine model of advanced prostate cancer. Methods We used dogs with naturally occurring prostate cancer to study the molecular mechanism underlying Treg infiltration and the effect of anti-Treg treatment. Tumor-infiltrating Tregs was evaluated by immunohistochemistry, and the association with prognosis was examined in dogs with spontaneous prostate cancer. The molecular mechanism of Treg infiltration was explored by RNA sequencing and protein analyses. A non-randomized canine clinical trial was conducted to define the therapeutic potential of anti-Treg treatment for advanced prostate cancer. Human prostate cancer datasets were analyzed to compare gene expression in dogs and humans. Results Tumor-infiltrating Tregs were associated with poor prognosis in dogs bearing spontaneous prostate cancer. RNA sequencing and protein analyses showed a possible link between the CCL17-CCR4 pathway and the increase of tumor-infiltrating Tregs. Dogs with advanced prostate cancer responded to mogamulizumab, a monoclonal antibody targeting CCR4, with decreased circulating Tregs, improved survival, and low incidence of clinically relevant adverse events. Urinary CCL17 concentration and BRAF V595E mutation were independently predictive of the response to mogamulizumab. Analysis of a transcriptomic dataset of human prostate cancer showed that the CCL17-CCR4 axis correlated with Foxp3. In silico survival analyses revealed that high expression of CCL17 was associated with poor prognosis. Immunohistochemistry confirmed that tumor-infiltrating Tregs expressed CCR4 in human patients with prostate cancer. Conclusions Anti-Treg treatment, through CCR4 blockade, may be a promising therapeutic approach for advanced prostate cancer in dogs and some population of human patients.

Question: Given [Gene Therapy Overexpressing Neuregulin 1 Type I in Combination With Neuregulin 1 Type III Promotes Functional Improvement in the SOD1G93A ALS Mice. Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a fatal neurodegenerative disease affecting the neuromuscular system for which currently there is no effective therapy. Motoneuron (MN) degeneration involves several complex mechanisms, including surrounding glial cells and skeletal muscle contributions. Neuregulin 1 (NRG1) is a trophic factor present particularly in MNs and neuromuscular junctions. Our previous studies revealed that gene therapy overexpressing the isoform I (NRG1-I) in skeletal muscles as well as overexpressing the isoform III (NRG1-III) directly in the central nervous system are both effective in preserving MNs in the spinal cord of ALS mice, opening novel therapeutic approaches. In this study, we combined administration of both viral vectors overexpressing NRG1-I in skeletal muscles and NRG1-III in spinal cord of the SOD1G93A mice in order to obtain a synergistic effect. The results showed that the combinatorial gene therapy increased preservation of MNs and of innervated neuromuscular junctions and reduced glial reactivity in the spinal cord of the treated SOD1G93A mice. Moreover, NRG1 isoforms overexpression improved motor function of hindlimb muscles and delayed the onset of clinical disease. However, this combinatory gene therapy did not produce a synergic effect compared with single therapies, suggesting an overlap between NRG1-I and NRG1-III activated pathways and their beneficial effects.] you can assume that [Gene Therapy Overexpressing Neuregulin 1 Type I in Combination With Neuregulin 1 Type III synergistically Promotes Functional Improvement in the SOD1G93A Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis Mice.].

Question: Given [Abdominal Ischemia-Reperfusion Induced Cardiac Dysfunction Can Be Prevented by MitoTEMPO. Background: Cardiac dysfunction is secondary to acute mesenteric ischemia (AMI) and abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAA). The underlying cause of distant organ damage in the heart is the formation of oxidative stress caused by ischemia-reperfusion. In this study, we investigated the possible protective effects of a novel mitochondria-targeted antioxidant MitoTEMPO on contractile dysfunction and structural defects of the rat papillary muscle caused by abdominal ischemia-reperfusion (AIR). Methods and Results: In the experiments, adult Wistar-Albino rats were used and animals were divided randomly into 3 groups; sham-operated group (SHAM), an IR group that had aortic cross-clamping for 1 h followed by 2 h reperfusion, and a third group that received protective 0.7 mg/kg/day MitoTEMPO injection for 28-day before IR. As a result, it was observed that MitoTEMPO injection had a protective effect on the mechanical activities and structural properties of the papillary muscle impaired by AIR. Our study also showed that AIR disrupted the contractile function of the papillary muscle for each stimulation frequency and post-potentiation responses tested. This is common for each measured and calculated mechanical parameter and MitoTEMPO injection showed its protective effects. Conclusion: Consequently, calcium homeostasis seems to be impaired by AIR, and MitoTEMPO may exert its protective effect through energy metabolism by directly targeting the mitochondria.] you can assume that [A novel mitochondria-targeted antioxidant MitoTEMPO can prevent abdominal ischemia-reperfusion-induced cardiac dysfunction in rats.].

Question: Given [Acinic Cell Carcinoma of the Breast: Report of a Case With Immunohistochemical and Next-Generation Sequencing Studies. Acinic cell carcinoma of the breast is a rare subtype of triple-negative breast cancer that recapitulates the appearance of tumors seen in salivary glands. We present the case of a 42-year-old woman with an irregular, nontender mass above the left nipple during routine obstetric appointment at 24 weeks gestation. She was subsequently diagnosed with triple-negative invasive ductal carcinoma of the left breast, Nottingham grade 3, via core needle biopsy. She was treated with neoadjuvant therapy (doxorubucin and cyclophosphamide) antenatally and paclitaxel in the postpartum period followed by left mastectomy with sentinel node biopsy. The carcinoma in the mastectomy specimen showed a spectrum of morphologic patterns with immunohistochemistry revealing strong positivity for alpha-1-antichymotrypsin, epithelial membrane antigen (EMA), lysozyme, and S100. The histomorphology paired with the immunoprofile led us to the diagnosis of acinic cell carcinoma. We retrospectively performed immunostains in the core biopsy specimen, which demonstrated GATA-3 and DOG-1 positivity. Next-generation sequencing of the postneoadjuvant specimen using a 70-gene panel revealed 2 single-nucleotide variant (SNV) mutations: tumor protein 53 (TP53) (c.747G>T) SNV mutation and rearranged during transfection (RET) (c.2899G>A) SNV mutation.] you can assume that [Immunohistochemistry analysis for alpha-1-antichymotrypsin, epithelial membrane antigen (EMA), lysozyme, and S100 can be used for the diagnosis of acinic cell carcinoma.].

Question: Given [Acinic Cell Carcinoma of the Breast: Report of a Case With Immunohistochemical and Next-Generation Sequencing Studies. Acinic cell carcinoma of the breast is a rare subtype of triple-negative breast cancer that recapitulates the appearance of tumors seen in salivary glands. We present the case of a 42-year-old woman with an irregular, nontender mass above the left nipple during routine obstetric appointment at 24 weeks gestation. She was subsequently diagnosed with triple-negative invasive ductal carcinoma of the left breast, Nottingham grade 3, via core needle biopsy. She was treated with neoadjuvant therapy (doxorubucin and cyclophosphamide) antenatally and paclitaxel in the postpartum period followed by left mastectomy with sentinel node biopsy. The carcinoma in the mastectomy specimen showed a spectrum of morphologic patterns with immunohistochemistry revealing strong positivity for alpha-1-antichymotrypsin, epithelial membrane antigen (EMA), lysozyme, and S100. The histomorphology paired with the immunoprofile led us to the diagnosis of acinic cell carcinoma. We retrospectively performed immunostains in the core biopsy specimen, which demonstrated GATA-3 and DOG-1 positivity.

Question: Given [RON Mediates Tumor-Promoting Effects in Endometrial Adenocarcinoma. Endometrial adenocarcinoma is one of the most prevalent female reproductive tract cancers in the world, and the development of effective treatment is still the main goal of its current research. Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) plays a significant part in the occurrence and development of epithelial carcinoma, including endometrial adenocarcinoma. Recepteur d'origine nantais (RON) induces EMT and promotes proliferation, migration, and invasion in various epithelial-derived cancers, but its role in endometrial adenocarcinoma is still poorly studied. The purpose of this study is to verify the overexpression of RON in endometrial adenocarcinoma and to explore its specific roles. RON expression in tumor lesions was verified by immunohistochemical staining, HEC-1B cells were used to construct stable cell lines with RON overexpression or knockdown to investigate the effects of RON on the function of endometrial adenocarcinoma cells, and xenotransplantation experiment was carried out in nude mice to explore the effect of RON on the growth of endometrial adenocarcinoma in vivo. This study revealed that RON could promote the proliferation, migration, and invasion of HEC-1B cells and induce EMT, and these effects were regulated through the Smad pathway. RON overexpression could promote growth of endometrial adenocarcinoma cells in nude mice, while its inhibitor BMS777607 could restrict this role.

Question: Given [Acquired temozolomide resistance in MGMTlow gliomas is associated with regulation of homologous recombination repair by ROCK2. It was reported that MGMTlow gliomas may still be resistant to TMZ, while the mechanisms remain poorly understood. In this study, we demonstrated that rho-associated kinase 2 (ROCK2), a cytoskeleton regulator, was highly expressed in MGMTlow recurrent gliomas, and its expression strongly correlated with poor overall survival (OS) time in a subset of MGMTlow recurrent gliomas patients with TMZ therapy. And we also found that overactive ROCK2 enhanced homologous recombination repair (HR) in TMZ-resistant (TMZ-R) glioma cell lines with low MGMT expression. Silencing ROCK2 impaired HR repair, and induced double-strand break (DSB) and eradicated TMZ-R glioma cells in culture. Notably, in MGMTlow TMZ-R models, as a key factor of HR, ataxia telangiectasia-mutated (ATM) expression was upregulated directly by hyper-activation of ROCK2 to improve HR efficiency. ROCK2 enhanced the binding of transcription factor zinc finger E-box binding homeobox 1 (ZEB1) to ATM promoter for increasing ATM expression. Moreover, ROCK2 transformed ZEB1 into a gene activator via Yes-associated protein 1 (YAP1).

Question: Given [Baicalin suppresses the progression of Type 2 diabetes-induced liver tumor through regulating METTL3/m6A/HKDC1 axis and downstream p-JAK2/STAT1/clevaged Capase3 pathway. Background: Epidemiological and clinical evidence suggests that diabetes increases the risk of liver cancer. Although the co-occurrence of type 2 diabetes (T2D) and liver cancer is becoming more frequent, the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Even though baicalin, extensively used in traditional Chinese medicine (TCM), can control T2D and inhibit liver cancer separately, minimal research is available regarding its possible effect on T2D-induced liver cancer. Thus, in the present study, we aimed to investigate the role of baicalin in T2D-induced hepatocellular cancer, and for the first time, we particularly emphasized the regulation of baicalin in genes RNA m6A in hepatocellular cancer. Methods: Here, we constructed a cell culture model under a high concentration of glucose and a T2D-induced liver tumor model to evaluate the in vitro and in vivo role of baicalin in T2D-induced liver cancer progression. After confirming the suppressive effect of baicalin and the HKDC1 antibody on T2D-induced liver tumors, the epigenetic alterations (DNA 5mC and RNA m6A) of the baicalin-regulated HKDC1 gene were detected using MS and q-PCR. Next, the METTL3 gene-regulated m6A (2854 site) was investigated using SELECT PCR. Finally, the impact of the other three baicalin analogs (baicalein, wogonoside, and wogonin) on tumor inhibition was tested in vivo while verifying the related RNA m6A mechanism. Results: The results showed that baicalin and the HKDC1 antibody suppressed T2D-induced liver tumor progression in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, baicalin significantly inhibited the epigenetic modification (DNA 5mC and RNA m6A) of HKDC1 in HepG2 tumors, mainly targeting the RNA m6A site (2854). The m6A-related gene, METTL3, regulated the RNA m6A site (2854) of HKDC1, which was also restricted by baicalin. Moreover, the study verified that baicalin regulated the METTL3/HKDC1/JAK2/STAT1/caspase-3 pathway in liver cancer cells when exposed to a high glucose concentration. In addition, the three baicalin analogs were proven to regulate the m6A (2854 site) of HKDC1 and suppress T2D-induced liver tumors. Conclusions: The findings of this study revealed that baicalin suppressed T2D-induced liver tumor progression by regulating the METTL3/m6A/HKDC1 axis, which might support its potential application for preventing and treating T2D-induced liver cancer.] you can assume that [Baicalin, extensively used in traditional Chinese medicine, can suppress type 2 diabetes-induced liver tumor progression by regulating the METTL3/m6A/HKDC1 axis.].

BACKGROUND: Patients with hypertension and diabetes mellitus are susceptible to dementia, but regular therapy fails to reduce the risk of dementia. Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists have neuroprotective effects in experimental studies. We aimed to assess the effect of liraglutide, a glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist, on cognitive function and whether its effect was associated with metabolic changes in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. METHODS AND RESULTS: Fifty patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus were recruited in this prospective study. All patients under-went cognitive assessment and brain activation monitoring by functional near-infrared spectroscopy. At 12 weeks, patients in the glucagon-like peptide-1 group acquired better scores in all cognitive tests and showed remarkable improvement in memory and attention (P=0.040) test compared with the control group after multivariable adjustment. Compared with the control group, liraglutide significantly increased activation of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and orbitofrontal cortex brain regions (P=0.0038). After liraglutide treatment, cognitive scores were significantly correlated with changes in these activating brain regions (P<0.05), but no correlation was observed between the changes in cognitive function and changes of body mass index, blood pressure, and glycemic levels. CONCLUSIONS: We concluded that liraglutide improves cognitive decline in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. This benefi-cial effect is independent of its hypoglycemic effect and weight loss.

Question: Given [Identification of one novel epitope targeting p54 protein of African swine fever virus using monoclonal antibody and development of a capable ELISA. African swine fever (ASF) is one of the most lethal viral diseases affecting both domestic pigs and wild boars. The acute infection of the ASF disease in domestic pigs leads to a 100% mortality rate with symptoms including high fever, vascular changes, cyanosis of the skin. Until now, there are no commercial vaccines and antiviral drugs available for ASF control. Therefore, the spread of ASF poses great economic losses to the pig industry and the ecosystems in the affected countries. A rapid and capable method was urgently needed to monitor ASFV-specific antibodies for controlling the spread of ASFV. In this study, we obtained one strain of monoclonal antibody (mAb) against the p54 protein of ASFV, and the target epitope of the mAb was determined to be 175YTHKDLENSL184. The experimental results demonstrated that the monoclonal antibody could successfully recognize the exogenously expressed p54 protein and the chimeric virus constructed in our laboratory. The mAb could be used as a detection tool for the development of ASF vaccine strains. In addition, the ELISA established by using the obtained synthetic epitope peptide as the antigen had high sensitivity, good specificity and showed the great potential for ASF epidemic monitoring and control.] you can assume that [monoclonal antibody against the p54 protein of the African swine fever (ASF) virus can be used for ASF disease therapy.].

Question: Given [Identification of one novel epitope targeting p54 protein of African swine fever virus using monoclonal antibody and development of a capable ELISA. African swine fever (ASF) is one of the most lethal viral diseases affecting both domestic pigs and wild boars. The acute infection of the ASF disease in domestic pigs leads to a 100% mortality rate with symptoms including high fever, vascular changes, cyanosis of the skin. Until now, there are no commercial vaccines and antiviral drugs available for ASF control. Therefore, the spread of ASF poses great economic losses to the pig industry and the ecosystems in the affected countries. A rapid and capable method was urgently needed to monitor ASFV-specific antibodies for controlling the spread of ASFV. In this study, we obtained one strain of monoclonal antibody (mAb) against the p54 protein of ASFV, and the target epitope of the mAb was determined to be 175YTHKDLENSL184. The experimental results demonstrated that the monoclonal antibody could successfully recognize the exogenously expressed p54 protein and the chimeric virus constructed in our laboratory. The mAb could be used as a detection tool for the development of ASF vaccine strains. In addition, the ELISA established by using the obtained synthetic epitope peptide as the antigen had high sensitivity, good specificity and showed the great potential for ASF epidemic monitoring and control.] you can infer that [monoclonal antibody against the p54 protein of the African swine fever (ASF) virus can be used for ASF disease therapy.].

Question: Given [Low molecular weight heparin is useful in adult COVID-19 inpatients. Experience during the first Spanish wave: Observational study. BACKGROUND: The intensity of the thromboprophylaxis needed as a potential factor for preventing inpatient mortality due to coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) remains unclear. OBJECTIVE: To explore the association between anticoagulation intensity and COVID-19 survival. DESIGN AND SETTING: Retrospective observational study in a tertiary-level hospital in Spain. METHODS: Low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) status was ascertained based on prescription at admission. To control for immortal time bias, anticoagulant use was analyzed as a time-dependent variable. RESULTS: 690 patients were included (median age, 72 years). LMWH was administered to 615 patients, starting from hospital admission (89.1%). 410 (66.7%) received prophylactic-dose LMWH; 120 (19.5%), therapeutic-dose LMWH; and another 85 (13.8%) who presented respiratory failure, high D-dimer levels (> 3 mg/l) and non-worsening of inflammation markers received prophylaxis of intermediate-dose LMWH. The overall inpatient-mortality rate was 38.5%. The anticoagulant nonuser group presented higher mortality risk than each of the following groups: Any LMWH users (HR 2.1; 95% CI: 1.40-3.15); the prophylactic-dose heparin group (HR 2.39; 95% CI, 1.57-3.64); and the users of heparin dose according to biomarkers (HR 6.52; 95% CI, 2.95-14.41). 3.4% of the patients experienced major hemorrhage. 2.8% of the patients developed an episode of thromboembolism. CONCLUSIONS: This observational study showed that LMWH administered at the time of admission was associated with lower mortality among unselected adult COVID-19 inpatients.

Question: Given [Comparison of dexmedetomidine and meperidine for the prevention of shivering following coronary artery bypass graft: study protocol of a randomised controlled trial. IntroductionShivering is a common complication in the postoperative period. The incidence of shivering has been reported to range from 5% to 65% under general anaesthesia and as 33% during epidural anaesthesia. Shivering can increase perioperative risk in patients. Both dexmedetomidine and meperidine are effective agents for the prevention of postanaesthetic shivering. However, few studies have compared the anti-shivering effects of different agents following coronary artery bypass graft (CABG). This study aims to compare the effects of dexmedetomidine and meperidine on the incidence of shivering in patients undergoing CABG.Methods and analysisA total of 180 patients aged 18-75 years, with an American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) grade of II-IV, undergoing elective CABG will be enrolled and randomly assigned to the dexmedetomidine, meperidine and control groups (placebo) in an intended 1:1:1 allocation ratio. The patients will be followed up for 7 days after surgery. The primary outcome is the incidence of shivering within 24 hours postoperatively. The secondary outcomes are the number of remedial drugs used after surgery, the incidence of postoperative hypotension and bradycardia, sedation scores, endotracheal extubation time, intensive care unit length of stay, incidence of postoperative delirium within 7 days after surgery, incidence of postoperative arrhythmias, incidence of postoperative nausea and vomiting, average hospital length of stay and mortality rate 30 days after surgery.Ethics and disseminationThe study protocol was approved by the ethics committee of The First Affiliated Hospital of Shandong First Medical University on 20 January 2021 (YXLL-KY-2021(002)) and registered at ClinicalTrials.gov.

Question: Given [Albumin Oxidation Status in Sepsis Patients Treated With Albumin or Crystalloids. Inflammation and oxidative stress characterize sepsis and determine its severity. In this study, we investigated the relationship between albumin oxidation and sepsis severity in a selected cohort of patients from the Albumin Italian Outcome Study (ALBIOS). A retrospective analysis was conducted on the oxidation forms of human albumin [human mercapto-albumin (HMA), human non-mercapto-albumin form 1 (HNA1) and human non-mercapto-albumin form 2 (HNA2)] in 60 patients with severe sepsis or septic shock and 21 healthy controls. The sepsis patients were randomized (1:1) to treatment with 20% albumin and crystalloid solution or crystalloid solution alone. The albumin oxidation forms were measured at day 1 and day 7. To assess the albumin oxidation forms as a function of oxidative stress, the 60 sepsis patients, regardless of the treatment, were grouped based on baseline sequential organ failure assessment (SOFA) score as surrogate marker of oxidative stress. At day 1, septic patients had significantly lower levels of HMA and higher levels of HNA1 and HNA2 than healthy controls. HMA and HNA1 concentrations were similar in patients treated with albumin or crystalloids at day 1, while HNA2 concentration was significantly greater in albumin-treated patients (p < 0.001). On day 7, HMA was significantly higher in albumin-treated patients, while HNA2 significantly increased only in the crystalloids-treated group, reaching values comparable with the albumin group. When pooling the septic patients regardless of treatment, albumin oxidation was similar across all SOFA groups at day 1, but at day 7 HMA was lower at higher SOFA scores. Mortality rate was independently associated with albumin oxidation levels measured at day 7 (HMA log-rank = 0.027 and HNA2 log-rank = 0.002), irrespective of treatment group. In adjusted regression analyses for 90-day mortality, this effect remained significant for HMA and HNA2. Our data suggest that the oxidation status of albumin is modified according to the time of exposure to oxidative stress (differences between day 1 and day 7). After 7 days of treatment, lower SOFA scores correlate with higher albumin antioxidant capacity. The trend toward a positive effect of albumin treatment, while not statistically significant, warrants further investigation.] you can assume that [20% albumin can be used as a drug therapy for sepsis.].

Question: Given [Protocol-based cardiotoxicity monitoring in hydroxychloroquine medicated COVID-19 pediatric patients. Introduction/objectives: By May 2020, SARS-CoV-2 had caused more than 400 000 deaths worldwide. Initially, hydroxychloroquine was a treatment option for COVID-19. More recent studies have questioned its safety and efficacy and, until stronger evidence is available, it was suspended from therapy protocols. We describe our experience treating COVID-19 Portuguese pediatric patients with hydroxychloroquine, having applied a protocol for monitoring cardiac toxicity. Methods: An observational retrospective study of COVID-19 pediatric patients, admitted from March to April 2020 and treated with hydroxychloroquine. Cardiotoxicity was assessed using ECG recordings and corrected QT-time (QTc). Patients were classified into risk-groups depending on QTc value: normal, slightly elevated or severely elevated (>500 ms). Results: Total of 14 patients, with a median age of 10 years [four months; 17 years], treated with hydroxychloroquine for a median of five days. Hydroxychloroquine was used in monotherapy in six patients (mainly mild disease with comorbidities), and in association with lopinavir/ritonavir (3) and azithromycin (5) in moderate to severe disease. Other QT-prolonging therapies were used in five patients: oseltamivir (3), omeprazole (1), morphine (1) and ketamine (1). At 48 hours of treatment, two patients temporarily suspended hydroxychloroquine due to QTc prolongation (>500 ms). All patients completed the whole treatment. No other side effects or deaths occurred. Conclusion: Clinical trials are evolving to define hydroxychloroquine effectivity and safety.

Question: Given [An investigation on power loss of an out-to-in body wireless radio frequency link. BACKGROUND: Implantable medical sensors for monitoring and transmitting physiological signals like blood glucose, blood oxygen, electrocardiogram, and endoscopic video present a new way for health care and disease prevention. Nevertheless, the signals transmitted by implantable sensors undergo significant attenuation as they propagate through various biological tissue layers. OBJECTIVE: This paper mainly aims to investigate the power loss of an out-to-in body wireless radio frequency link at 2.45 GHz. METHODS: Two simulation models including the single-layer human tissue model and three-layer human tissue model were established, applying the finite element method (FEM). Two experiments using physiological saline and excised porcine tissue were conducted to measure the power loss of a wireless radio frequency link at 2.45 GHz. Various communication distances and implantation depths were investigated in our study. RESULTS: The results from our measurements show that each 2 cm increase in implantation depth will result in an additional power loss of about 10 dB. The largest difference in values obtained from the measurements and the simulations is within 4 dB, which indicates that the experiments are in good agreement with the simulations. CONCLUSIONS: These results are significant for the estimate of how electromagnetic energy changes after propagating through human tissues, which can be used as a reference for the link budget of transceivers or other implantable medical devices.

Question: Given [Netrin-1 expression and targeting in multiple myeloma.

Netrin 1 is currently being evaluated as a therapeutic target. These receptors, known as dependence receptors, and their ligands, have not yet been extensively explored in hematological malignancies. Here, we performed a screening of various human myeloma cell lines and bone marrow samples from multiple myeloma patients for netrin-1 and its receptors to determine the expression of netrin 1 and its receptors in multiple myeloma as well as to assess the potential anti-myeloma activity of a novel anti-netrin-1 treatment (NP137). Our results showed heterogeneous expression of netrin-1 and its receptors DCC and UNC5H2(B) in six human myeloma lines. Additionally, immunohistochemistry and flow cytometry showed expression of these molecules in a majority of myeloma patient samples. In vitro NP137 did not induce apoptosis of myeloma cell lines yet enhanced the cytotoxicity of bortezomib and dexamethasone. In vivo, NP137 treatment of SCID mice with established RPMI8226 myeloma tumors led to a reduction of tumor size compared to controls.

Question: Given [Anesthesia, Sedation, and Unplanned Extubation of Tracheal Intubation in Children with Severe Pneumonia. We randomly divided 200 children with severe pneumonia who met the indications for tracheal intubation into 2 groups in this prospective study. One group that received dexmedetomidine for sedation was recorded as the dexmedetomidine group (n = 100), and the group that received midazolam for sedation was recorded as the midazolam group (n = 100). We compared the anesthesia sedation scores, time to fall asleep, time to wake up from anesthesia, related hemodynamic parameters, and adverse reactions between the two groups of children. The failure mode and effect analysis method (FMEA) was also used to investigate the causes of unplanned extubation (UEX) of tracheal intubation in 32 children with severe pneumonia. Our conclusion is as follows: (1) Compared with midazolam, the comprehensive effect of dexmedetomidine on children with severe pneumonia undergoing tracheal intubation for anesthesia and sedation is better, it can effectively shorten the anesthesia induction time and the recovery time after stopping the drug, and there are few adverse reactions, which is worthy of application and promotion. (2) UEX is an important risk factor in the monitoring and nursing of children with severe pneumonia tracheal intubation, and the nursing method of PDCA cycle management is particularly important for them.

Here, we performed a screening of various human myeloma cell lines and bone marrow samples from multiple myeloma patients for netrin-1 and its receptors to determine the expression of netrin 1 and its receptors in multiple myeloma as well as to assess the potential anti-myeloma activity of a novel anti-netrin-1 treatment (NP137). Our results showed heterogeneous expression of netrin-1 and its receptors DCC and UNC5H2(B) in six human myeloma lines. Additionally, immunohistochemistry and flow cytometry showed expression of these molecules in a majority of myeloma patient samples. In vitro NP137 did not induce apoptosis of myeloma cell lines yet enhanced the cytotoxicity of bortezomib and dexamethasone. In vivo, NP137 treatment of SCID mice with established RPMI8226 myeloma tumors led to a reduction of tumor size compared to controls. Ex vivo, NP137 lowered the plasma cells percentage in bone marrow aspirates in a fraction of the patient samples analyzed. These results suggest that netrin signaling could constitute a novel therapeutic target in multiple myeloma.] you can imply that [Anti-netrin-1 treatment NP137 has potential anti-myeloma activity.].

Question: Given [Anesthesia, Sedation, and Unplanned Extubation of Tracheal Intubation in Children with Severe Pneumonia. We randomly divided 200 children with severe pneumonia who met the indications for tracheal intubation into 2 groups in this prospective study. One group that received dexmedetomidine for sedation was recorded as the dexmedetomidine group (n = 100), and the group that received midazolam for sedation was recorded as the midazolam group (n = 100). We compared the anesthesia sedation scores, time to fall asleep, time to wake up from anesthesia, related hemodynamic parameters, and adverse reactions between the two groups of children. The failure mode and effect analysis method (FMEA) was also used to investigate the causes of unplanned extubation (UEX) of tracheal intubation in 32 children with severe pneumonia. Our conclusion is as follows: (1) Compared with midazolam, the comprehensive effect of dexmedetomidine on children with severe pneumonia undergoing tracheal intubation for anesthesia and sedation is better, it can effectively shorten the anesthesia induction time and the recovery time after stopping the drug, and there are few adverse reactions, which is worthy of application and promotion. (2) UEX is an important risk factor in the monitoring and nursing of children with severe pneumonia tracheal intubation, and the nursing method of PDCA cycle management is particularly important for them.

Question: Given [Male genital lichen planus: A retrospective study of 89 cases. Background: Unlike other types of lichen planus (LP), there are no series concerning male genital LP. Objective: To describe the clinical characteristics, diagnosis, and response to treatment of male genital LP. Patients and methods: A retrospective study of male patients with genital LP consulting a dermatologist specialized in anogenital diseases between January 2010 and 2019. Demographic data, history, functional signs, clinical characteristics, pathology, complications, and treatment efficacy were collected. Results: Eighty-nine patients were included at four centers. The median age was 51 years. Most patients were uncircumcised and asymptomatic. In 88.8% of cases, only the genital mucosa was involved. Erythema (71%), papules (21.3%), lacy network (15.7%), atrophic lesions (15.7%), erosions (14.6%), and post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation (2.2%) were less frequently observed. Biopsy results confirmed LP in 61.3% of cases but could not rule out other inflammatory genital dermatoses in other cases. Anatomic complications were observed in 30.3% of patients. Topical corticosteroids (TCS) induced remission in most cases. Tacrolimus efficacy was comparable to that of TCS.

Question: Given [Pharmacological inhibition of Ref-1 enhances the therapeutic sensitivity of papillary thyroid carcinoma to vemurafenib. The use of the BRAF inhibitor vemurafenib exhibits drug resistance in the treatment of thyroid cancer (TC), and finding more effective multitarget combination therapies may be an important solution. In the present study, we found strong correlations between Ref-1 high expression and BRAF mutation, lymph node metastasis, and TNM stage. The oxidative stress environment induced by structural activation of BRAF upregulates the expression of Ref-1, which caused intrinsic resistance of PTC to vemurafenib. Combination inhibition of the Ref-1 redox function and BRAF could enhance the antitumor effects of vemurafenib, which was achieved by blocking the action of Ref-1 on BRAF proteins. Furthermore, combination treatment could cause an overload of autophagic flux via excessive AMPK protein activation, causing cell senescence and cell death in vitro. And combined administration of Ref-1 and vemurafenib in vivo suppressed PTC cell growth and metastasis in a cell-based lung metastatic tumor model and xenogeneic subcutaneous tumor model. Collectively, our study provides evidence that Ref-1 upregulation via constitutive activation of BRAF in PTC contributes to intrinsic resistance to vemurafenib.

Question: Given [Anti-CCR4 treatment depletes regulatory T cells and leads to clinical activity in a canine model of advanced prostate cancer. Background Targeting regulatory T cell (Treg) infiltration is an emerging strategy for cancer immunotherapy. However, its efficacy in advanced prostate cancer remains unclear. Here, we showed the therapeutic efficacy of anti-Treg treatment in a canine model of advanced prostate cancer. Methods We used dogs with naturally occurring prostate cancer to study the molecular mechanism underlying Treg infiltration and the effect of anti-Treg treatment. Tumor-infiltrating Tregs was evaluated by immunohistochemistry, and the association with prognosis was examined in dogs with spontaneous prostate cancer. The molecular mechanism of Treg infiltration was explored by RNA sequencing and protein analyses. A non-randomized canine clinical trial was conducted to define the therapeutic potential of anti-Treg treatment for advanced prostate cancer. Human prostate cancer datasets were analyzed to compare gene expression in dogs and humans. Results Tumor-infiltrating Tregs were associated with poor prognosis in dogs bearing spontaneous prostate cancer. RNA sequencing and protein analyses showed a possible link between the CCL17-CCR4 pathway and the increase of tumor-infiltrating Tregs. Dogs with advanced prostate cancer responded to mogamulizumab, a monoclonal antibody targeting CCR4, with decreased circulating Tregs, improved survival, and low incidence of clinically relevant adverse events. Urinary CCL17 concentration and BRAF V595E mutation were independently predictive of the response to mogamulizumab. Analysis of a transcriptomic dataset of human prostate cancer showed that the CCL17-CCR4 axis correlated with Foxp3. In silico survival analyses revealed that high expression of CCL17 was associated with poor prognosis. Immunohistochemistry confirmed that tumor-infiltrating Tregs expressed CCR4 in human patients with prostate cancer. Conclusions Anti-Treg treatment, through CCR4 blockade, may be a promising therapeutic approach for advanced prostate cancer in dogs and some population of human patients.

Considering the effective noncovalent interactions in the subtype-D2 receptor selectivity of antipsychotics, this study evaluated the possible physicochemical properties of ligands underlying the design of safer and more effective antipsychotics.

Question: Given [Docking Screens of Noncovalent Interaction Motifs of the Human Subtype-D2 Receptor-75 Schizophrenia Antipsychotic Complexes with Physicochemical Appraisal of Antipsychotics. Chemoinformatics appraisal and molecular docking were employed to investigate 225 complexes of 75 schizophrenia antipsychotics with the dopamine receptor subtypes D2R, D3R, and D4R. Considering the effective noncovalent interactions in the subtype-D2 receptor selectivity of antipsychotics, this study evaluated the possible physicochemical properties of ligands underlying the design of safer and more effective antipsychotics. The pan-Assay interference compounds (PAINs) include about 25% of typical antipsychotics and 5% of atypicals. Popular antipsychotics like haloperidol, clozapine, risperidone, and aripiprazole are not PAINs. They have stronger interactions with D2R and D4R, but their interactions with D3R are slightly weaker, which is similar to the behavior of dopamine. In contrast to typical antipsychotics, atypical antipsychotics exhibit more noncovalent interactions with D4R than with D2R. These results suggest that selectivity to D2R and D4R comes from the synergy between hydrophobic and hydrogen-bonding interactions through their concomitant occurrence in the form of a hydrogen-bonding site adorned with hydrophobic contacts in antipsychotic-receptor complexes. All the antipsychotics had more synergic interactions with D2R and D4R in comparison with D3R. The atypical antipsychotics made a good distinction between the subtype D2 receptors with high selectivity to D4R. Among the popular antipsychotics, haloperidol, clozapine, and risperidone have hydrophobic-hydrogen-bonding synergy with D4R, while aripiprazole profits with D2R. The most important residue participating in the synergic interactions was threonine for D2R and cysteine for D4R. This work could be useful in informing and guiding future drug discovery and development studies aimed at receptor-specific antipsychotics.] you can imply that [Schizophrenia antipsychotics are more selective towards dopamine receptor subtype D3R.].

Question: Given [Antidiarrheal Effect of 80% Methanol Extract and Fractions of Clerodendrum myricoides (Hochst.) Vatke (Lamiaceae) Leaf in Swiss Albino Mice. Background. Diarrhea is one of the tempting symptoms of diseases in the world. In Ethiopian traditional medicine practices, Clerodendrum myricoides is utilized for the treatment of diarrhea without scientific evidence. Objective. This study was aimed to evaluate the antidiarrheal activity of 80% methanol extract and fractions of the leaf of Clerodendrum myricoides in mice. Methods. The crude extract was prepared by maceration in 80% methanol and then fractionated using hexane, chloroform, and distilled water. Antidiarrheal activity was assessed by castor oil-induced diarrhea, enteropooling, and gastrointestinal motility models using onset of diarrhea, number and weight of feces, volume and weight of intestinal contents, and distance travelled by charcoal meal as main parameters. Negative controls received either distilled water or 2% Tween 80 (10 ml/kg), positive controls received 3 mg/kg loperamide or 1 mg/kg atropine, and the test groups received 100, 200, and 400 mg/kg doses of the extract. Results. The crude extract and chloroform fraction significantly prolonged the onset of diarrhea at 200 and 400 mg/kg and decreased the number of wet, total, and weight of fresh feces at all tested doses. Hexane fraction has a significant antidiarrheal effect on the onset, number, and weight of feces at 400 mg/kg. The crude extract and chloroform fraction at all tested doses, as well as aqueous fraction at 200 mg/kg and 100 mg/kg, produced significant reduction in volume and weight of intestinal contents. Additionally, hexane fraction showed significant reduction of volume and weight of the intestinal content at 400 mg/kg. In the gastrointestinal motility test model, both chloroform fraction and crude extract at all tested doses and aqueous fraction at 200 mg/kg and 400 mg/kg showed a significant antidiarrheal effect as compared to the negative control. Conclusion. The leaf of Clerodendrum myricoides showed antidiarrheal activity which supports the traditional use.] you can imply that [80% methanol has an antidiarrheal effect.].

Question: Given [Protective efficacy of the peptide Subolesin antigen against the cattle tick Rhipicephalus microplus under natural infestation. The cattle tick Rhipicephalus microplus affect animal health, welfare, and cattle production in tropical and subtropical zones of the world. Anti-tick vaccines have been an effective alternative for cattle tick control instead of traditional chemical products. To date, Subolesin antigen has shown efficacy for the control of tick infestation in cattle, and previous studies showed that one peptide derived from this protein has demonstrated to elicit a strong and specific humoral immune response. Based on these findings, herein we characterized the efficacy of the peptide Subolesin for the control of cattle tick, R. microplus infestation under field conditions. Twenty-four female calves were assigned to four experimental groups and immunized with three subcutaneous doses of the peptide Subolesin, Bm86, both antigens (dual vaccine) and adjuvant/saline alone, respectively. Serum antibody levels (IgG) were assessed by ELISA and confirmed by Western blot; also, reproductive performance of naturally infested R. microplus was determined. The results showed that immunizations with the experimental antigens reduced tick infestations with vaccine's efficacy of 67 % (peptide Subolesin), 56 % (Bm86), and 49 % (dual vaccine) based on adult tick numbers, oviposition, and egg fertility between vaccinated and control animals. Peptide Subolesin-immunized calves developed a strong humoral immune response expressed by high anti-pSubolesin IgG levels, and the Western blot analysis confirmed that it is immunogenic. Cattle receiving Bm86 and dual vaccine showed less protection, although Bm86 was within the range reported previously. The negative correlation between antibody levels and reduction of naturally infested R. microplus strongly suggested that the effect of the vaccine was the result of the antibody response in immunized cattle. In conclusion, it was demonstrated that the peptide Subolesin induced a specific immune response in cattle under field conditions, resulting in reduced R. microplus populations in subsequent generations.

Introduction: Nilotinib, as the second generation of tyrosine kinase inhibitor, has significant efficacy in patients with chronic myeloid leukemia resistant or intolerant to Imatinib. Aplastic anemia induced by tyrosine kinase inhibitors is an uncommon complication. Case report: A 34-year-old female case with CML in the chronic phase was treated with Imatinib in first-line therapy.

Question: Given [Apremilast Prolongs the Time to First Biologic Therapy in Japanese Patients with Psoriasis. Introduction: Biologic agents are used in patients with severe psoriasis who have not adequately responded to existing conventional systemic therapies. However, only a limited number of medical institutions in Japan are approved to use them, and their relatively high cost represents a substantial burden to patients. Apremilast is an oral phosphodiesterase-4 inhibitor approved in Japan for the treatment of psoriasis vulgaris in adult patients with an inadequate response to topical therapies and psoriatic arthritis in adult patients with active disease. To date, a large-scale real-world study of treatment patterns and costs associated with apremilast in Japan has not been conducted. The objective of this study was to assess whether apremilast can prolong time to first biologic therapy use and decrease total medical cost. Methods: Using the Medical Data Vision hospital-based claims database, 506 psoriasis patients were propensity score matched and analyzed (apremilast: n = 253; non-apremilast: n = 253). Results: The incidence rate of first biologic therapy use per 1000 patient-years was significantly lower in the apremilast group than in the non-apremilast group (30.3 vs. 107.6; P < 0.001), and the total medical costs per month were significantly lower in the apremilast group than in the non-apremilast group (76,594 yen/month vs. 102,411 yen/month, P < 0.001). In a sensitivity analysis of a propensity-score-matched subset of eligible patients prescribed biologics during the follow-up period (apremilast: n = 14; non-apremilast: n = 14), the incidence of first biologic therapy use was 2,797.6 per 1000 patient-years (95% CI: 1,656.9, 4,723.6) in the non-apremilast group and 856.1 per 1000 patient-years (95% CI: 507.0, 1,445.5) in the apremilast group. Conclusion: These results suggest that apremilast prolongs the time to first biologic therapy use in patients with psoriasis, thereby reducing the total medical cost and decreasing the economic burden on patients.] you can assume that [Apremilast can reduce total medical costs per month compared to the non-apremilast group in Japanese patients with psoriasis.].

Question: Given [A Multimetric Evaluation of Online Patient Educational Materials for Breast Implant-associated Anaplastic Large Cell Lymphoma. Objective: To assess understandability, actionability, and readability of online patient educational materials (OPEM) related to breast implant-associated anaplastic large cell lymphoma (BIA-ALCL). Methods: Search volumes for query terms related to BIA-ALCL including "breast implant associated lymphoma,""breast implant associated anaplastic large cell lymphoma,"and "BIA-ALCL"were analyzed in one-week increments and normalized to total Google search volume. The same terms were then queried using an online search engine to identify commonly accessed OPEM on this topic. Understandability and actionability of OPEM were evaluated using the Patient Education Materials Assessment Tool. Grade-level readability was determined using generalized estimating equations, with observations nested within readability metrics from each website. All interval estimates were calculated for 95% confidence. Results: Overall, 24 websites were identified based on search parameters. Of these websites, 11 (45.8%) met criteria for understandability, and 1 (4.2%) met criteria for actionability. Overall, readability ranged from 10.2 to 17.3 for all websites with an average grade level readability of 12.4; 0 websites were written at or below a sixth-grade reading level. Government websites had the highest average grade reading level at 14.0, followed by commercial websites at 13.2, nonprofit websites at 12.0, and then academic/hospital-based websites at 11.5. Conclusion: The quality of available OPEM on BIA-ALCL is limited. Future development of OPEM should be designed with the goal of improving both comprehension and actionability to help reduce patient anxiety and unnecessary clinical appointments related to this disease.

Question: Given [Apremilast Prolongs the Time to First Biologic Therapy in Japanese Patients with Psoriasis. Introduction: Biologic agents are used in patients with severe psoriasis who have not adequately responded to existing conventional systemic therapies. However, only a limited number of medical institutions in Japan are approved to use them, and their relatively high cost represents a substantial burden to patients. Apremilast is an oral phosphodiesterase-4 inhibitor approved in Japan for the treatment of psoriasis vulgaris in adult patients with an inadequate response to topical therapies and psoriatic arthritis in adult patients with active disease. To date, a large-scale real-world study of treatment patterns and costs associated with apremilast in Japan has not been conducted. The objective of this study was to assess whether apremilast can prolong time to first biologic therapy use and decrease total medical cost. Methods: Using the Medical Data Vision hospital-based claims database, 506 psoriasis patients were propensity score matched and analyzed (apremilast: n = 253; non-apremilast: n = 253). Results: The incidence rate of first biologic therapy use per 1000 patient-years was significantly lower in the apremilast group than in the non-apremilast group (30.3 vs. 107.6; P < 0.001), and the total medical costs per month were significantly lower in the apremilast group than in the non-apremilast group (76,594 yen/month vs. 102,411 yen/month, P < 0.001). In a sensitivity analysis of a propensity-score-matched subset of eligible patients prescribed biologics during the follow-up period (apremilast: n = 14; non-apremilast: n = 14), the incidence of first biologic therapy use was 2,797.6 per 1000 patient-years (95% CI: 1,656.9, 4,723.6) in the non-apremilast group and 856.1 per 1000 patient-years (95% CI: 507.0, 1,445.5) in the apremilast group. Conclusion: These results suggest that apremilast prolongs the time to first biologic therapy use in patients with psoriasis, thereby reducing the total medical cost and decreasing the economic burden on patients.] you can imply that [Apremilast can reduce total medical costs per month compared to the non-apremilast group in Japanese patients with psoriasis.].

Question: Given [Association of Systolic Blood Pressure With Dementia Risk and the Role of Age, U-Shaped Associations, and Mortality. Importance: The optimal systolic blood pressure (SBP) to minimize the risk of dementia in older age is unknown. Objective: To investigate whether the association between SBP and dementia risk is U-shaped and whether age and comorbidity play a role in this association. Design, Setting, and Participants: This cohort study used an individual participant data approach to analyze 7 prospective, observational, population-based cohort studies that were designed to evaluate incident dementia in older adults. These studies started between 1987 and 2006 in Europe and the US. Participants had no dementia diagnosis and had SBP and/or diastolic blood pressure (BP) data at baseline and incident dementia status during follow-up. Data analysis was conducted from November 7, 2019, to October 3, 2021. Exposures: Baseline systolic BP. Main Outcomes and Measures: All-cause dementia (defined using Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders [Third Edition Revised] or Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders [Fourth Edition] and established at follow-up measurements or in clinical practice), mortality, and combined dementia and mortality were the outcomes. Covariates included baseline antihypertensive medication use, sex, educational level, body mass index, smoking status, diabetes, stroke history, myocardial infarction history, and polypharmacy. Cox proportional hazards regression models were used, and nonlinear associations were explored using natural splines. Results: The study analyzed 7 cohort studies with a total of 17286 participants, among whom 10393 were women (60.1%) and the mean (SD) baseline age was 74.5 (7.3) years. Overall, dementia risk was lower for individuals with higher SBP, with the lowest risk associated with an SBP of approximately 185 mm Hg (95% CI, 161-230 mm Hg; P =.001). Stratified by overlapping 10-year baseline age groups, the lowest dementia risk was observed at somewhat lower systolic BP levels in those older than 75 years (158 [95% CI, 152-178] mm Hg to 170 [95% CI, 160-260] mm Hg). For mortality, there was a clear U-shaped association, with the lowest risk at 160 mm Hg (95% CI, 154-181 mm Hg; P <.001). This U-shape occurred across all age groups, with the lowest dementia risk associated with an SBP of 134 mm Hg (95% CI, 102-149 mm Hg; P =.03) in those aged 60 to 70 years and increasing to between 155 mm Hg (95% CI, 150-166 mm Hg; P <.001) and 166 mm Hg (95% CI, 154-260 mm Hg; P =.02) for age groups between 70 and 95 years. Combined dementia and mortality risk curves closely resembled those for mortality. Associations of diastolic BP with dementia risk were generally similar but were less distinct. Conclusions and Relevance: This cohort study found that dementia risk was lower for older individuals with higher SBP levels and that more distinctly U-shaped associations appeared for those older than 75 years, but these associations cannot be explained by SBP-associated changes in mortality risk. The findings may warrant future trials on tailored BP management in older age groups that take life expectancy and health context into consideration.

Question: Given [Assessment of risk factors and pregnancy outcomes in women with thrombotic microangiopathy in Ain Shams University Maternity Hospital over a 5-year period. Thrombotic microangiopathy in pregnancy can lead to maternal and fetal life-threatening adverse events. Objective. To study the demographic characteristics (age, parity), risk factors, treatment modalities, and pregnancy outcomes in women with thrombotic microangiopathy in Ain Shams University Maternity Hospital over a 5-year period. Patients and methods. This study was retrospectively conducted at Ain Shams University Maternity Hospital and included 419 patients; the study population were pregnant women admitted to the hospital from January 2014 to December 2018, with pregnancy-associated thrombotic microangiopathy. The study was performed through revising the medical records in the archive and the ICU and contacting the patients to assess demographic data, risk factors, presentation of the patient, type of the syndrome, and the maternal and fetal outcome. Results. HELLP syndrome was the most common pregnancy complication. In most of cases, women delivered by cesarean section (72.1%). Complications included chronic hypertension (CHTN), acute kidney injury (AKI), chronic kidney injury (CKI). Maternal mortality was significantly more frequent in hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS). Maternal mortality was 8.8 %, and neonatal mortality was 26.7%. Most of women were admitted to the ICU (87.1%). Conclusion. Thrombotic microangiopathy in pregnancy continues to pose a large challenge to obstetricians, immunologists, and nephrologists due to potential risks and complications. Pregnancy outcome is more optimistic when termination of pregnancy occurs early in the disease with the possible use of corticosteroids with or without plasma exchange transfusion under the control of a multidisciplinary approach team.] you can assume that [Pregnancy-associated thrombotic microangiopathy poses a risk for neonatal mortality.].

Question: Given [International Society for the Study of Women's Sexual Health Clinical Practice Guideline for the Use of Systemic Testosterone for Hypoactive Sexual Desire Disorder in Women. Aim: To provide a clinical practice guideline for the use of testosterone including identification of patients, laboratory testing, dosing, post-treatment monitoring, and follow-up care in women with hypoactive sexual desire disorder (HSDD). Methods: The International Society for the Study of Women's Sexual Health appointed a multidisciplinary panel of experts who performed a literature review of original research, meta-analyses, review papers, and consensus guidelines regarding testosterone use in women. Consensus was reached using a modified Delphi method. Outcomes: A clinically useful guideline following a biopsychosocial assessment and treatment approach for the safe and efficacious use of testosterone in women with HSDD was developed including measurement, indications, formulations, prescribing, dosing, monitoring, and follow-up. Results: Although the Global Position Statement endorses testosterone therapy for only postmenopausal women, limited data also support the use in late reproductive age premenopausal women, consistent with the International Society for the Study of Women's Sexual Health Process of Care for the Management of HSDD. Systemic transdermal testosterone is recommended for women with HSDD not primarily related to modifiable factors or comorbidities such as relationship or mental health problems. Current available research supports a moderate therapeutic benefit. Safety data show no serious adverse events with physiologic testosterone use, but long-term safety has not been established. Before initiation of therapy, clinicians should provide an informed consent. Shared decision-making involves a comprehensive discussion of off-label use, as well as benefits and risks. A total testosterone level should not be used to diagnose HSDD, but as a baseline for monitoring. Government-approved transdermal male formulations can be used cautiously with dosing appropriate for women. Patients should be assessed for signs of androgen excess and total testosterone levels monitored to maintain concentrations in the physiologic premenopausal range. Compounded products cannot be recommended because of the lack of efficacy and safety data. Clinical implications: This clinical practice guideline provides standards for safely prescribing testosterone to women with HSDD, including identification of appropriate patients, dosing, and monitoring. Strengths and limitations: This evidence-based guideline builds on a recently published comprehensive meta-analysis and the Global Position Statement endorsed by numerous societies. The limitation is that testosterone therapy is not approved for women by most regulatory agencies, thereby making prescribing and proper dosing challenging. Conclusion: Despite substantial evidence regarding safety, efficacy, and clinical use, access to testosterone therapy for the treatment of HSDD in women remains a significant unmet need.] you can assume that [Systemic transdermal testosterone is effective in women with hypoactive sexual desire disorder.].

Question: Given [Association Between Immune Dysfunction and COVID-19 Breakthrough Infection After SARS-CoV-2 Vaccination in the US. Importance: Persons with immune dysfunction have a higher risk for severe COVID-19 outcomes. However, these patients were largely excluded from SARS-CoV-2 vaccine clinical trials, creating a large evidence gap. Objective: To identify the incidence rate and incidence rate ratio (IRR) for COVID-19 breakthrough infection after SARS-CoV-2 vaccination among persons with or without immune dysfunction. Design, Setting, and Participants: This retrospective cohort study analyzed data from the National COVID Cohort Collaborative (N3C), a partnership that developed a secure, centralized electronic medical record-based repository of COVID-19 clinical data from academic medical centers across the US. Persons who received at least 1 dose of a SARS-CoV-2 vaccine between December 10, 2020, and September 16, 2021, were included in the sample. Main Outcomes and Measures: Vaccination, COVID-19 diagnosis, immune dysfunction diagnoses (ie, HIV infection, multiple sclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis, solid organ transplant, and bone marrow transplantation), other comorbid conditions, and demographic data were accessed through the N3C Data Enclave. Breakthrough infection was defined as a COVID-19 infection that was contracted on or after the 14th day of vaccination, and the risk after full or partial vaccination was assessed for patients with or without immune dysfunction using Poisson regression with robust SEs. Poisson regression models were controlled for a study period (before or after [pre- or post-Delta variant] June 20, 2021), full vaccination status, COVID-19 infection before vaccination, demographic characteristics, geographic location, and comorbidity burden. Results: A total of 664722 patients in the N3C sample were included. These patients had a median (IQR) age of 51 (34-66) years and were predominantly women (n = 378307 [56.9%]). Overall, the incidence rate for COVID-19 breakthrough infection was 5.0 per 1000 person-months among fully vaccinated persons but was higher after the Delta variant became the dominant SARS-CoV-2 strain (incidence rate before vs after June 20, 2021, 2.2 [95% CI, 2.2-2.2] vs 7.3 [95% CI, 7.3-7.4] per 1000 person-months). Compared with partial vaccination, full vaccination was associated with a 28% reduced risk for breakthrough infection (adjusted IRR [AIRR], 0.72; 95% CI, 0.68-0.76). People with a breakthrough infection after full vaccination were more likely to be older and women. People with HIV infection (AIRR, 1.33; 95% CI, 1.18-1.49), rheumatoid arthritis (AIRR, 1.20; 95% CI, 1.09-1.32), and solid organ transplant (AIRR, 2.16; 95% CI, 1.96-2.38) had a higher rate of breakthrough infection. Conclusions and Relevance: This cohort study found that full vaccination was associated with reduced risk of COVID-19 breakthrough infection, regardless of the immune status of patients. Despite full vaccination, persons with immune dysfunction had substantially higher risk for COVID-19 breakthrough infection than those without such a condition. For persons with immune dysfunction, continued use of nonpharmaceutical interventions (eg, mask wearing) and alternative vaccine strategies (eg, additional doses or immunogenicity testing) are recommended even after full vaccination.

Question: Given [International Society for the Study of Women's Sexual Health Clinical Practice Guideline for the Use of Systemic Testosterone for Hypoactive Sexual Desire Disorder in Women. Aim: To provide a clinical practice guideline for the use of testosterone including identification of patients, laboratory testing, dosing, post-treatment monitoring, and follow-up care in women with hypoactive sexual desire disorder (HSDD). Methods: The International Society for the Study of Women's Sexual Health appointed a multidisciplinary panel of experts who performed a literature review of original research, meta-analyses, review papers, and consensus guidelines regarding testosterone use in women. Consensus was reached using a modified Delphi method. Outcomes: A clinically useful guideline following a biopsychosocial assessment and treatment approach for the safe and efficacious use of testosterone in women with HSDD was developed including measurement, indications, formulations, prescribing, dosing, monitoring, and follow-up. Results: Although the Global Position Statement endorses testosterone therapy for only postmenopausal women, limited data also support the use in late reproductive age premenopausal women, consistent with the International Society for the Study of Women's Sexual Health Process of Care for the Management of HSDD. Systemic transdermal testosterone is recommended for women with HSDD not primarily related to modifiable factors or comorbidities such as relationship or mental health problems. Current available research supports a moderate therapeutic benefit. Safety data show no serious adverse events with physiologic testosterone use, but long-term safety has not been established. Before initiation of therapy, clinicians should provide an informed consent. Shared decision-making involves a comprehensive discussion of off-label use, as well as benefits and risks. A total testosterone level should not be used to diagnose HSDD, but as a baseline for monitoring. Government-approved transdermal male formulations can be used cautiously with dosing appropriate for women. Patients should be assessed for signs of androgen excess and total testosterone levels monitored to maintain concentrations in the physiologic premenopausal range. Compounded products cannot be recommended because of the lack of efficacy and safety data. Clinical implications: This clinical practice guideline provides standards for safely prescribing testosterone to women with HSDD, including identification of appropriate patients, dosing, and monitoring. Strengths and limitations: This evidence-based guideline builds on a recently published comprehensive meta-analysis and the Global Position Statement endorsed by numerous societies. The limitation is that testosterone therapy is not approved for women by most regulatory agencies, thereby making prescribing and proper dosing challenging. Conclusion: Despite substantial evidence regarding safety, efficacy, and clinical use, access to testosterone therapy for the treatment of HSDD in women remains a significant unmet need.] you can imply that [Systemic transdermal testosterone is effective in women with hypoactive sexual desire disorder.].

Question: Given [Association Between Immune Dysfunction and COVID-19 Breakthrough Infection After SARS-CoV-2 Vaccination in the US. Importance: Persons with immune dysfunction have a higher risk for severe COVID-19 outcomes. However, these patients were largely excluded from SARS-CoV-2 vaccine clinical trials, creating a large evidence gap. Objective: To identify the incidence rate and incidence rate ratio (IRR) for COVID-19 breakthrough infection after SARS-CoV-2 vaccination among persons with or without immune dysfunction. Design, Setting, and Participants: This retrospective cohort study analyzed data from the National COVID Cohort Collaborative (N3C), a partnership that developed a secure, centralized electronic medical record-based repository of COVID-19 clinical data from academic medical centers across the US. Persons who received at least 1 dose of a SARS-CoV-2 vaccine between December 10, 2020, and September 16, 2021, were included in the sample. Main Outcomes and Measures: Vaccination, COVID-19 diagnosis, immune dysfunction diagnoses (ie, HIV infection, multiple sclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis, solid organ transplant, and bone marrow transplantation), other comorbid conditions, and demographic data were accessed through the N3C Data Enclave. Breakthrough infection was defined as a COVID-19 infection that was contracted on or after the 14th day of vaccination, and the risk after full or partial vaccination was assessed for patients with or without immune dysfunction using Poisson regression with robust SEs. Poisson regression models were controlled for a study period (before or after [pre- or post-Delta variant] June 20, 2021), full vaccination status, COVID-19 infection before vaccination, demographic characteristics, geographic location, and comorbidity burden. Results: A total of 664722 patients in the N3C sample were included. These patients had a median (IQR) age of 51 (34-66) years and were predominantly women (n = 378307 [56.9%]). Overall, the incidence rate for COVID-19 breakthrough infection was 5.0 per 1000 person-months among fully vaccinated persons but was higher after the Delta variant became the dominant SARS-CoV-2 strain (incidence rate before vs after June 20, 2021, 2.2 [95% CI, 2.2-2.2] vs 7.3 [95% CI, 7.3-7.4] per 1000 person-months). Compared with partial vaccination, full vaccination was associated with a 28% reduced risk for breakthrough infection (adjusted IRR [AIRR], 0.72; 95% CI, 0.68-0.76). People with a breakthrough infection after full vaccination were more likely to be older and women. People with HIV infection (AIRR, 1.33; 95% CI, 1.18-1.49), rheumatoid arthritis (AIRR, 1.20; 95% CI, 1.09-1.32), and solid organ transplant (AIRR, 2.16; 95% CI, 1.96-2.38) had a higher rate of breakthrough infection. Conclusions and Relevance: This cohort study found that full vaccination was associated with reduced risk of COVID-19 breakthrough infection, regardless of the immune status of patients. Despite full vaccination, persons with immune dysfunction had substantially higher risk for COVID-19 breakthrough infection than those without such a condition. For persons with immune dysfunction, continued use of nonpharmaceutical interventions (eg, mask wearing) and alternative vaccine strategies (eg, additional doses or immunogenicity testing) are recommended even after full vaccination.

Question: Given [Sitagliptin and Narrow-Band Ultraviolet-B for Moderate Psoriasis (DINUP): A Randomised Controlled Clinical Trial. Background: Sitagliptin, a dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitor licensed for the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), has been reported to improve psoriasis. Objective: We compared the effects of sitagliptin treatment, a DPP-4 inhibitor, in combination with narrow-band ultraviolet-B (NB-UVB) phototherapy compared to NB-UVB alone on psoriasis severity, quality of life, cardiovascular disease risk factors and immune parameters in people with moderate psoriasis without T2DM. Methods: In this 39-week, single-centre, randomised controlled trial, people were allocated randomly to receive sitagliptin for 24 weeks with NB-UVB or NB-UVB alone. The primary endpoint was the change in Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) from baseline to 24 weeks. We estimated that 120 participants would be needed to have 80% power to find a significant difference between the groups. Results: A total of 118 patients were randomised. The median (IQR) baseline PASI was 8.8 (7.5-11.6). At 24 weeks, the mean difference from baseline in PASI (-1.0 [95% CI-2.0 to 0.0]) was significantly larger in the sitagliptin/NB-UVB arm than in the NB-UVB-alone arm (p = 0.044). There were significant differences in the change in Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (-2.5 [95% CI-4.0 to-1.0]; p = 0.002) and EuroQol 5-item questionnaire (0.1 [95% CI 0.0-0.1]; p = 0.036) values from baseline to 24 weeks between the sitagliptin/NB-UVB and the NB-UVB-alone arm. There were no treatment-related serious adverse events. Conclusion: Sitagliptin therapy combined with NB-UVB phototherapy significantly improved psoriasis severity, albeit modestly, compared to NB-UVB phototherapy alone in patients with moderate psoriasis without T2DM.

Question: Given [Association between Pentosan Polysulfate Sodium and Retinal Disorders. Importance: Case series have identified a macular condition hypothesized to be associated with the use of pentosan polysulfate sodium (PPS). Observational studies seeking to quantify this association have yielded equivocal results. Objective: To estimate the association between PPS exposure and maculopathy. Design, Setting, and Participants: This disproportionality analysis was conducted using the US Food and Drug Administration Adverse Event Reporting System from January 2013 through June 2020. Exposure: Adverse event reports for pentosan polysulfate were selected and compared with adverse event reports associated with drugs taken for the following indications: interstitial cystitis, cystitis, bladder disorder, or bladder pain. Main Outcome Measures: Retinal adverse events were identified using the retinal disorders Standardized Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) Query, which includes conditions associated with retinal damage attributable to blockage of its blood supply, nutritional deficiencies, toxins, and diseases affecting the retina. Results: There were 2775 reports available for analysis in the PPS group (of which 1966 were for women [70.9%]) and 6833 reports in the other drugs group (of which 4036 [59.1%] were for women). The proportion of adverse events for any macular event relative to all other events was elevated for the users of PPS compared with those using other interstitial cystitis and bladder pain drugs (proportionate reporting ratio [PRR], 1.21 [95% CI, 1.01-1.44]). With respect to specific retinal conditions, macular degeneration (20 [0.8%] vs 15 [0.2%]), maculopathy (83 [3.4%] vs 2 [0.03%]), retinal dystrophy (3 [0.1%] vs 0), retinal injury (5 [0.2%] vs 0), and retinal toxicity (3 [0.1%] vs 0) were proportionately more common among users of PPS compared with those using other interstitial cystitis and bladder pain drugs, respectively.

Identification of primary tumors and metastasis sites is an essential step in cancer diagnostics and the following treatment. Positron emission tomography-computed tomography (PET/CT) is one of the most reliable methods for scanning the whole organism for malignancies. In this work, we synthesized an 11C-labeled oligonucleotide primer and hybridized it to an anti-cancer DNA aptamer. The 11C-aptamer was applied for in vivo imaging of Ehrlich ascites carcinoma and its metastases in mice using PET/CT. The imaging experiments with the 11C-aptamer determined very small primary and secondary tumors of 3 mm2 and less. We also compared 11C imaging with the standard radiotracer, 2-deoxy-2-[fluorine-18]fluoro-D-glucose (18F-FDG), and found better selectivity of the 11C-aptamer to metastatic lesions in the metabolically active organs than 18F-FDG. 11C radionuclide with an ultra-short (20.38 min) half-life is considered safest for PET/CT imaging and does not cause false-positive results in heart imaging. Its combination with aptamers gives us high-specificity and high-contrast imaging of cancer cells and can be applied for PET/CT-guided drug delivery in cancer therapies.] you can assume that [11C-radiolabeled aptamer is better than 18F-FDG for imaging tumors and metastases using positron emission tomography-computed tomography.].

Question: Given [Association of Human Milk Antibody Induction, Persistence, and Neutralizing Capacity with SARS-CoV-2 Infection vs mRNA Vaccination. Importance: Long-term effect of parental COVID-19 infection vs vaccination on human milk antibody composition and functional activity remains unclear. Objective: To compare temporal IgA and IgG response in human milk and microneutralization activity against SARS-CoV-2 between lactating parents with infection and vaccinated lactating parents out to 90 days after infection or vaccination. Design, Setting, and Participants: Convenience sampling observational cohort (recruited July to December 2020) of lactating parents with infection with human milk samples collected at days 0 (within 14 days of diagnosis), 3, 7, 10, 28, and 90. The observational cohort included vaccinated lactating parents with human milk collected prevaccination, 18 days after the first dose, and 18 and 90 days after the second dose. Exposures: COVID-19 infection diagnosed by polymerase chain reaction within 14 days of consent or receipt of messenger RNA (mRNA) COVID-19 vaccine (BNT162b2 or mRNA-1273). Main Outcomes and Measures: Human milk anti-SARS-CoV-2 receptor-binding domain IgA and IgG and microneutralization activity against live SARS-CoV-2 virus. Results: Of 77 individuals, 47 (61.0%) were in the infection group (mean [SD] age, 29.9 [4.4] years), and 30 (39.0%) were in the vaccinated group (mean [SD] age, 33.0 [3.4] years; P =.002). The mean (SD) age of infants in the infection and vaccinated group were 3.1 (2.2) months and 7.5 (5.2) months, respectively (P <.001). Infection was associated with a variable human milk IgA and IgG receptor-binding domain-specific antibody response over time that was classified into different temporal patterns: upward trend and level trend (33 of 45 participants [73%]) and low/no response (12 of 45 participants [27%]). Infection was associated with a robust and quick IgA response in human milk that was stable out to 90 days after diagnosis. Vaccination was associated with a more uniform IgG-dominant response with concentrations increasing after each vaccine dose and beginning to decline by 90 days after the second dose. Vaccination was associated with increased human milk IgA after the first dose only (mean [SD] increase, 31.5 [32.6] antibody units). Human milk collected after infection and vaccination exhibited microneutralization activity. Microneutralization activity increased throughout time in the vaccine group only (median [IQR], 2.2 [0] before vaccine vs 10 [4.0] after the first dose; P =.003) but was higher in the infection group (median [IQR], 20 [67] at day 28) vs the vaccination group after the first-dose human milk samples (P =.002). Both IgA and non-IgA (IgG-containing) fractions of human milk from both participants with infection and those who were vaccinated exhibited microneutralization activity against SARS-CoV-2. Conclusions and Relevance: In this cohort study of a convenience sample of lactating parents, the pattern of IgA and IgG antibodies in human milk differed between COVID-19 infection vs mRNA vaccination out to 90 days.

Question: Given [11C-radiolabeled aptamer for imaging of tumors and metastases using positron emission tomography- computed tomography. Identification of primary tumors and metastasis sites is an essential step in cancer diagnostics and the following treatment. Positron emission tomography-computed tomography (PET/CT) is one of the most reliable methods for scanning the whole organism for malignancies. In this work, we synthesized an 11C-labeled oligonucleotide primer and hybridized it to an anti-cancer DNA aptamer. The 11C-aptamer was applied for in vivo imaging of Ehrlich ascites carcinoma and its metastases in mice using PET/CT. The imaging experiments with the 11C-aptamer determined very small primary and secondary tumors of 3 mm2 and less. We also compared 11C imaging with the standard radiotracer, 2-deoxy-2-[fluorine-18]fluoro-D-glucose (18F-FDG), and found better selectivity of the 11C-aptamer to metastatic lesions in the metabolically active organs than 18F-FDG. 11C radionuclide with an ultra-short (20.38 min) half-life is considered safest for PET/CT imaging and does not cause false-positive results in heart imaging. Its combination with aptamers gives us high-specificity and high-contrast imaging of cancer cells and can be applied for PET/CT-guided drug delivery in cancer therapies.] you can imply that [11C-radiolabeled aptamer is better than 18F-FDG for imaging tumors and metastases using positron emission tomography-computed tomography.].

Question: Given [Association of Human Milk Antibody Induction, Persistence, and Neutralizing Capacity with SARS-CoV-2 Infection vs mRNA Vaccination. Importance: Long-term effect of parental COVID-19 infection vs vaccination on human milk antibody composition and functional activity remains unclear. Objective: To compare temporal IgA and IgG response in human milk and microneutralization activity against SARS-CoV-2 between lactating parents with infection and vaccinated lactating parents out to 90 days after infection or vaccination. Design, Setting, and Participants: Convenience sampling observational cohort (recruited July to December 2020) of lactating parents with infection with human milk samples collected at days 0 (within 14 days of diagnosis), 3, 7, 10, 28, and 90. The observational cohort included vaccinated lactating parents with human milk collected prevaccination, 18 days after the first dose, and 18 and 90 days after the second dose. Exposures: COVID-19 infection diagnosed by polymerase chain reaction within 14 days of consent or receipt of messenger RNA (mRNA) COVID-19 vaccine (BNT162b2 or mRNA-1273). Main Outcomes and Measures: Human milk anti-SARS-CoV-2 receptor-binding domain IgA and IgG and microneutralization activity against live SARS-CoV-2 virus. Results: Of 77 individuals, 47 (61.0%) were in the infection group (mean [SD] age, 29.9 [4.4] years), and 30 (39.0%) were in the vaccinated group (mean [SD] age, 33.0 [3.4] years; P =.002). The mean (SD) age of infants in the infection and vaccinated group were 3.1 (2.2) months and 7.5 (5.2) months, respectively (P <.001). Infection was associated with a variable human milk IgA and IgG receptor-binding domain-specific antibody response over time that was classified into different temporal patterns: upward trend and level trend (33 of 45 participants [73%]) and low/no response (12 of 45 participants [27%]). Infection was associated with a robust and quick IgA response in human milk that was stable out to 90 days after diagnosis. Vaccination was associated with a more uniform IgG-dominant response with concentrations increasing after each vaccine dose and beginning to decline by 90 days after the second dose. Vaccination was associated with increased human milk IgA after the first dose only (mean [SD] increase, 31.5 [32.6] antibody units). Human milk collected after infection and vaccination exhibited microneutralization activity. Microneutralization activity increased throughout time in the vaccine group only (median [IQR], 2.2 [0] before vaccine vs 10 [4.0] after the first dose; P =.003) but was higher in the infection group (median [IQR], 20 [67] at day 28) vs the vaccination group after the first-dose human milk samples (P =.002). Both IgA and non-IgA (IgG-containing) fractions of human milk from both participants with infection and those who were vaccinated exhibited microneutralization activity against SARS-CoV-2. Conclusions and Relevance: In this cohort study of a convenience sample of lactating parents, the pattern of IgA and IgG antibodies in human milk differed between COVID-19 infection vs mRNA vaccination out to 90 days. While infection was associated with a highly variable IgA-dominant response and vaccination was associated with an IgG-dominant response, both were associated with having human milk that exhibited neutralization activity against live SARS-CoV-2 virus..] you can imply that [Human milk after COVID-19 infection or mRNA vaccination exhibited neutralization activity against the live SARS-CoV-2 virus.].

Question: Given [Serous macular detachments associated with topical travoprost. Here is presented a unique case of bilateral serous macular detachments as a side effect of topical travoprost (0.004%) therapy. Only three other cases in the literature have definitively associated this side effect with other topical prostaglandins. The aetiological and pathophysiological pathways remain to be clearly elucidated but are potentially related to increased choroidal vascular permeability. In this case, the subretinal fluid resolved rapidly and completely after cessation of travoprost drops, showing it to be a reversible pathology similar to prostaglandin-associated cystoid macular oedema. This uncommon association is therefore important to consider in the differential diagnosis of serous macular detachment. Increasing ophthalmic awareness could help to prevent unnecessary investigations in undifferentiated patients without other guiding historical or examination features. This may save time and expense for the patient and health systems.

Question: Given [Association of Preeclampsia and Perinatal Complications with Offspring Neurodevelopmental and Psychiatric Disorders. Importance: Maternal preeclampsia has been reported to increase the risk of autism spectrum disorder, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), and intellectual disability in offspring. However, the association between maternal preeclampsia combined with perinatal complications and neurodevelopmental and psychiatric disorders in offspring is less well documented. Objective: To examine the association of maternal preeclampsia, separately and together with perinatal complications, with neurodevelopmental and psychiatric disorders in offspring. Design, Setting, and Participants: This population-based cohort study used data from nationwide registries in Finland to assess all singleton live births (N = 1 012 723) between January 1, 1996, and December 31, 2014. Offspring were followed up until December 31, 2018 (when the oldest reached age 22 years). Exclusion criteria were maternal inpatient psychiatric diagnoses and pregestational diabetes. The study and data analysis were conducted from May 1, 2020, to June 1, 2021. Exposures: Preeclampsia and perinatal complications (delivery earlier than 34 weeks' gestation and/or small for gestational age). Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary outcomes were neurodevelopmental and psychiatric diagnoses and dispensation of psychotropic drugs among offspring until December 31, 2018. Cox proportional hazards regression analyses were performed to assess the associations. Results: Of 1 012 723 singleton live births (51.1% boys; mean [SD] maternal age at birth, 30.0 [5.4] years; specific data on race and ethnicity were not available in the data set), 21 010 children (2.1%) were exposed to preeclampsia alone, 33 625 children (3.3%) were exposed to perinatal complications alone, and 4891 children (0.5%) were exposed to both preeclampsia and perinatal complications. A total of 93 281 children (9.2%) were diagnosed with a neurodevelopmental or psychiatric disorder. Offspring exposed to both preeclampsia and perinatal complications had an increased risk of any neurodevelopmental or psychiatric disorder after adjusting for potential confounding (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR], 2.11; 95% CI, 1.96-2.26) compared with those not exposed to either preeclampsia or perinatal complications; this risk was higher than exposure to either preeclampsia alone (aHR, 1.18; 95% CI, 1.12-1.23) or perinatal complications alone (aHR, 1.77; 95% CI, 1.72-1.82). Sibling pair analyses did not detect any increase in the risk of neurodevelopmental or psychiatric disorders after exposure to preeclampsia alone, but offspring exposed to both preeclampsia and perinatal complications had increased risks of intellectual disabilities (aHR, 3.24; 95% CI, 1.05-10.06), specific developmental disorders (aHR, 3.56; 95% CI, 2.35-5.41), ADHD and conduct disorders (aHR, 2.42; 95% CI, 1.09-5.39), and other behavioral and emotional disorders (aHR, 2.45; 95% CI, 1.17-5.13).

Question: Given [Outcomes of patients with oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma treated with induction chemotherapy followed by concurrent chemoradiation compared with those treated with concurrent chemoradiation. Background: Induction chemotherapy (IC) has been associated with a decreased risk of distant metastasis in locally advanced head and neck squamous cell carcinoma. However, its role in the treatment of oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (OPSCC) is not well established. Methods: The outcomes of patients with OPSCC treated with IC followed by concurrent chemoradiation (CRT) were compared with the outcomes of those treated with CRT alone. The primary outcome was overall survival (OS), and the secondary end points were the times to locoregional and distant recurrence. Results: In an existing database, 585 patients met the inclusion criteria: 137 received IC plus CRT, and 448 received CRT. Most patients were positive for human papillomavirus (HPV; 90.9%). Patients receiving IC were more likely to present with a higher T stage, a higher N stage, and low neck disease. The 3-year OS rate was significantly lower in patients receiving IC (75.7%) versus CRT alone (92.9%). In a multicovariate analysis, receipt of IC (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR], 3.4; P <.001), HPV tumor status (aHR, 0.36; P =.002), and receipt of concurrent cetuximab (aHR, 2.7; P =.002) were independently associated with OS. The risk of distant metastasis was also significantly higher in IC patients (aHR, 2.8; P =.001), whereas an HPV-positive tumor status (aHR, 0.44; P =.032) and completion of therapy (aHR, 0.51; P =.034) were associated with a lower risk of distant metastasis. In HPV-positive patients, IC remained associated with distant metastatic progression (aHR, 2.6; P =.004) but not OS. Conclusions: In contrast to prior studies, IC was independently associated with worse OS and a higher risk of distant metastasis in patients with OPSCC.

Question: Given [Association of Systolic Blood Pressure With Dementia Risk and the Role of Age, U-Shaped Associations, and Mortality. Importance: The optimal systolic blood pressure (SBP) to minimize the risk of dementia in older age is unknown. Objective: To investigate whether the association between SBP and dementia risk is U-shaped and whether age and comorbidity play a role in this association. Design, Setting, and Participants: This cohort study used an individual participant data approach to analyze 7 prospective, observational, population-based cohort studies that were designed to evaluate incident dementia in older adults. These studies started between 1987 and 2006 in Europe and the US. Participants had no dementia diagnosis and had SBP and/or diastolic blood pressure (BP) data at baseline and incident dementia status during follow-up. Data analysis was conducted from November 7, 2019, to October 3, 2021. Exposures: Baseline systolic BP. Main Outcomes and Measures: All-cause dementia (defined using Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders [Third Edition Revised] or Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders [Fourth Edition] and established at follow-up measurements or in clinical practice), mortality, and combined dementia and mortality were the outcomes. Covariates included baseline antihypertensive medication use, sex, educational level, body mass index, smoking status, diabetes, stroke history, myocardial infarction history, and polypharmacy. Cox proportional hazards regression models were used, and nonlinear associations were explored using natural splines. Results: The study analyzed 7 cohort studies with a total of 17286 participants, among whom 10393 were women (60.1%) and the mean (SD) baseline age was 74.5 (7.3) years. Overall, dementia risk was lower for individuals with higher SBP, with the lowest risk associated with an SBP of approximately 185 mm Hg (95% CI, 161-230 mm Hg; P =.001). Stratified by overlapping 10-year baseline age groups, the lowest dementia risk was observed at somewhat lower systolic BP levels in those older than 75 years (158 [95% CI, 152-178] mm Hg to 170 [95% CI, 160-260] mm Hg). For mortality, there was a clear U-shaped association, with the lowest risk at 160 mm Hg (95% CI, 154-181 mm Hg; P <.001). This U-shape occurred across all age groups, with the lowest dementia risk associated with an SBP of 134 mm Hg (95% CI, 102-149 mm Hg; P =.03) in those aged 60 to 70 years and increasing to between 155 mm Hg (95% CI, 150-166 mm Hg; P <.001) and 166 mm Hg (95% CI, 154-260 mm Hg; P =.02) for age groups between 70 and 95 years. Combined dementia and mortality risk curves closely resembled those for mortality. Associations of diastolic BP with dementia risk were generally similar but were less distinct. Conclusions and Relevance: This cohort study found that dementia risk was lower for older individuals with higher SBP levels and that more distinctly U-shaped associations appeared for those older than 75 years, but these associations cannot be explained by SBP-associated changes in mortality risk. The findings may warrant future trials on tailored BP management in older age groups that take life expectancy and health context into consideration.

For mortality, there was a clear U-shaped association, with the lowest risk at 160 mm Hg (95% CI, 154-181 mm Hg; P <.001). This U-shape occurred across all age groups, with the lowest dementia risk associated with an SBP of 134 mm Hg (95% CI, 102-149 mm Hg; P =.03) in those aged 60 to 70 years and increasing to between 155 mm Hg (95% CI, 150-166 mm Hg; P <.001) and 166 mm Hg (95% CI, 154-260 mm Hg; P =.02) for age groups between 70 and 95 years. Combined dementia and mortality risk curves closely resembled those for mortality. Associations of diastolic BP with dementia risk were generally similar but were less distinct. Conclusions and Relevance: This cohort study found that dementia risk was lower for older individuals with higher SBP levels and that more distinctly U-shaped associations appeared for those older than 75 years, but these associations cannot be explained by SBP-associated changes in mortality risk. The findings may warrant future trials on tailored BP management in older age groups that take life expectancy and health context into consideration.

Question: Given [Outcomes of patients with oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma treated with induction chemotherapy followed by concurrent chemoradiation compared with those treated with concurrent chemoradiation. Background: Induction chemotherapy (IC) has been associated with a decreased risk of distant metastasis in locally advanced head and neck squamous cell carcinoma. However, its role in the treatment of oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (OPSCC) is not well established. Methods: The outcomes of patients with OPSCC treated with IC followed by concurrent chemoradiation (CRT) were compared with the outcomes of those treated with CRT alone. The primary outcome was overall survival (OS), and the secondary end points were the times to locoregional and distant recurrence. Results: In an existing database, 585 patients met the inclusion criteria: 137 received IC plus CRT, and 448 received CRT. Most patients were positive for human papillomavirus (HPV; 90.9%). Patients receiving IC were more likely to present with a higher T stage, a higher N stage, and low neck disease. The 3-year OS rate was significantly lower in patients receiving IC (75.7%) versus CRT alone (92.9%). In a multicovariate analysis, receipt of IC (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR], 3.4; P <.001), HPV tumor status (aHR, 0.36; P =.002), and receipt of concurrent cetuximab (aHR, 2.7; P =.002) were independently associated with OS. The risk of distant metastasis was also significantly higher in IC patients (aHR, 2.8; P =.001), whereas an HPV-positive tumor status (aHR, 0.44; P =.032) and completion of therapy (aHR, 0.51; P =.034) were associated with a lower risk of distant metastasis. In HPV-positive patients, IC remained associated with distant metastatic progression (aHR, 2.6; P =.004) but not OS. Conclusions: In contrast to prior studies, IC was independently associated with worse OS and a higher risk of distant metastasis in patients with OPSCC. Future studies are needed to validate these findings.] you can imply that [Oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma treatment with induction chemotherapy followed by concurrent chemoradiation is better than concurrent chemoradiation alone.].

Question: Given [Association of Systolic Blood Pressure With Dementia Risk and the Role of Age, U-Shaped Associations, and Mortality. Importance: The optimal systolic blood pressure (SBP) to minimize the risk of dementia in older age is unknown. Objective: To investigate whether the association between SBP and dementia risk is U-shaped and whether age and comorbidity play a role in this association. Design, Setting, and Participants: This cohort study used an individual participant data approach to analyze 7 prospective, observational, population-based cohort studies that were designed to evaluate incident dementia in older adults. These studies started between 1987 and 2006 in Europe and the US. Participants had no dementia diagnosis and had SBP and/or diastolic blood pressure (BP) data at baseline and incident dementia status during follow-up. Data analysis was conducted from November 7, 2019, to October 3, 2021. Exposures: Baseline systolic BP. Main Outcomes and Measures: All-cause dementia (defined using Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders [Third Edition Revised] or Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders [Fourth Edition] and established at follow-up measurements or in clinical practice), mortality, and combined dementia and mortality were the outcomes. Covariates included baseline antihypertensive medication use, sex, educational level, body mass index, smoking status, diabetes, stroke history, myocardial infarction history, and polypharmacy. Cox proportional hazards regression models were used, and nonlinear associations were explored using natural splines. Results: The study analyzed 7 cohort studies with a total of 17286 participants, among whom 10393 were women (60.1%) and the mean (SD) baseline age was 74.5 (7.3) years. Overall, dementia risk was lower for individuals with higher SBP, with the lowest risk associated with an SBP of approximately 185 mm Hg (95% CI, 161-230 mm Hg; P =.001). Stratified by overlapping 10-year baseline age groups, the lowest dementia risk was observed at somewhat lower systolic BP levels in those older than 75 years (158 [95% CI, 152-178] mm Hg to 170 [95% CI, 160-260] mm Hg). For mortality, there was a clear U-shaped association, with the lowest risk at 160 mm Hg (95% CI, 154-181 mm Hg; P <.001). This U-shape occurred across all age groups, with the lowest dementia risk associated with an SBP of 134 mm Hg (95% CI, 102-149 mm Hg; P =.03) in those aged 60 to 70 years and increasing to between 155 mm Hg (95% CI, 150-166 mm Hg; P <.001) and 166 mm Hg (95% CI, 154-260 mm Hg; P =.02) for age groups between 70 and 95 years.

Question: Given [Gomisin M2 alleviates psoriasis-like skin inflammation by inhibiting inflammatory signaling pathways. Psoriasis, a chronic inflammatory skin disease, is characterized by the excessive proliferation and impaired differentiation of epidermal keratinocytes and is accompanied by the increased infiltration of inflammatory cells. The condition requires long-term treatment and has no definitive cure. Hence, supplements and therapeutic agents have been intensely investigated. Gomisin M2 (GM2), a lignan extracted from Schisandra chinensis (Turcz). Baill. (Schisandraceae; S. chinensis), has demonstrated diverse pharmacological properties, including anticancer, anti-inflammatory and antiallergic effects. Based on these findings, the present study examined the effects of GM2 on an imiquimod (IMQ)-induced psoriasis mouse model and on keratinocytes stimulated by tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-a and interferon-?. IMQ was topically applied to the back skin of mice for 7 consecutive days, and the mice were orally administered CD. These results showed that the oral administration of GM2 suppressed the symptoms of psoriasis, as evidenced by reductions in skin thickness, psoriasis area severity index scores for psoriasis lesions, transepidermal water loss and myeloperoxidase (MPO)-associated cell infiltration. Furthermore, GM2 reduced the pathologically increased levels of immunoglobulin G2a, MPO and TNF-a in the serum and T helper (Th)1 and Th17 cell populations in the spleen. GM2 decreased the gene expression of inflammatory-related cytokines and chemokines and inhibited the expression of signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 and nuclear factor-?B in the activated keratinocytes.

Question: Given [BOND study: A randomised double-blind, placebo-controlled trial over 12 months to assess the effects of benfotiamine on morphometric, neurophysiological and clinical measures in patients with type 2 diabetes with symptomatic polyneuropathy. Introduction Diabetic sensorimotor polyneuropathy (DSPN) affects approximately 30% of people with diabetes, while around half of cases are symptomatic. Currently, there are only few pathogenetically oriented pharmacotherapies for DSPN, one of which is benfotiamine, a prodrug of thiamine with a high bioavailability and favourable safety profile. While benfotiamine has shown positive effects in preclinical and short-term clinical studies, no long-term clinical trials are available to demonstrate disease-modifying effects on DSPN using a comprehensive set of disease-related endpoints. Methods and analysis The benfotiamine on morphometric, neurophysiological and clinical measures in patients with type 2 diabetes trial is a randomised double-blind, placebo-controlled parallel group monocentric phase II clinical trial to assess the effects of treatment with benfotiamine compared with placebo in participants with type 2 diabetes and mild to moderate symptomatic DSPN. Sixty participants will be 1:1 randomised to treatment with benfotiamine 300 mg or placebo two times a day over 12 months. The primary endpoint will be the change in corneal nerve fibre length assessed by corneal confocal microscopy (CCM) after 12 months of benfotiamine treatment compared with placebo. Secondary endpoints will include other CCM measures, skin biopsy and function indices, variables from somatic and autonomic nerve function tests, clinical examination and questionnaires, general health, health-related quality of life, cost, safety and blood tests. Ethics and dissemination The trial was approved by the competent authority and the local independent ethics committee. Trial results will be published in peer-reviewed journals, conference abstracts, and via online and print media. Trial registration number DRKS00014832.

Question: Given [Baclofen-induced neurotoxicity in chronic kidney disease: Is there a safe dose?. Most cases of Baclofen toxicity have been reported in patients with impaired kidney functions, within a few days to weeks after ingestion. We report three cases of Baclofen induced encephalopathy in chronic kidney disease patients; two developed encephalopathy within 6-8 h after ingestion of a single tablet and third on 4 th day of consuming 2.5 mg twice daily dose. All three cases recovered fully following haemodialysis treatment.

Question: Given [Advancement of PI3 Kinase Inhibitor Combination Therapies for PI3K-Aberrant Chordoma. Objectives Targeted inhibitors of the PI3 kinase (PI3K) pathway have shown promising but incomplete antitumor activity in preclinical chordoma models. The aim of this study is to advance methodology for a high-throughput drug screen using chordoma models to identify new combination therapies for chordoma. Study Design Present work is an in vitro study. Setting The study conducted at an academic research laboratory. Materials and Methods An in vitro study on automated high-throughput screening of chordoma cells was performed using a library of 1,406 drugs as both mono- and combination therapies with PI3K inhibitors. Combination indices were determined for dual therapies and synergistic outliers were identified as potential therapeutic agents. T (brachyury) siRNA knockdown in combination with PI3K pathway inhibition was also assessed. Results Fifty-nine combination therapies were identified as having potential therapeutic efficacy. Effective combinations included PI3K inhibitors with GSK1838705A (ALK/IGF-1R inhibitor), LY2874455 (VEGFR/FGFR inhibitor), El1 (selective Ezh2 inhibitor), and (-)-p-bromotetramisole oxalate (alkaline phosphatase inhibitor). The top ranking targets identified included ALK, PDGFR, VEGFR, aurora kinase, and BCL-2. T (brachyury) inhibition produced significant reduction in cell viability and growth; however PI3K inhibition in combination with T (brachyury) knockdown did not result in further reduction in growth and viability in vitro. Conclusion High throughput with in vitro combination screening is feasible with chordoma cells and allows for rapid identification of synergistic dual-therapies.

Question: Given [Baicalin suppresses the progression of Type 2 diabetes-induced liver tumor through regulating METTL3/m6A/HKDC1 axis and downstream p-JAK2/STAT1/clevaged Capase3 pathway. Background: Epidemiological and clinical evidence suggests that diabetes increases the risk of liver cancer. Although the co-occurrence of type 2 diabetes (T2D) and liver cancer is becoming more frequent, the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Even though baicalin, extensively used in traditional Chinese medicine (TCM), can control T2D and inhibit liver cancer separately, minimal research is available regarding its possible effect on T2D-induced liver cancer. Thus, in the present study, we aimed to investigate the role of baicalin in T2D-induced hepatocellular cancer, and for the first time, we particularly emphasized the regulation of baicalin in genes RNA m6A in hepatocellular cancer. Methods: Here, we constructed a cell culture model under a high concentration of glucose and a T2D-induced liver tumor model to evaluate the in vitro and in vivo role of baicalin in T2D-induced liver cancer progression. After confirming the suppressive effect of baicalin and the HKDC1 antibody on T2D-induced liver tumors, the epigenetic alterations (DNA 5mC and RNA m6A) of the baicalin-regulated HKDC1 gene were detected using MS and q-PCR. Next, the METTL3 gene-regulated m6A (2854 site) was investigated using SELECT PCR. Finally, the impact of the other three baicalin analogs (baicalein, wogonoside, and wogonin) on tumor inhibition was tested in vivo while verifying the related RNA m6A mechanism. Results: The results showed that baicalin and the HKDC1 antibody suppressed T2D-induced liver tumor progression in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, baicalin significantly inhibited the epigenetic modification (DNA 5mC and RNA m6A) of HKDC1 in HepG2 tumors, mainly targeting the RNA m6A site (2854). The m6A-related gene, METTL3, regulated the RNA m6A site (2854) of HKDC1, which was also restricted by baicalin. Moreover, the study verified that baicalin regulated the METTL3/HKDC1/JAK2/STAT1/caspase-3 pathway in liver cancer cells when exposed to a high glucose concentration. In addition, the three baicalin analogs were proven to regulate the m6A (2854 site) of HKDC1 and suppress T2D-induced liver tumors. Conclusions: The findings of this study revealed that baicalin suppressed T2D-induced liver tumor progression by regulating the METTL3/m6A/HKDC1 axis, which might support its potential application for preventing and treating T2D-induced liver cancer.] you can assume that [Baicalin, extensively used in traditional Chinese medicine, can suppress type 2 diabetes-induced liver tumor progression by regulating the METTL3/m6A/HKDC1 axis.].

Question: Given [Clustering and Erratic Movement Patterns of Syringe-Injected versus Mosquito-Inoculated Malaria Sporozoites Underlie Decreased Infectivity. Malaria vaccine candidates based on live, attenuated sporozoites have led to high levels of protection. However, their efficacy critically depends on the sporozoites' ability to reach and infect the host liver. Administration via mosquito inoculation is by far the most potent method for inducing immunity but highly impractical. Here, we observed that intradermal syringe-injected Plasmodium berghei sporozoites (syrSPZ) were 3-fold less efficient in migrating to and infecting mouse liver than mosquito-inoculated sporozoites (msqSPZ). This was related to a clustered dermal distribution (2-fold-decreased median distance between syrSPZ and msqSPZ) and, more importantly, a 1.4-fold (significantly)-slower and more erratic movement pattern. These erratic movement patterns were likely caused by alteration of dermal tissue morphology (.15-mm intercellular gaps) due to injection of fluid and may critically decrease sporozoite infectivity. These results suggest that novel microvolume-based administration technologies hold promise for replicating the success of mosquito-inoculated live, attenuated sporozoite vaccines. IMPORTANCE Malaria still causes a major burden on global health and the economy. The efficacy of live, attenuated malaria sporozoites as vaccine candidates critically depends on their ability to migrate to and infect the host liver. This work sheds light on the effect of different administration routes on sporozoite migration. We show that the delivery of sporozoites via mosquito inoculation is more efficient than syringe injection; however, this route of administration is highly impractical for vaccine purposes. Using confocal microscopy and automated imaging software, we demonstrate that syringe-injected sporozoites do cluster, move more slowly, and display more erratic movement due to alterations in tissue morphology.

Backgrounds: Berberine (BBR), a compound long used in traditional Chinese medicine, has been reported to have therapeutic effects in treating ulcerative colitis (UC), attributed to its anti-inflammatory properties and restorative potential of tight junctions (TJs). However, the mechanism by which BBR affects intestinal bacteria and immunity is still unclear. Methods: This study investigated the effects of BBR on intestinal bacteria and the inflammatory response in dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced colitis mice. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) and electron microscopy were used to detect intestinal TJs. Microflora analysis was used to screen for bacteria regulated by BBR. Results: The results showed that BBR had increased colonic epithelium zonula occludens proteins-1 (ZO-1) and occludin expression and reduced T-helper 17/T regulatory ratio in DSS-induced mice. Mechanically, BBR eliminated DSS-induced intestinal flora disturbances in mice, particularly increased Bacteroides fragilis (B. fragilis) in vivo and in vitro. B. fragilis decreased the interleukin-6 induced by dendritic cells through some heat-resistant component rather than nucleic acids or proteins. Conclusions: Overall, these data suggest that BBR had a moderating effect on DSS-induced colitis.

Question: Given [Berberine inhibits dendritic cells differentiation in DSS-induced colitis by promoting Bacteroides fragilis. Backgrounds: Berberine (BBR), a compound long used in traditional Chinese medicine, has been reported to have therapeutic effects in treating ulcerative colitis (UC), attributed to its anti-inflammatory properties and restorative potential of tight junctions (TJs). However, the mechanism by which BBR affects intestinal bacteria and immunity is still unclear. Methods: This study investigated the effects of BBR on intestinal bacteria and the inflammatory response in dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced colitis mice. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) and electron microscopy were used to detect intestinal TJs. Microflora analysis was used to screen for bacteria regulated by BBR. Results: The results showed that BBR had increased colonic epithelium zonula occludens proteins-1 (ZO-1) and occludin expression and reduced T-helper 17/T regulatory ratio in DSS-induced mice. Mechanically, BBR eliminated DSS-induced intestinal flora disturbances in mice, particularly increased Bacteroides fragilis (B. fragilis) in vivo and in vitro.

Question: Given [Costs of care for low-energy extremity gunshot injuries are reduced with standardized treatment. Objectives: (1) To determine the overall treatment costs associated with isolated low-energy gunshot wounds (GSWs) to the extremity and (2) to estimate cost savings associated with a single-dose IV antibiotic strategy administered in the emergency room for patients with simple GSWs. Design: Retrospective review. Setting: Level I trauma center. Patients/Participants: Patients (N = 380) with extremity-only GSW injuries from 2010 to 2015 were retrospectively reviewed. Treatment was recorded including type and duration of antibiotics, admission, and surgical intervention. Main Outcome Measures: Costs were calculated including facility services in the operating room and hospital. Results: There were 460 GSWs in 380 patients with a mean age of 30 years old. There were 309 admissions, 273 operations performed, and 1010 days of antibiotics prescribed. The total inpatient facility cost to treat all patients was $1,701,154. Among 179 patients who could be treated by the single-dose antibiotic care pathway for simple GSWs, 132 patients (73%) received additional treatment with 108 hospital admissions, 26 debridement surgeries, and 322 days of additional oral and/or IV antibiotics. The single-dose antibiotic care pathway would have saved an average of $1436 per patient with simple GSWs in actual facility expenses. Conclusions: The overall cost associated with isolated low-energy GSWs to the extremity is high. Limiting antibiotics to a single IV dose in the emergency room can reduce treatment expenses substantially for patients with simple GSWs.

Question: Given [Beyond depression, antidepressants to treat chronic pain. Antidepressants were originally designed and marketed to treat depression and anxiety disorders, but they are also an off-label option that should be considered by clinicians in specialties other than psychiatry, particularly for the treatment of chronic pain. Chronic pain is considered one of the most costly and disabling medical conditions. There are many different treatment options available for patients that suffer from chronic pain, ranging from pharmacological therapy to surgical interventions. Antidepressants are used to treat a variety of chronic pain conditions including peripheral neuropathy, headache, and more recently, fibromyalgia. In this regard, recent studies have proven their effectiveness, and given further understanding of their mechanisms, drug-drug interactions, and adverse effects. The first antidepressants to have been used in this indication are the tricyclic antidepressants. They remain benchmark products, even though newer antidepressants, such as serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors, venlafaxine, milnacipran and duloxetine, or other atypical antidepressants, such as bupropion, are increasingly used, in part because of their better tolerability. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, on the other hand, appear to have no analgesic effects. Prescription of antidepressants offers an alternative and adjunct therapeutic option for patients with chronic pain of various modalities. It is also hoped that treating chronic pain with antidepressants could lead to a decrease in the use of opioid analgesics and also improve many of the concurrent psychiatric conditions associated with chronic pain.

Background: There is a growing need for information regarding the recent coronavirus disease of 2019 (COVID-19). We present a comprehensive report of COVID-19 patients in Iran. Materials and Methods: One hundred hospitalized patients with COVID-19 were studied. Data on potential source of exposure, demographic, clinical, and paraclinical features, therapy outcome, and postdischarge follow-up were analyzed. Results: The median age of the patients was 58 years, and the majority of the patients (72.7%) were above 50 years of age. Fever was present in 45.2% of the patients on admission. The most common clinical symptoms were shortness of breath (74%) and cough (68%). Most patients had elevated C-reactive protein (92.3%), elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate (82.9%), and lymphocytopenia (74.2%) on admission. Lower lobes of the lung were most commonly involved, and ground-glass opacity (81.8%) was the most frequent finding in computed tomography scans.

Question: Given [Bisphosphonate use does not impact survival in patients with pancreatic cancer: A propensity score matching analysis. Background/Aims: Bisphosphonates are increasingly recognized for their anti-neoplastic properties, which are the result of their action on the mevalonate pathway. Our primary aim was to investigate the association between bisphosphonate use and survival in patients with pancreatic cancer. Since statins also act on the mevalonate pathway, we also investigated the effect of the combined use of bisphosphonates and statins on survival. Methods: The Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results registry (SEER)-Medicare linked database was used to identify patients with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) between 2007 and 2015. Kaplan-Meier models were used to examine the association between survival with bisphosphonate use alone and in combination with statins within 1 year prior to the diagnosis of PDAC. Propensity score matching analysis and Cox-proportional hazard models were used to determine the association between overall survival with bisphosphonate use alone and combined with statins, after adjusting for relevant confounders, such as the Charlson comorbidity index score, stage, treatment, sociodemographic characteristics, and propensity score. Results: In total, 13,639 patients with PDAC were identified, and 1,203 (8.82%) used bisphosphonates. There was no difference in the mean survival duration between bisphosphonate users (7.27 months) and nonusers (7.25 months, p=0.61). After adjustment for confounders, bisphosphonate use was still not associated with improved survival (hazard ratio, 1.00; 95% confidence interval, 0.93 to 1.08; p=0.96). Combined bisphosphonate and statin use was also not associated with improved survival (hazard ratio, 0.97; 95% confidence interval, 0.87 to 1.07; p=0.48) after adjustment for confounders. Conclusions: Our findings suggest that the use of bisphosphonates, whether alone or in combination with statins, does not confer a survival advantage in patients with PDAC.] you can assume that [Combined bisphosphonate and statin use is associated with improved survival in patients with pancreatic cancer.].

Question: Given [Bisphosphonate use does not impact survival in patients with pancreatic cancer: A propensity score matching analysis. Background/Aims: Bisphosphonates are increasingly recognized for their anti-neoplastic properties, which are the result of their action on the mevalonate pathway. Our primary aim was to investigate the association between bisphosphonate use and survival in patients with pancreatic cancer. Since statins also act on the mevalonate pathway, we also investigated the effect of the combined use of bisphosphonates and statins on survival. Methods: The Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results registry (SEER)-Medicare linked database was used to identify patients with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) between 2007 and 2015. Kaplan-Meier models were used to examine the association between survival with bisphosphonate use alone and in combination with statins within 1 year prior to the diagnosis of PDAC. Propensity score matching analysis and Cox-proportional hazard models were used to determine the association between overall survival with bisphosphonate use alone and combined with statins, after adjusting for relevant confounders, such as the Charlson comorbidity index score, stage, treatment, sociodemographic characteristics, and propensity score. Results: In total, 13,639 patients with PDAC were identified, and 1,203 (8.82%) used bisphosphonates. There was no difference in the mean survival duration between bisphosphonate users (7.27 months) and nonusers (7.25 months, p=0.61). After adjustment for confounders, bisphosphonate use was still not associated with improved survival (hazard ratio, 1.00; 95% confidence interval, 0.93 to 1.08; p=0.96). Combined bisphosphonate and statin use was also not associated with improved survival (hazard ratio, 0.97; 95% confidence interval, 0.87 to 1.07; p=0.48) after adjustment for confounders. Conclusions: Our findings suggest that the use of bisphosphonates, whether alone or in combination with statins, does not confer a survival advantage in patients with PDAC.] you can infer that [Combined bisphosphonate and statin use is associated with improved survival in patients with pancreatic cancer.].

Question: Given [COVID-19, An early investigation from exposure to treatment outcomes in Tehran, Iran. Background: There is a growing need for information regarding the recent coronavirus disease of 2019 (COVID-19). We present a comprehensive report of COVID-19 patients in Iran. Materials and Methods: One hundred hospitalized patients with COVID-19 were studied. Data on potential source of exposure, demographic, clinical, and paraclinical features, therapy outcome, and postdischarge follow-up were analyzed. Results: The median age of the patients was 58 years, and the majority of the patients (72.7%) were above 50 years of age. Fever was present in 45.2% of the patients on admission. The most common clinical symptoms were shortness of breath (74%) and cough (68%). Most patients had elevated C-reactive protein (92.3%), elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate (82.9%), and lymphocytopenia (74.2%) on admission. Lower lobes of the lung were most commonly involved, and ground-glass opacity (81.8%) was the most frequent finding in computed tomography scans. The administration of hydroxychloroquine improved the clinical outcome of the patients. Lopinavir/ritonavir was efficacious at younger ages. Of the 70 discharged patients, 40% had symptom aggravation, 8.6% were readmitted to the hospital, and three patients (4.3%) died.

Question: Given [Association of Preeclampsia and Perinatal Complications with Offspring Neurodevelopmental and Psychiatric Disorders. Importance: Maternal preeclampsia has been reported to increase the risk of autism spectrum disorder, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), and intellectual disability in offspring. However, the association between maternal preeclampsia combined with perinatal complications and neurodevelopmental and psychiatric disorders in offspring is less well documented. Objective: To examine the association of maternal preeclampsia, separately and together with perinatal complications, with neurodevelopmental and psychiatric disorders in offspring. Design, Setting, and Participants: This population-based cohort study used data from nationwide registries in Finland to assess all singleton live births (N = 1 012 723) between January 1, 1996, and December 31, 2014. Offspring were followed up until December 31, 2018 (when the oldest reached age 22 years). Exclusion criteria were maternal inpatient psychiatric diagnoses and pregestational diabetes. The study and data analysis were conducted from May 1, 2020, to June 1, 2021. Exposures: Preeclampsia and perinatal complications (delivery earlier than 34 weeks' gestation and/or small for gestational age). Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary outcomes were neurodevelopmental and psychiatric diagnoses and dispensation of psychotropic drugs among offspring until December 31, 2018. Cox proportional hazards regression analyses were performed to assess the associations. Results: Of 1 012 723 singleton live births (51.1% boys; mean [SD] maternal age at birth, 30.0 [5.4] years; specific data on race and ethnicity were not available in the data set), 21 010 children (2.1%) were exposed to preeclampsia alone, 33 625 children (3.3%) were exposed to perinatal complications alone, and 4891 children (0.5%) were exposed to both preeclampsia and perinatal complications. A total of 93 281 children (9.2%) were diagnosed with a neurodevelopmental or psychiatric disorder. Offspring exposed to both preeclampsia and perinatal complications had an increased risk of any neurodevelopmental or psychiatric disorder after adjusting for potential confounding (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR], 2.11; 95% CI, 1.96-2.26) compared with those not exposed to either preeclampsia or perinatal complications; this risk was higher than exposure to either preeclampsia alone (aHR, 1.18; 95% CI, 1.12-1.23) or perinatal complications alone (aHR, 1.77; 95% CI, 1.72-1.82). Sibling pair analyses did not detect any increase in the risk of neurodevelopmental or psychiatric disorders after exposure to preeclampsia alone, but offspring exposed to both preeclampsia and perinatal complications had increased risks of intellectual disabilities (aHR, 3.24; 95% CI, 1.05-10.06), specific developmental disorders (aHR, 3.56; 95% CI, 2.35-5.41), ADHD and conduct disorders (aHR, 2.42; 95% CI, 1.09-5.39), and other behavioral and emotional disorders (aHR, 2.45; 95% CI, 1.17-5.13). The risk estimates for specific developmental disorders (aHR, 2.82; 95% CI, 2.60-3.05) and ADHD and conduct disorders (aHR, 1.88; 95% CI, 1.65-2.14) were higher among offspring exposed to both preeclampsia and perinatal complications compared with those exposed to perinatal complications alone (aHR, 2.26 [95% CI, 2.18-2.33] and 1.60 [95% CI, 1.52-1.68], respectively). Conclusions and Relevance: In this study, exposure to both maternal preeclampsia and perinatal complications was associated with intellectual disabilities, specific developmental disorders, ADHD and conduct disorders, and other behavioral and emotional disorders in offspring. For specific developmental disorders and ADHD and conduct disorders, the risk estimates were higher among offspring exposed to both preeclampsia and perinatal complications compared with those exposed to perinatal complications only.] you can assume that [Exposure to both maternal preeclampsia and perinatal complications is not associated with intellectual disabilities, specific developmental disorders, ADHD, conduct disorders, or other behavioral and emotional disorders in offspring.].

Question: Given [Blinatumomab-related pneumatosis intestinalis in a pediatric patient with relapsed acute lymphoblastic leukemia: A case report. Introduction: Pneumatosis intestinalis is characterized by air in the subserosal or submucosal layer of the intestine, with the severity ranging from mild and asymptomatic to symptomatic with serious conditions such as intestinal ischemia and perforation requiring surgery. Although several etiologies, including those from conventional chemotherapy agents and molecular target agents, have been suggested, blinatumomab-related pneumatosis intestinalis is quite rare. Case report: An 11-year-old girl with history of B-cell ALL presented with bone marrow relapse 3 years after completion of initial chemotherapy. Reinduction chemotherapy and blinatumomab as post-reinduction consolidation were initiated. On day 28 of blinatumomab therapy, pneumatosis intestinalis from the ascending colon to the hepatic flexure was found incidentally on abdominal computed tomography. Management and outcome: After withholding blinatumomab therapy for 1 month, pneumatosis intestinalis improved significantly without abnormal gastrointestinal symptoms.

Question: Given [Association of Preeclampsia and Perinatal Complications with Offspring Neurodevelopmental and Psychiatric Disorders. Importance: Maternal preeclampsia has been reported to increase the risk of autism spectrum disorder, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), and intellectual disability in offspring. However, the association between maternal preeclampsia combined with perinatal complications and neurodevelopmental and psychiatric disorders in offspring is less well documented. Objective: To examine the association of maternal preeclampsia, separately and together with perinatal complications, with neurodevelopmental and psychiatric disorders in offspring. Design, Setting, and Participants: This population-based cohort study used data from nationwide registries in Finland to assess all singleton live births (N = 1 012 723) between January 1, 1996, and December 31, 2014. Offspring were followed up until December 31, 2018 (when the oldest reached age 22 years). Exclusion criteria were maternal inpatient psychiatric diagnoses and pregestational diabetes. The study and data analysis were conducted from May 1, 2020, to June 1, 2021. Exposures: Preeclampsia and perinatal complications (delivery earlier than 34 weeks' gestation and/or small for gestational age). Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary outcomes were neurodevelopmental and psychiatric diagnoses and dispensation of psychotropic drugs among offspring until December 31, 2018. Cox proportional hazards regression analyses were performed to assess the associations. Results: Of 1 012 723 singleton live births (51.1% boys; mean [SD] maternal age at birth, 30.0 [5.4] years; specific data on race and ethnicity were not available in the data set), 21 010 children (2.1%) were exposed to preeclampsia alone, 33 625 children (3.3%) were exposed to perinatal complications alone, and 4891 children (0.5%) were exposed to both preeclampsia and perinatal complications. A total of 93 281 children (9.2%) were diagnosed with a neurodevelopmental or psychiatric disorder. Offspring exposed to both preeclampsia and perinatal complications had an increased risk of any neurodevelopmental or psychiatric disorder after adjusting for potential confounding (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR], 2.11; 95% CI, 1.96-2.26) compared with those not exposed to either preeclampsia or perinatal complications; this risk was higher than exposure to either preeclampsia alone (aHR, 1.18; 95% CI, 1.12-1.23) or perinatal complications alone (aHR, 1.77; 95% CI, 1.72-1.82). Sibling pair analyses did not detect any increase in the risk of neurodevelopmental or psychiatric disorders after exposure to preeclampsia alone, but offspring exposed to both preeclampsia and perinatal complications had increased risks of intellectual disabilities (aHR, 3.24; 95% CI, 1.05-10.06), specific developmental disorders (aHR, 3.56; 95% CI, 2.35-5.41), ADHD and conduct disorders (aHR, 2.42; 95% CI, 1.09-5.39), and other behavioral and emotional disorders (aHR, 2.45; 95% CI, 1.17-5.13). The risk estimates for specific developmental disorders (aHR, 2.82; 95% CI, 2.60-3.05) and ADHD and conduct disorders (aHR, 1.88; 95% CI, 1.65-2.14) were higher among offspring exposed to both preeclampsia and perinatal complications compared with those exposed to perinatal complications alone (aHR, 2.26 [95% CI, 2.18-2.33] and 1.60 [95% CI, 1.52-1.68], respectively). Conclusions and Relevance: In this study, exposure to both maternal preeclampsia and perinatal complications was associated with intellectual disabilities, specific developmental disorders, ADHD and conduct disorders, and other behavioral and emotional disorders in offspring.

Question: Given [Apremilast Prolongs the Time to First Biologic Therapy in Japanese Patients with Psoriasis. Introduction: Biologic agents are used in patients with severe psoriasis who have not adequately responded to existing conventional systemic therapies. However, only a limited number of medical institutions in Japan are approved to use them, and their relatively high cost represents a substantial burden to patients. Apremilast is an oral phosphodiesterase-4 inhibitor approved in Japan for the treatment of psoriasis vulgaris in adult patients with an inadequate response to topical therapies and psoriatic arthritis in adult patients with active disease. To date, a large-scale real-world study of treatment patterns and costs associated with apremilast in Japan has not been conducted. The objective of this study was to assess whether apremilast can prolong time to first biologic therapy use and decrease total medical cost. Methods: Using the Medical Data Vision hospital-based claims database, 506 psoriasis patients were propensity score matched and analyzed (apremilast: n = 253; non-apremilast: n = 253). Results: The incidence rate of first biologic therapy use per 1000 patient-years was significantly lower in the apremilast group than in the non-apremilast group (30.3 vs. 107.6; P < 0.001), and the total medical costs per month were significantly lower in the apremilast group than in the non-apremilast group (76,594 yen/month vs. 102,411 yen/month, P < 0.001). In a sensitivity analysis of a propensity-score-matched subset of eligible patients prescribed biologics during the follow-up period (apremilast: n = 14; non-apremilast: n = 14), the incidence of first biologic therapy use was 2,797.6 per 1000 patient-years (95% CI: 1,656.9, 4,723.6) in the non-apremilast group and 856.1 per 1000 patient-years (95% CI: 507.0, 1,445.5) in the apremilast group.

Question: Given [Boosting immune response with GM-CSF optimizes primary cryotherapy outcomes in the treatment of prostate cancer: a prospective randomized clinical trial. Objective: We explored the association of prostate cryotherapy and immunomodulation with granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GMCSF) in the generation of detectable tumor-specific T- and B-cell responses in men with prostate cancer. Materials and methods: A randomized pilot study of patients assigned to either cryotherapy alone (Control group) or in combination with GMCSF (Treatment group). The impact of therapy on the development of T- and B-cell responses against tumor-related antigens was studied using enzyme-linked immune absorbent spot (ELISpot) and protein microarray panels (Sematrix) assays, respectively. Fold changes in response to treatment were calculated by normalization of post-treatment ELISpot values against the mean pre-cryoablation response. Student t tests between treatment and control groups at 4 weeks and 12 weeks across all the antigens were performed. Results: A total of 20 patients were randomized to either control or treatment arm. At 4 weeks after cryotherapy, the treatment group demonstrated an average fold change in cancer antigen-related antibodies of 2.8% above their mean baseline values, whereas controls averaged an 18% change below mean baseline (p < 0.05). At 12 weeks, antibody response in treatment group increased to 25% above baseline, while the average of control group patients remained 9% below baseline (p < 0.05). Patients in treatment group displayed, on average, higher ELISPOT readings for the 4- and 12-week times points (527 vs 481 for PSA and 748 vs 562 for PAP). Conclusions: GMCSF appeared to broadly elevate antibodies against prostate-specific and nonspecific antigens.

Question: Given [Botanical Drug Puerarin Ameliorates Liposaccharide-Induced Depressive Behaviors in Mice via Inhibiting RagA/mTOR/p70S6K Pathways. Background. The depressive symptom hallmarks the progression of the neurodegenerative diseases, especially Alzheimer's disease. Bacterial infection is related to inflammation and depression. The present project thereby examined whether botanical drug puerarin could attenuate liposaccharide- (LPS-) induced depressive behaviors in mice. Methods. Adult male C57BL/6N mice were sequentially treated with LPS and puerarin and evaluated for the depressive behaviors by tail suspension test and forced swim test. The brain tissues were profiled for the molecular targets of puerarin by next-generation RNA sequencing technique. Candidate targets were further verified in LPS-treated mice, neural stem cells, and highly differentiated PC12 cell line. Results. Puerarin ameliorated LPS-induced depression in the mice. RNA sequencing profiles revealed that puerarin altered the expression of 16 genes while markedly downregulated Ras-related GTP-binding protein A (RagA) in LPS-treated mice. The effect of puerarin on RagA expression was confirmed by immunostaining, Western blot, and quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR). Biochemical studies showed that puerarin inhibited RagA/mTOR/p70S6K pathway, attenuated the accumulation of mTORC1 in close proximity to lysosome, and reduced the production of proinflammatory cytokines. Conclusions. Botanical drug puerarin attenuated inflammation and depressive behaviors in LPS-challenged mice by inhibiting RagA/mTOR/p70S6K pathways. Puerarin may be a lead compound for the new antidepressant drugs.

The depressive symptom hallmarks the progression of the neurodegenerative diseases, especially Alzheimer's disease. Bacterial infection is related to inflammation and depression. The present project thereby examined whether botanical drug puerarin could attenuate liposaccharide- (LPS-) induced depressive behaviors in mice. Methods. Adult male C57BL/6N mice were sequentially treated with LPS and puerarin and evaluated for the depressive behaviors by tail suspension test and forced swim test. The brain tissues were profiled for the molecular targets of puerarin by next-generation RNA sequencing technique. Candidate targets were further verified in LPS-treated mice, neural stem cells, and highly differentiated PC12 cell line. Results. Puerarin ameliorated LPS-induced depression in the mice. RNA sequencing profiles revealed that puerarin altered the expression of 16 genes while markedly downregulated Ras-related GTP-binding protein A (RagA) in LPS-treated mice. The effect of puerarin on RagA expression was confirmed by immunostaining, Western blot, and quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR). Biochemical studies showed that puerarin inhibited RagA/mTOR/p70S6K pathway, attenuated the accumulation of mTORC1 in close proximity to lysosome, and reduced the production of proinflammatory cytokines. Conclusions. Botanical drug puerarin attenuated inflammation and depressive behaviors in LPS-challenged mice by inhibiting RagA/mTOR/p70S6K pathways. Puerarin may be a lead compound for the new antidepressant drugs.

Question: Given [Finding the appropriate therapeutic strategy in patients with neuroendocrine tumors of the pancreas: Guideline recommendations meet the clinical reality. The systemic treatment of patients with pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors is based on placebo-controlled trials and long-established chemotherapy approaches. In addition, peptide receptor radionuclide therapy (PRRT) was approved as a parallel approach for pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (NET), in addition to small bowel NET, after the NETTER-1 trial. The current ESMO and NCCN guidelines attempted to describe treatment algorithms for pancreatic NET based on the current data. In our survey, we recorded therapy decisions for the first-until the third-line of therapy in German-speaking countries (Germany, Austria, and Switzerland) using fictional case reports and discussed these in the context of the current ESMO guidelines. Compared with the recommendations of the guidelines, PRRT was used more frequently and earlier. In patients with NET G1/G2 Ki-67 < 10%, the therapy algorithm consisting of somatostatin analogs (SSA)-PRRT-targeted therapy is a relevant approach. In clinical situations where chemotherapy is primarily used (remission pressure, Ki-67 > 10%), second-line PRRT was found acceptance and was often considered prior to targeted therapies. Despite the lack of prospective controlled trials, our study demonstrated the pivotal impact of PRRT. Therefore, further studies should compare PRRT with chemotherapy in pancreatic NETs in different clinical settings in first-and second-line approaches.] you can imply that [Effect of peptide receptor radionuclide first-line therapy in patients with pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors is comparable to that of chemotherapy.].

Question: Given [Peripheral blood intermediate monocyte protease-activated receptor-2 expression increases during asthma exacerbations and after inhalation allergen challenge. Background: Myeloid cells, especially dendritic cells and macrophages, play important roles in asthma pathophysiology. Monocytes (Mo) and macrophages express protease-activated receptor-2 (PAR-2), a proinflammatory serine protease receptor implicated in the pathophysiology of allergic airway inflammation. We have revealed that patients with severe asthma and those with a history of frequent asthma exacerbations exhibit increased PAR-2 expression on peripheral blood monocytes. Objective: To determine PAR-2 expression on peripheral blood intermediate monocytes (IMMo) in subjects with increased airway inflammation, either as a result of an asthma exacerbation or after an inhalation allergen challenge. Methods: A total of 16 adults who presented to the emergency department with asthma exacerbations were recruited after giving an informed consent. After 2 weeks, 10 patients returned for follow-up. A total of 11 patients with mild asthma treated only with as-needed bronchodilators were recruited and underwent inhalation allergen challenge after providing an informed consent. Immune cell profiling was performed by whole blood flow cytometry in both groups of patients. Results: PAR-2 expression in peripheral blood IMMo increased in patients with an asthma exacerbation compared with those with stable disease, but this expression decreased after treatment of the asthma exacerbation. Subjects with mild asthma had an increase in percentages of IMMo expressing PAR-2 after an allergen challenge. Patients who presented to the emergency department had lower dendritic cell and dendritic cell subset numbers in peripheral blood during exacerbation compared with after treatment. Conclusion: Increased PAR-2 expression on Mo during periods of increased airway inflammation may initiate a positive feedback loop leading to systemic inflammatory changes.] you can assume that [Increased PAR-2 expression on Peripheral blood intermediate monocytes  decreases after asthma exacerbation.Increased PAR-2 expression on peripheral blood intermediate monocytes decreases after asthma exacerbations.].

Question: Given [Botulinum Toxin Injection for the Treatment of Strabismus: A Report by the American Academy of Ophthalmology. Purpose: To review the available evidence comparing the effectiveness of extraocular muscle botulinum toxin type A (BTXA) injection with eye muscle surgery for restoring ocular alignment in children and adults with nonparalytic, nonrestrictive horizontal strabismus. Methods: Literature searches in the PubMed Cochrane Library, and clinical trial databases with no date restrictions, but limited to articles published in English, were conducted last on January 10, 2021. The searches yielded 515 citations, 40 of which were reviewed in full text by the first author. Fourteen articles met the criteria for inclusion (randomized or nonrandomized comparative studies, or case series with a minimum 50 patients; evaluating extraocular muscle BTXA injection for initial or repeat treatment of horizontal, nonparalytic, nonrestrictive strabismus; with at least 6 months of follow-up) and were graded by a methodologist. Results: The 14 included studies consisted of 2 randomized clinical trials, 3 nonrandomized comparative studies, and 9 case series. All 5 comparative studies were graded level II evidence, and the 9 case series were graded level III evidence. Successful motor outcomes after BTXA injection were relatively consistent across 4 of the 5 comparative studies at 60%, when adjustment was made for differential selection bias in 1 of the studies. In the 4 studies, successful motor outcomes after surgery ranged from 66% to 77% with a mean follow-up of 23 to 75 months, and the outcomes were not significantly different from those after BTXA injection. In the fifth level II study, success was significantly higher with BTXA injection than with surgery (94% vs. 72%). The level III BTXA case series demonstrated higher motor success rates of 87% to 89% when children were treated in 2 muscles at a time; rates were lower in adults treated with single-muscle BTXA injection. Conclusions: Extraocular muscle injection of BTXA achieves a high rate of successful motor alignment, comparable with that achieved after eye muscle surgery for nonparalytic, nonrestrictive horizontal strabismus. Good alignment may require multiple BTXA injections, and it is not yet clear whether sensory outcomes are equivalent for BTXA injections versus eye muscle surgery in young children.] you can assume that [Sensory outcomes are equivalent for extraocular muscle botulinum toxin type A injections versus eye muscle surgery in young children for the treatment of strabismus.].

Question: Given [Brain functional MRI responses to blue light stimulation in Leber's hereditary optic neuropathy.

Given that rods and cones also contribute to all these impacts of light, isolating mRGC visual and NIF roles in humans is challenging so that mRGC functions remains to be fully characterized. Here, we evaluated light-driven visual and cognitive brain responses in Leber's Hereditary Optic Neuropathy (LHON), an inherited optic neuropathy that is characterized by a selective relative sparing of the melanopsin-expressing retinal ganglion cells (mRGCs). Twelve patients and twelve matched healthy controls (HC) were enrolled in a functional brain magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) protocol including visual and visual-cognitive paradigms under blue (480 nm) and red (620 nm) light exposures. Primary visual cortex activation was detected in LHON patients; in particular higher occipital activation was found in response to sustained blue vs. red stimulation in LHON vs. HC. Similarly, brain responses to the executive task were larger under blue vs. red light in LHON over lateral prefrontal cortex.

Question: Given [Bioenergetics of Islet Preparations in a Pilot Clinical Trial of Peri-Transplant Hydroxychloroquine for Autologous Islet Transplantation. The inflammatory response is an obstacle to success in both allogeneic and autologous islet transplantation. In autologous islet transplantation (AIT), however, the recipient is also the donor, permitting pretreatment of donor/recipient for a controlled duration prior to transplantation. We sought to exploit this feature of (AIT) by pretreating donor/recipients with chronic pancreatitis undergoing total pancreatectomy and autologous islet transplantation (TPAIT) to test the hypothesis that peri-transplant treatment with the FDA-approved anti-inflammatory hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) improves graft function. In this randomized placebo-controlled pilot clinical study, patients (n = 6) were treated with oral HCQ for 30 days prior to and 90 days after TPAIT. In vivo islet function was assessed via Mixed Meal Tolerance Testing before HCQ treatment, 6- and 12-months after surgery. In vitro islet bioenergetics were assessed at the time of transplantation via extracellular flux analysis of islet preparation samples from the clinical trial cohort and six additional patients (n = 12). Our study shows that HCQ did not alter clinical endpoints, but HCQ-treated patients showed greater spare respiratory capacity (SRC) compared to samples from control patients (P=0.028). Glycolytic metabolism of islet preparations directly correlated with stimulated C-peptide secretion both before and after TPAIT (P=0.01, R2=0.489 and P=0.03, R2=0.674, respectively), and predicted in vivo islet function better than mitochondrial metabolism of islet preps or islet equivalents infused. Overnight culture of islet preparations altered bioenergetic function, significantly decreasing SRC and maximal respiration (P<0.001). In conclusion, while HCQ did not alter clinical outcomes, it was associated with significantly increased SRC in islet preparations. Bioenergetic analyses of islet preparations suggests that culture should be avoided and that glycolysis may be a more sensitive indicator of in vivo islet function than current metrics, including islet oxygen consumption and islet equivalents infused.] you can assume that [Peri-transplant treatment of donor/recipients with chronic pancreatitis undergoing total pancreatectomy and autologous islet transplantation with anti-inflammatory hydroxychloroquine improves graft function.].

An 80-year-old male patient presented with fever, cough and progressive shortness of breath for 14 days. His known history revealed a poorly treated brucellosis 18 months ago due to noncompliance. Four months later, he presented for recurrent fever. Physical examination showed a systolic aortic murmur radiating to the carotid. Blood cultures were negative; however, blocking antibodies were 1/2560. Echocardiography showed calcified aortic stenosis. Transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) showed an abscess formation at the level of the non-coronary cusp. A quadritherapy was initiated involving Ceftriaxone, gentamicin, doxycycline, and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (shortage in molecule replaced by ciprofloxacin). Patient underwent surgery. An aortic valve bioprostheses was successfully implanted one week after initiating antibiotics. Intraoperative cultures were negative. A post-operative transthoracic echocardiography revealed a moderate periprosthetic aortic leak with a mean gradient of 18mmHg. He was discharged 18 days following surgery on doxycycline, rifampicin, and ciprofloxacin for 3 more months, with adequate follow up.

Brucella endocarditis is known for large vegetations and surgery is the treatment of choice. Abscess formation can be seen in untreated patients. An 80-year-old male patient presented with fever, cough and progressive shortness of breath for 14 days. His known history revealed a poorly treated brucellosis 18 months ago due to noncompliance. Four months later, he presented for recurrent fever. Physical examination showed a systolic aortic murmur radiating to the carotid. Blood cultures were negative; however, blocking antibodies were 1/2560. Echocardiography showed calcified aortic stenosis. Transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) showed an abscess formation at the level of the non-coronary cusp.

Question: Given [Bioenergetics of Islet Preparations in a Pilot Clinical Trial of Peri-Transplant Hydroxychloroquine for Autologous Islet Transplantation. The inflammatory response is an obstacle to success in both allogeneic and autologous islet transplantation. In autologous islet transplantation (AIT), however, the recipient is also the donor, permitting pretreatment of donor/recipient for a controlled duration prior to transplantation. We sought to exploit this feature of (AIT) by pretreating donor/recipients with chronic pancreatitis undergoing total pancreatectomy and autologous islet transplantation (TPAIT) to test the hypothesis that peri-transplant treatment with the FDA-approved anti-inflammatory hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) improves graft function. In this randomized placebo-controlled pilot clinical study, patients (n = 6) were treated with oral HCQ for 30 days prior to and 90 days after TPAIT. In vivo islet function was assessed via Mixed Meal Tolerance Testing before HCQ treatment, 6- and 12-months after surgery. In vitro islet bioenergetics were assessed at the time of transplantation via extracellular flux analysis of islet preparation samples from the clinical trial cohort and six additional patients (n = 12).

Question: Given [Butorphanol in combination with dexmedetomidine provides efficient pain management in adult burn patients. Objective: This study aimed to compare the sedation and analgesic effects of butorphanol alone and butorphanol in combination with dexmedetomidine on dressing changes in adult burn patients. Method: From June 2016 to May 2019, 44 adult burn patients from our department were enrolled in this prospective, double-blinded study. Their total burn surface area (TBSA) varied from 10% to 30%; and the depth of burn injury ranged from second degree to third degree. The patients were randomized into two groups. In the control group, butorphanol combined with saline was injected into the body via venous route during dressing change. In the observation group, butorphanol in combination with dexmedetomidine was injected. The variation in mean blood pressure, heart rate, respiratory rate, and peripheral oxygen saturation were recorded at various time-points of the procedure. Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) of pain and Ramsay Sedation Scores (RSS) were also recorded at different time points. Consumption of butorphanol and adverse events in these two groups were compared. Results: The mean blood pressure and heart rate were significantly decreased in the observation group before butorphanol injection (P < 0.05) and before the dressing change (P < 0.05). The respiratory rates and peripheral oxygen saturation of these two groups showed no significant differences at all time points (P > 0.05).

Question: Given [Protocol-based cardiotoxicity monitoring in hydroxychloroquine medicated COVID-19 pediatric patients. Introduction/objectives: By May 2020, SARS-CoV-2 had caused more than 400 000 deaths worldwide. Initially, hydroxychloroquine was a treatment option for COVID-19. More recent studies have questioned its safety and efficacy and, until stronger evidence is available, it was suspended from therapy protocols. We describe our experience treating COVID-19 Portuguese pediatric patients with hydroxychloroquine, having applied a protocol for monitoring cardiac toxicity. Methods: An observational retrospective study of COVID-19 pediatric patients, admitted from March to April 2020 and treated with hydroxychloroquine. Cardiotoxicity was assessed using ECG recordings and corrected QT-time (QTc). Patients were classified into risk-groups depending on QTc value: normal, slightly elevated or severely elevated (>500 ms). Results: Total of 14 patients, with a median age of 10 years [four months; 17 years], treated with hydroxychloroquine for a median of five days. Hydroxychloroquine was used in monotherapy in six patients (mainly mild disease with comorbidities), and in association with lopinavir/ritonavir (3) and azithromycin (5) in moderate to severe disease. Other QT-prolonging therapies were used in five patients: oseltamivir (3), omeprazole (1), morphine (1) and ketamine (1).

Question: Given [C1q nephropathy in children with nephrotic syndrome: Treatment strategies and outcomes. Introduction: There is a paucity of clinical data on C1q nephropathy (C1qN) in children in India and Southeast Asia. This is the first detailed analysis conducted to elucidate the prevalence, clinicopathological profile, and response to different immunosuppressives in children with C1qN in India. Materials and Methods: Detailed demographic profile, clinical features, urine and blood chemistries, kidney biopsy, and response to different immunosuppressives of the study participants were analyzed between August 2015 and October 2020 for steroid-dependent/-resistant nephrotic syndrome (NS). Results: C1qN was diagnosed in 16 (14.13%) of 113 children who underwent biopsy for steroid-dependent/-resistant NS. The mean age was 44 months (range 18-99 months) and male and female number was 12 (75%) and four (25%), respectively, and mean follow-up was 3.5 years. Eight (50%) had coexistent minimal-change nephrotic syndrome (MCNS) pattern, seven (43.7%) had focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS), and one (6.2%) had diffuse mesangial hypercellularity. Thirteen children had complete follow-up, of which eight (61.5%) and four (30.7%) cases presented as steroid-dependent and primary steroid-resistant NS, respectively, whereas one (7.6%) had joint pain with rashes. At presentation, seven (53.8%) had hypertension, 12 (92.3%) had nephrotic range proteinuria, and six cases (46.1%) had hematuria. Nine (75%) of 12 cases achieved complete remission with calcineurin inhibitor (CNI) therapy, and two were non responders, one was a partial responder, and one responded to mycophenolate. Of six FSGS cases, four had complete remission, one had partial remission, and one was in non-remission. Of six cases with MCNS, five had complete remission and one was in non-remission. Renal functions remained normal in all except one case who had progression to chronic kidney disease Stage 3. Conclusion: One out of seven children with difficult NS can have underlying C1qN. CNIs are most beneficial to attain and maintain remission. Renal functions remain normal in the majority. Along with C1q deposits, MCNS and FSGS patterns are seen equally and respond almost similarly to CNIs.

Question: Given [Effectiveness of polymyxin B hemoperfusion in acute exacerbation of interstitial pneumonia: A retrospective analysis. Background; Acute exacerbation (AE) of interstitial pneumonia (IP) occurs commonly and has a poor prognosis. Polymyxin B hemoperfusion (PMX-DHP) has a beneficial effect on AE of some types of IPs, particularly idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). However, little is known about the efficacy of PMX-DHP in the Korean population. The aim of this study was to examine the effectiveness of PMX-DHP in AE of IP. Methods: We conducted a retrospective study of 12 patients with AE of IP, including two patients with AE of IPF, who were treated with PMX-DHP at our center.

Question: Given [CD36 is Associated With the Development of Coronary Artery Lesions in Patients With Kawasaki Disease. Kawasaki disease (KD) is an autoimmune-like vasculitis of childhood involving the coronary arteries. Macrophages require scavenger receptors such as CD36 to effectively clear cellular debris and induce self-tolerance. In this study, we hypothesized that CD36 plays an important role in the immunopathogenesis of KD, by aiding in the clearance of plasma mitochondrial DNA, and by amplifying the immune response by activating the inflammasome pathway via AIM2. Fifty-two healthy controls, 52 febrile controls, and 102 KD patients were recruited for RT-PCR of target mRNA expression and plasma mitochondrial DNA. Blood samples were obtained 24 hours prior and 21 days after the administration of intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) therapy. Patients with acute KD had higher plasma levels of cell-free mitochondrial DNA (ND1, ND4, and COX1), and higher mRNA expressions of CD36 and AIM2 when compared to both healthy and febrile controls. A greater decrease in both CD36 and AIM2 mRNA expression after IVIG therapy was associated with the development of coronary artery lesions. Coronary artery lesions were associated with a larger decrease of CD36 expression following IVIG therapy, which may indicate that prolonged expression of the scavenger receptor may have a protective effect against the development of coronary artery lesions in KD.] you can assume that [CD36 plays an important role in the development of coronary artery lesions in patients with Kawasaki disease.].

Question: Given [Brain functional MRI responses to blue light stimulation in Leber's hereditary optic neuropathy. Melanopsin retinal ganglion cells (mRGCs) are intrinsically photosensitive photoreceptors contributing both to image and non-image-forming (NIF) functions of the eye. They convey light signal to the brain to modulate circadian entrainment, sleep, alertness, cognition, brightness perception and coarse vision. Given that rods and cones also contribute to all these impacts of light, isolating mRGC visual and NIF roles in humans is challenging so that mRGC functions remains to be fully characterized. Here, we evaluated light-driven visual and cognitive brain responses in Leber's Hereditary Optic Neuropathy (LHON), an inherited optic neuropathy that is characterized by a selective relative sparing of the melanopsin-expressing retinal ganglion cells (mRGCs). Twelve patients and twelve matched healthy controls (HC) were enrolled in a functional brain magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) protocol including visual and visual-cognitive paradigms under blue (480 nm) and red (620 nm) light exposures. Primary visual cortex activation was detected in LHON patients; in particular higher occipital activation was found in response to sustained blue vs. red stimulation in LHON vs. HC. Similarly, brain responses to the executive task were larger under blue vs. red light in LHON over lateral prefrontal cortex. These findings are in line with the relative mRGC sparing demonstrated in LHON and support the mRGC contribution to both non-visual and visual brain functions, with potential implication for visual rehabilitation in hereditary optic neuropathy patients.] you can assume that [In Leber's hereditary optic neuropathy, brain responses to the executive task are larger under red light than under blue light.].

Question: Given [Protective efficacy of the peptide Subolesin antigen against the cattle tick Rhipicephalus microplus under natural infestation. The cattle tick Rhipicephalus microplus affect animal health, welfare, and cattle production in tropical and subtropical zones of the world. Anti-tick vaccines have been an effective alternative for cattle tick control instead of traditional chemical products. To date, Subolesin antigen has shown efficacy for the control of tick infestation in cattle, and previous studies showed that one peptide derived from this protein has demonstrated to elicit a strong and specific humoral immune response. Based on these findings, herein we characterized the efficacy of the peptide Subolesin for the control of cattle tick, R. microplus infestation under field conditions. Twenty-four female calves were assigned to four experimental groups and immunized with three subcutaneous doses of the peptide Subolesin, Bm86, both antigens (dual vaccine) and adjuvant/saline alone, respectively. Serum antibody levels (IgG) were assessed by ELISA and confirmed by Western blot; also, reproductive performance of naturally infested R. microplus was determined. The results showed that immunizations with the experimental antigens reduced tick infestations with vaccine's efficacy of 67 % (peptide Subolesin), 56 % (Bm86), and 49 % (dual vaccine) based on adult tick numbers, oviposition, and egg fertility between vaccinated and control animals. Peptide Subolesin-immunized calves developed a strong humoral immune response expressed by high anti-pSubolesin IgG levels, and the Western blot analysis confirmed that it is immunogenic. Cattle receiving Bm86 and dual vaccine showed less protection, although Bm86 was within the range reported previously. The negative correlation between antibody levels and reduction of naturally infested R. microplus strongly suggested that the effect of the vaccine was the result of the antibody response in immunized cattle. In conclusion, it was demonstrated that the peptide Subolesin induced a specific immune response in cattle under field conditions, resulting in reduced R. microplus populations in subsequent generations.

IMQ was topically applied to the back skin of mice for 7 consecutive days, and the mice were orally administered CD. These results showed that the oral administration of GM2 suppressed the symptoms of psoriasis, as evidenced by reductions in skin thickness, psoriasis area severity index scores for psoriasis lesions, transepidermal water loss and myeloperoxidase (MPO)-associated cell infiltration. Furthermore, GM2 reduced the pathologically increased levels of immunoglobulin G2a, MPO and TNF-a in the serum and T helper (Th)1 and Th17 cell populations in the spleen.

Question: Given [Gomisin M2 alleviates psoriasis-like skin inflammation by inhibiting inflammatory signaling pathways. Psoriasis, a chronic inflammatory skin disease, is characterized by the excessive proliferation and impaired differentiation of epidermal keratinocytes and is accompanied by the increased infiltration of inflammatory cells. The condition requires long-term treatment and has no definitive cure. Hence, supplements and therapeutic agents have been intensely investigated. Gomisin M2 (GM2), a lignan extracted from Schisandra chinensis (Turcz). Baill. (Schisandraceae; S. chinensis), has demonstrated diverse pharmacological properties, including anticancer, anti-inflammatory and antiallergic effects. Based on these findings, the present study examined the effects of GM2 on an imiquimod (IMQ)-induced psoriasis mouse model and on keratinocytes stimulated by tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-a and interferon-?.

Background The concept of combinational analysis between the methylation of O 6 -methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) and telomerase reverse transcriptase promoter (pTERT) mutation in glioblastoma (GBM) has been reported. The main study objective was to determine the prognosis of patients with GBM based on MGMT/pTERT classification, while the secondary objective was to estimate the temozolomide effect on the survival time of GBM with MGMT/pTERT classification. Methods A total of 50 GBM specimens were collected after tumor resection and were selected for investigating MGMT methylation and pTERT mutation. Clinical imaging and pathological characteristics were retrospectively analyzed. Patients with MGMT/pTERT classification were analyzed using survival analysis to develop the nomogram for forecasting and individual prognosis. Results All patients underwent resection (total resection: 28%, partial resection: 64%, biopsy: 8%). Thirty-two percent of all cases received adjuvant temozolomide with radiotherapy. Sixty-four percent of the case was found methylated MGMT, and 56% of the present cohort found pTERT mutation. Following combinational analysis of biomarkers, results showed that the GBMs with methylated MGMT and wild-type pTERT had a superior prognosis compared with other subtypes. Using Cox regression analysis with multivariable analysis, the extent of resection, postoperative chemoradiotherapy, MGMT/pTERT classification were associated with a favorable prognosis.

Background: There is a growing need for information regarding the recent coronavirus disease of 2019 (COVID-19). We present a comprehensive report of COVID-19 patients in Iran. Materials and Methods: One hundred hospitalized patients with COVID-19 were studied. Data on potential source of exposure, demographic, clinical, and paraclinical features, therapy outcome, and postdischarge follow-up were analyzed. Results: The median age of the patients was 58 years, and the majority of the patients (72.7%) were above 50 years of age. Fever was present in 45.2% of the patients on admission. The most common clinical symptoms were shortness of breath (74%) and cough (68%). Most patients had elevated C-reactive protein (92.3%), elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate (82.9%), and lymphocytopenia (74.2%) on admission. Lower lobes of the lung were most commonly involved, and ground-glass opacity (81.8%) was the most frequent finding in computed tomography scans. The administration of hydroxychloroquine improved the clinical outcome of the patients. Lopinavir/ritonavir was efficacious at younger ages.

Question: Given [COVID-19: Why Do People Refuse Vaccination? The Role of Social Identities and Conspiracy Beliefs: Evidence from Nationwide Samples of Polish Adults. In the present research, we focus on COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy, and empirically examine how different forms of social identity (defensive vs. secure national identity and identification with all humanity) and conspiracy beliefs are associated with COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy. In two cross-sectional nationwide surveys (Study 1, n = 432, and Study 2, n = 807), we found that willingness to vaccinate against COVID-19 was negatively linked to national narcissism, but positively related to a secure national identification, that is, national identification without the narcissistic component. In both studies, we also found that the relationship between narcissistic (vs. secure) national identity and unwillingness to vaccinate against COVID-19 was mediated by COVID-19 vaccine conspiracy beliefs. These effects were present even when we accounted for basic demographics (Studies 1 and 2) and identification with all humanity (Study 2), which had been found to be a significant predictor of health behaviors during COVID-19. In line with previous research, identification with all humanity was positively associated with the willingness to vaccinate against COVID-19.

In two cross-sectional nationwide surveys (Study 1, n = 432, and Study 2, n = 807), we found that willingness to vaccinate against COVID-19 was negatively linked to national narcissism, but positively related to a secure national identification, that is, national identification without the narcissistic component. In both studies, we also found that the relationship between narcissistic (vs. secure) national identity and unwillingness to vaccinate against COVID-19 was mediated by COVID-19 vaccine conspiracy beliefs. These effects were present even when we accounted for basic demographics (Studies 1 and 2) and identification with all humanity (Study 2), which had been found to be a significant predictor of health behaviors during COVID-19. In line with previous research, identification with all humanity was positively associated with the willingness to vaccinate against COVID-19.

Question: Given [Safety of intravenous tranexamic acid in patients undergoing supratentorial meningiomas resection: Protocol for a randomised, parallel-group, placebo control, non-inferiority trial. Introduction Growing evidence recommends antifibrinolytic agent tranexamic acid (TXA) to reduce blood loss and transfusions rate in various surgical settings. However, postoperative seizure, as one of the major adverse effects of TXA infusion, has been a concern that restricts its utility in neurosurgery. Methods and analysis This is a randomised, placebo-controlled, non-inferiority trial. Patients with supratentorial meningiomas and deemed suitable for surgical resection will be recruited in the trial. Patients will be randomised to receive either a single administration of 20 mg/kg TXA or a placebo of the same volume with a 1:1 allocation ratio after anaesthesia induction. The primary endpoint is the cumulative incidence of early postoperative seizures within 7 days after craniotomy. Secondary outcomes include the incidence of non-seizure complications, changes of haemoglobin level from baseline, intraoperative blood loss, erythrocyte transfusion volume, Karnofsky Performance Status, all-cause mortality, and length of stay, and total hospitalisation cost. Ethics and dissemination This trial is registered at ClinicalTrial.gov and approved by the Chinese Ethics Committee of Registering Clinical Trials (ChiECRCT20200224). The findings will be disseminated in peer-reviewed journals and presented at national or international conferences relevant to subject fields.

Question: Given [Protective efficacy of the peptide Subolesin antigen against the cattle tick Rhipicephalus microplus under natural infestation. The cattle tick Rhipicephalus microplus affect animal health, welfare, and cattle production in tropical and subtropical zones of the world. Anti-tick vaccines have been an effective alternative for cattle tick control instead of traditional chemical products. To date, Subolesin antigen has shown efficacy for the control of tick infestation in cattle, and previous studies showed that one peptide derived from this protein has demonstrated to elicit a strong and specific humoral immune response. Based on these findings, herein we characterized the efficacy of the peptide Subolesin for the control of cattle tick, R. microplus infestation under field conditions. Twenty-four female calves were assigned to four experimental groups and immunized with three subcutaneous doses of the peptide Subolesin, Bm86, both antigens (dual vaccine) and adjuvant/saline alone, respectively. Serum antibody levels (IgG) were assessed by ELISA and confirmed by Western blot; also, reproductive performance of naturally infested R. microplus was determined. The results showed that immunizations with the experimental antigens reduced tick infestations with vaccine's efficacy of 67 % (peptide Subolesin), 56 % (Bm86), and 49 % (dual vaccine) based on adult tick numbers, oviposition, and egg fertility between vaccinated and control animals. Peptide Subolesin-immunized calves developed a strong humoral immune response expressed by high anti-pSubolesin IgG levels, and the Western blot analysis confirmed that it is immunogenic. Cattle receiving Bm86 and dual vaccine showed less protection, although Bm86 was within the range reported previously. The negative correlation between antibody levels and reduction of naturally infested R. microplus strongly suggested that the effect of the vaccine was the result of the antibody response in immunized cattle. In conclusion, it was demonstrated that the peptide Subolesin induced a specific immune response in cattle under field conditions, resulting in reduced R. microplus populations in subsequent generations.

Question: Given [Can pressurised intraperitoneal aerosol chemotherapy with oxaliplatin (PIPAC-O+) be added to standard treatment for resectable high-risk gastric cancer patients? A study protocol. Objectives: Gastric cancer remains one of the most fatal cancers, despite an intensive treatment regime of chemotherapy-surgery-chemotherapy. Peritoneal metastatic disease is commonly diagnosed post treatment regime and once established, patients are likely to die in 3-9 months. Systemic chemotherapy does not increase survival for these patients due to the poor vascularisation of this area. We are proposing the addition of pressurised intraperitoneal aerosol chemotherapy (PIPAC) to the treatment regime for curative patients as a preventive measure to reduce the risk of peritoneal metastases occurring. Methods: This is a prospective, single centre, non-randomised, open-label pilot trial evaluating the addition of PIPAC to the standard multimodal treatment pathway. Patients will undergo standard neoadjuvant chemotherapy with four cycles of fluorouracil, leucovorin, oxaliplatin and docetaxel (FLOT), then PIPAC, followed by gastrectomy. Four cycles of FLOT will be administered post-surgery. Primary outcome is safety and feasibility, assessed by perioperative morbidity and possible interruptions of the standard multimodal treatment pathway.

Introduction: Low-dose, weekly cisplatin (40 mg/m2) regimens are currently utilized at Eskenazi Health in Indianapolis, Indiana for the treatment of head and neck cancer due to enhanced tolerability. This retrospective analysis analyzes the incidence, severity, and risk factors for AKI in patients who received this regimen. Methods: A retrospective chart review was conducted including patients with head and neck cancer treated with weekly, low dose cisplatin (40 mg/m2) with concurrent radiotherapy (RT). From this criteria, 22 patients were identified and included in the final analysis. AKI was defined by the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 4.03. Results: Of the 22 patients included, 12 (54.5%) experienced AKI, with 10 patients (45.5%) experiencing grade 1 AKI and 2 patients (9.1%) experiencing grade 2 AKI. Six patients (27.3%) required dose adjustments or delays due to renal adverse events, all of which had initial cisplatin total weekly doses of >70 mg. Those receiving a total weekly cisplatin dose of >70 mg were found to have a higher risk of developing an episode of AKI compared to the group receiving <70 mg (p = 0.029). Conclusion: This analysis showed patients receiving weekly doses >70 mg of cisplatin as their initial treatment dose for head and neck cancer were more likely to experience AKI.

Question: Given [Cancer-Associated Splanchnic Vein Thrombosis. Splanchnic vein thrombosis (SVT), which includes portal, mesenteric, and splenic vein thrombosis and the Budd-Chiari syndrome, is an infrequent manifestation of venous thromboembolism (VTE). Like typical site VTE, SVT is also frequently associated with cancer, particularly intra-abdominal solid malignancies and myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs). The clinical presentation of SVT is nonspecific. Symptoms may be related to the underlying malignancy, and thrombosis is incidentally diagnosed by imaging studies for cancer staging or follow-up in a substantial proportion of cases. The occurrence of SVT predicts worse prognosis in patients with liver or pancreatic cancer and, not uncommonly, SVT may precede the diagnosis of cancer. Therefore, the occurrence of an apparently unprovoked SVT should prompt careful patient evaluation for the presence of an underlying malignancy or MPN. Cancer patients carry a high risk of VTE extension and recurrence and long-term anticoagulant treatment is suggested in the absence of high risk of bleeding. Either LMWH or direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) are suggested for the treatment of patients with cancer-related SVT, although limited experience is available on the use of DOACs in these settings. Vitamin K antagonists (VKAs) are suggested for the short and long-term treatment of SVT associated with MPN.

Aim: To investigate effectiveness and safety outcomes among patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D) initiating empagliflozin versus dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitor treatment across the broad spectrum of cardiovascular risk. Methods: In a population-based cohort study we identified 39 072 pairs of 1:1 propensity score-matched adult patients with T2D initiating empagliflozin or DPP-4 inhibitors, using data from 2 US commercial insurance databases and Medicare between August 2014 and September 2017. The primary outcomes were a composite of myocardial infarction (MI)/stroke, and hospitalization for heart failure (HHF). Safety outcomes were bone fractures, lower-limb amputations (LLAs), diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), and acute kidney injury (AKI). We estimated pooled hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) adjusting for more than 140 baseline covariates. Results: Study participants had a mean age of 60 years and only 28% had established cardiovascular disease. Compared to DPP-4 inhibitors, empagliflozin was associated with similar risk of MI/stroke (HR 0.99 [95% CI 0.81-1.21]), and lower risk of HHF (HR 0.48 [95% CI 0.35-0.67] and 0.63 [95% CI 0.54-0.74], based on a primary and any heart failure discharge diagnosis, respectively).

Question: Given [Effectiveness and safety of empagliflozin in routine care patients: Results from the EMPagliflozin compaRative effectIveness and SafEty (EMPRISE) study. Aim: To investigate effectiveness and safety outcomes among patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D) initiating empagliflozin versus dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitor treatment across the broad spectrum of cardiovascular risk. Methods: In a population-based cohort study we identified 39 072 pairs of 1:1 propensity score-matched adult patients with T2D initiating empagliflozin or DPP-4 inhibitors, using data from 2 US commercial insurance databases and Medicare between August 2014 and September 2017. The primary outcomes were a composite of myocardial infarction (MI)/stroke, and hospitalization for heart failure (HHF). Safety outcomes were bone fractures, lower-limb amputations (LLAs), diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), and acute kidney injury (AKI). We estimated pooled hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) adjusting for more than 140 baseline covariates. Results: Study participants had a mean age of 60 years and only 28% had established cardiovascular disease. Compared to DPP-4 inhibitors, empagliflozin was associated with similar risk of MI/stroke (HR 0.99 [95% CI 0.81-1.21]), and lower risk of HHF (HR 0.48 [95% CI 0.35-0.67] and 0.63 [95% CI 0.54-0.74], based on a primary and any heart failure discharge diagnosis, respectively).

Question: Given [Managing Adverse Events Associated with Dinutuximab Beta Treatment in Patients with High-Risk Neuroblastoma: Practical Guidance. Neuroblastoma is the most common extracranial solid tumour in children, accounting for 15% of all paediatric cancer deaths. High-risk neuroblastoma is a particularly challenging-to-treat form of disease that requires multimodality treatment, consisting of chemotherapy, surgery, high-dose chemotherapy with autologous haematopoietic stem cell rescue, radiotherapy and differentiation therapy. However, despite intense multimodal treatment regimens, the prognosis for this patient population remains poor. In recent years, immunotherapy with anti-disialoganglioside 2 (anti-GD2) antibodies was found to improve survival rates for patients with high-risk neuroblastoma. Based on studies led by the SIOPEN (International Society of Paediatric Oncology European Neuroblastoma) group, the anti-GD2 antibody dinutuximab beta was approved for use in high-risk neuroblastoma by the European Medicines Agency and has been implemented into the standard of care in many countries across Europe. However, immunotherapy with dinutuximab beta is associated with a number of adverse events that may be challenging for clinicians, such as pain, fever, hypersensitivity reactions and capillary leak syndrome.

Question: Given [Association of Preeclampsia and Perinatal Complications with Offspring Neurodevelopmental and Psychiatric Disorders. Importance: Maternal preeclampsia has been reported to increase the risk of autism spectrum disorder, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), and intellectual disability in offspring. However, the association between maternal preeclampsia combined with perinatal complications and neurodevelopmental and psychiatric disorders in offspring is less well documented. Objective: To examine the association of maternal preeclampsia, separately and together with perinatal complications, with neurodevelopmental and psychiatric disorders in offspring. Design, Setting, and Participants: This population-based cohort study used data from nationwide registries in Finland to assess all singleton live births (N = 1 012 723) between January 1, 1996, and December 31, 2014. Offspring were followed up until December 31, 2018 (when the oldest reached age 22 years). Exclusion criteria were maternal inpatient psychiatric diagnoses and pregestational diabetes. The study and data analysis were conducted from May 1, 2020, to June 1, 2021. Exposures: Preeclampsia and perinatal complications (delivery earlier than 34 weeks' gestation and/or small for gestational age). Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary outcomes were neurodevelopmental and psychiatric diagnoses and dispensation of psychotropic drugs among offspring until December 31, 2018. Cox proportional hazards regression analyses were performed to assess the associations. Results: Of 1 012 723 singleton live births (51.1% boys; mean [SD] maternal age at birth, 30.0 [5.4] years; specific data on race and ethnicity were not available in the data set), 21 010 children (2.1%) were exposed to preeclampsia alone, 33 625 children (3.3%) were exposed to perinatal complications alone, and 4891 children (0.5%) were exposed to both preeclampsia and perinatal complications. A total of 93 281 children (9.2%) were diagnosed with a neurodevelopmental or psychiatric disorder. Offspring exposed to both preeclampsia and perinatal complications had an increased risk of any neurodevelopmental or psychiatric disorder after adjusting for potential confounding (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR], 2.11; 95% CI, 1.96-2.26) compared with those not exposed to either preeclampsia or perinatal complications; this risk was higher than exposure to either preeclampsia alone (aHR, 1.18; 95% CI, 1.12-1.23) or perinatal complications alone (aHR, 1.77; 95% CI, 1.72-1.82). Sibling pair analyses did not detect any increase in the risk of neurodevelopmental or psychiatric disorders after exposure to preeclampsia alone, but offspring exposed to both preeclampsia and perinatal complications had increased risks of intellectual disabilities (aHR, 3.24; 95% CI, 1.05-10.06), specific developmental disorders (aHR, 3.56; 95% CI, 2.35-5.41), ADHD and conduct disorders (aHR, 2.42; 95% CI, 1.09-5.39), and other behavioral and emotional disorders (aHR, 2.45; 95% CI, 1.17-5.13). The risk estimates for specific developmental disorders (aHR, 2.82; 95% CI, 2.60-3.05) and ADHD and conduct disorders (aHR, 1.88; 95% CI, 1.65-2.14) were higher among offspring exposed to both preeclampsia and perinatal complications compared with those exposed to perinatal complications alone (aHR, 2.26 [95% CI, 2.18-2.33] and 1.60 [95% CI, 1.52-1.68], respectively). Conclusions and Relevance: In this study, exposure to both maternal preeclampsia and perinatal complications was associated with intellectual disabilities, specific developmental disorders, ADHD and conduct disorders, and other behavioral and emotional disorders in offspring.

Question: Given [Case Report: Cutaneous Pleomorphic Lymphangiosarcoma in a Dog Exhibiting Features of Human Composite Hemangioendothelioma. Background: Angiosarcomas are a broad category of vascular origin neoplasms that are poorly characterized in veterinary species. Lymphangiosarcoma (LAS) is an uncommon type of angiosarcoma reported in humans and canines arising from lymphatic endothelium. LAS can be differentiated from other angiosarcomas in dogs based on expression of Prospero-related homeobox gene-1 (PROX-1) or lymphatic vessel endothelial receptor-1 (LYVE-1). Composite hemangioendothelioma (CHE) is a rare angiosarcoma subtype described in people and characterized by a variable biologic behavior and infrequent metastasis. This variant of angiosarcoma histologically combines features of retiform hemangioendothelioma and epithelioid hemangioendothelioma. Information regarding the cytologic and histopathologic appearance and clinical course of dogs with vascular tumors that exhibit features of CHE are unknown. Here, we report a case of pleomorphic LAS with features of CHE arising in a dog and treated with surgery and adjuvant chemotherapy. Case presentation: A 10-year-old intact male Labrador retriever presented with an approximately 6-cm-diameter cutaneous mass caudal to the left elbow that was progressively growing over 1.5 years. On physical examination, palpable extensions were identified coursing proximally over the triceps with concurrent loco-regional peripheral lymphadenopathy. Fine needle aspirates (FNA) and cytologic assessment of the cutaneous mass, left prescapular, and accessory axillary lymph nodes reported that this appeared to be a metastatic epithelial neoplasm, although a mixed carcinoma or collision tumor could not be excluded. An incisional biopsy of the mass was submitted for histopathology and was consistent with a well-differentiated angiosarcoma with features of CHE. The neoplasm expressed vimentin, CD31, von Willebrand factor (vWf), and PROX-1, supporting the diagnosis of LAS. Complete staging was performed, and no additional metastatic lesions were identified. Left forelimb amputation and lymph node removal were performed. Based on the diagnosis of metastatic LAS, doxorubicin chemotherapy was administered. 7 months post-amputation, the tumor recurred at the amputation site without evidence of metastatic disease. Conclusion: This report describes a malignant, locally aggressive lymphatic origin vascular tumor in a dog, with features consistent with descriptions of CHE in humans. Cytologic features in this case were discordant with its true mesenchymal etiology, obfuscating diagnosis. The morphologic features of the mesenchymal neoplastic population and immunohistochemistry (IHC) labeling ultimately supported a diagnosis of pleomorphic LAS with features of CHE.] you can assume that [Cutaneous pleomorphic lymphangiosarcoma in a dog can exhibit features of human composite hemangioendothelioma.].

Sibling pair analyses did not detect any increase in the risk of neurodevelopmental or psychiatric disorders after exposure to preeclampsia alone, but offspring exposed to both preeclampsia and perinatal complications had increased risks of intellectual disabilities (aHR, 3.24; 95% CI, 1.05-10.06), specific developmental disorders (aHR, 3.56; 95% CI, 2.35-5.41), ADHD and conduct disorders (aHR, 2.42; 95% CI, 1.09-5.39), and other behavioral and emotional disorders (aHR, 2.45; 95% CI, 1.17-5.13). The risk estimates for specific developmental disorders (aHR, 2.82; 95% CI, 2.60-3.05) and ADHD and conduct disorders (aHR, 1.88; 95% CI, 1.65-2.14) were higher among offspring exposed to both preeclampsia and perinatal complications compared with those exposed to perinatal complications alone (aHR, 2.26 [95% CI, 2.18-2.33] and 1.60 [95% CI, 1.52-1.68], respectively). Conclusions and Relevance: In this study, exposure to both maternal preeclampsia and perinatal complications was associated with intellectual disabilities, specific developmental disorders, ADHD and conduct disorders, and other behavioral and emotional disorders in offspring. For specific developmental disorders and ADHD and conduct disorders, the risk estimates were higher among offspring exposed to both preeclampsia and perinatal complications compared with those exposed to perinatal complications only.] you can imply that [Exposure to both maternal preeclampsia and perinatal complications is not associated with intellectual disabilities, specific developmental disorders, ADHD, conduct disorders, or other behavioral and emotional disorders in offspring.].

Question: Given [Case Report: Cutaneous Pleomorphic Lymphangiosarcoma in a Dog Exhibiting Features of Human Composite Hemangioendothelioma. Background: Angiosarcomas are a broad category of vascular origin neoplasms that are poorly characterized in veterinary species. Lymphangiosarcoma (LAS) is an uncommon type of angiosarcoma reported in humans and canines arising from lymphatic endothelium. LAS can be differentiated from other angiosarcomas in dogs based on expression of Prospero-related homeobox gene-1 (PROX-1) or lymphatic vessel endothelial receptor-1 (LYVE-1). Composite hemangioendothelioma (CHE) is a rare angiosarcoma subtype described in people and characterized by a variable biologic behavior and infrequent metastasis. This variant of angiosarcoma histologically combines features of retiform hemangioendothelioma and epithelioid hemangioendothelioma. Information regarding the cytologic and histopathologic appearance and clinical course of dogs with vascular tumors that exhibit features of CHE are unknown. Here, we report a case of pleomorphic LAS with features of CHE arising in a dog and treated with surgery and adjuvant chemotherapy. Case presentation: A 10-year-old intact male Labrador retriever presented with an approximately 6-cm-diameter cutaneous mass caudal to the left elbow that was progressively growing over 1.5 years. On physical examination, palpable extensions were identified coursing proximally over the triceps with concurrent loco-regional peripheral lymphadenopathy. Fine needle aspirates (FNA) and cytologic assessment of the cutaneous mass, left prescapular, and accessory axillary lymph nodes reported that this appeared to be a metastatic epithelial neoplasm, although a mixed carcinoma or collision tumor could not be excluded. An incisional biopsy of the mass was submitted for histopathology and was consistent with a well-differentiated angiosarcoma with features of CHE. The neoplasm expressed vimentin, CD31, von Willebrand factor (vWf), and PROX-1, supporting the diagnosis of LAS. Complete staging was performed, and no additional metastatic lesions were identified. Left forelimb amputation and lymph node removal were performed. Based on the diagnosis of metastatic LAS, doxorubicin chemotherapy was administered. 7 months post-amputation, the tumor recurred at the amputation site without evidence of metastatic disease. Conclusion: This report describes a malignant, locally aggressive lymphatic origin vascular tumor in a dog, with features consistent with descriptions of CHE in humans. Cytologic features in this case were discordant with its true mesenchymal etiology, obfuscating diagnosis. The morphologic features of the mesenchymal neoplastic population and immunohistochemistry (IHC) labeling ultimately supported a diagnosis of pleomorphic LAS with features of CHE.] you can imply that [Cutaneous pleomorphic lymphangiosarcoma in a dog can exhibit features of human composite hemangioendothelioma.].

Question: Given [SARS-CoV-2 vaccination does not induce relapses of patients with inflammatory bowel disease. Background Vaccination against SARS-CoV-2 is a promising strategy to protect immunocompromised IBD patients from a severe course of COVID-19. As these patients were excluded from initial clinical vaccination trials, patients frequently express concerns regarding the safety of these vaccines, especially whether vaccination might trigger IBD flares (hit-and-run-hypothesis). Methods In order to assess the risk of an IBD flare after vaccination against SARS-CoV-2, an anonymous survey was performed at five German IBD centers and one patient organization (Deutsche Morbus Crohn/Colitis ulcerosa Vereinigung (DCCV) e.V.) in August and October 2021. Results The questionnaire was answered by 914 patients, 781 of whom reported a previous vaccination against SARS-CoV-2 (85.4%). Vaccination against SARS-CoV-2 was not associated with an increased risk of IBD flares (p=0.319) or unscheduled visits to the IBD physician (p=0.848). Furthermore, typical symptoms of an IBD flare including abdominal pain, increases in stool frequency, or rectal bleeding were not influenced by the vaccination.

Question: Given [Infantile Spasms and Trisomy 21: Unfavorable Outcomes with First-line Vigabatrin Therapy. Introduction: Among children with infantile spasms (ISs), those with trisomy 21 (T21) and those with normal development at onset and no identifiable etiology (previously referred to as idiopathic) are expected to have relatively favorable outcomes. The study objective is to determine if differences exist in treatment response, relapse, and subsequent epilepsy between these two groups when vigabatrin is used as first-line treatment. Methods: In this retrospective study, patients were classified into the following groups and clinical features were compared: T21 (n = 24) and IS with normal development at onset and no identified etiology (n = 40; control group). Results: There was no significant difference in the age of IS onset, sex distribution, or treatment lag between the groups. The T21 compared to the control group required a higher mean number of anti-seizure therapies (3.6 vs. 1.9, p < 0.001), had more relapses [10 (42%) vs. 4 (10%), p < 0.005)], and had higher risk of subsequent epilepsy [11 (46%) vs. 8 (20%), p < 0.003]. Relapses were often delayed in the T21 group, with a mean of 8 months after IS cessation. Conclusion: Our results differ from most studies using steroids as first-line treatment where the groups were shown to have similar treatment response and T21 patients had a low risk of relapse and subsequent epilepsy. Therefore, our results suggest that vigabatrin as first-line treatment in T21 with IS may be less favorable than steroids.

Question: Given [Case Report: Preemptive Treatment With Low-Dose PD-1 Blockade and Azacitidine for Molecular Relapsed Acute Myeloid Leukemia With RUNX1-RUNX1T1 After Allogeneic Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation. Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients who develop hematological relapse (HR) after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) generally have dismal clinical outcomes. Measurable residual disease (MRD)-directed preemptive interventions are effective approaches to prevent disease progression and improve prognosis for molecular relapsed patients with warning signs of impending HR. In this situation, boosting the graft-vs-leukemia (GVL) effect with immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) might be a promising prevention strategy, despite the potential for causing severe graft-vs-host disease (GVHD). In the present study, we reported for the first time an AML patient with RUNX1-RUNX1T1 who underwent preemptive treatment with the combined application of tislelizumab (an anti-PD-1 antibody) and azacitidine to avoid HR following allo-HSCT. On day +81, molecular relapse with MRD depicted by RUNX1-RUN1T1-positivity as well as mixed donor chimerism occurred in the patient. On day +95, with no signs of GVHD and an excellent eastern cooperative oncology group performance status (ECOG PS), the patient thus was administered with 100 mg of tislelizumab on day 1 and 100 mg of azacitidine on days 1-7. After the combination therapy, complete remission was successfully achieved with significant improvement in hematologic response, and the MRD marker RUNX1-RUNX1T1 turned negative, along with a complete donor chimerism in bone marrow. Meanwhile, the patient experienced moderate GVHD and immune-related adverse events (irAEs), successively involving the lung, liver, lower digestive tract and urinary system, which were well controlled by immunosuppressive therapies. As far as we know, this case is the first one to report the use of tislelizumab in combination with azacitidine to prevent post-transplant relapse in AML. In summary, the application of ICIs in MRD positive patients might be an attractive strategy for immune modulation in the future to reduce the incidence of HR in the post-transplant setting, but safer clinical application schedules need to be explored.] you can assume that [The combined application of tislelizumab (an anti-PD-1 antibody) and azacitidine is an effective treatment to reduce the incidence of hematological relapse after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients.].

TP53 R181C, KRAS G12C and SMAD4 R361H were identified as driver mutations of the tumor. In addition to abundant infiltrated lymphocytes, immunotherapy induced high levels of inhibitory components in post-treatment tissue samples, especially the FOXP3+ regulatory T cells in tumor and PD-L1 expression in the lymph node. Despite abundant TLSs in the post-treatment tumor, most TLSs were immature. Moreover, increasing levels of circulating checkpoint proteins BTLA, TIM-3, LAG-3, PD-1, PD-L1, and CTLA4 were observed during immunotherapy.

Question: Given [Feasibility and safety of whole lung irradiation in the treatment of canine appendicular osteosarcoma. Whole lung irradiation (WLI) has been used successfully in humans as an adjuvant treatment for osteosarcoma. The aim of this study is to describe the feasibility and safety of WLI in dogs with appendicular osteosarcoma. Twelve client-owned dogs with appendicular osteosarcoma that had successfully completed amputation and four doses of carboplatin without evidence of gross metastasis were enrolled in this prospective clinical trial. Ten once-daily fractions of 1.75 Gy were administered to the planning target volume encompassing the lungs. Overall, WLI was well tolerated in these patients. No dogs developed symptoms of pneumonitis or pulmonary fibrosis. Haematopoietic toxicity evaluated during radiation therapy was found to be mild. The median disease free interval for WLI treated dogs was not significantly different than the median DFI for a group of historic control dogs (376 days for WLI treated dogs versus 304.5 days for control dogs; p = 0.5461). Although no significant improvement in outcome was observed with this study, WLI appears to be safe in dogs and warrants further investigation to characterize the efficacy and toxicity.] you can imply that [Whole lung irradiation is safe and effective in the treatment of canine appendicular osteosarcoma.].

Question: Given [Case Report: Sarcoid-Like Reactions and Tertiary Lymphoid Structures Following Dual Checkpoint Inhibition in a Patient with Early-Stage Lung Adenocarcinoma. Immune checkpoint inhibitor-induced sarcoid-like reactions and tertiary lymphoid structures (TLSs) are increasingly recognized but rarely reported in the same patient. We report a patient with lung adenocarcinoma who displayed sarcoid-like reactions in intrathoracic lymph nodes and tertiary lymphoid structures in surgical tumor after neoadjuvant therapy with nivolumab plus ipilimumab. Pathological examination revealed 50% residual tumor cells after treatment, and the CT evaluation of the primary tumor showed a stable disease.

Question: Given [Receptor mechanisms mediating the anti-neuroinflammatory effects of endocannabinoid system modulation in a rat model of migraine. Calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP), substance P and dural mast cells are main contributors in neurogenic inflammation underlying migraine pathophysiology. Modulation of endocannabinoid system attenuates migraine pain, but its mechanisms of action remain unclear. We investigated receptor mechanisms mediating anti-neuroinflammatory effects of endocannabinoid system modulation in in vivo migraine model and ex vivo hemiskull preparations in rats. To induce acute model of migraine, a single dose of nitroglycerin was intraperitoneally administered to male rats. Moreover, isolated ex vivo rat hemiskulls were prepared to study CGRP and substance P release from meningeal trigeminal afferents. We used methanandamide (cannabinoid agonist), rimonabant (cannabinoid receptor-1 CB1 antagonist), SR144528 (CB2 antagonist) and capsazepine (transient receptor potential vanilloid-1 TRPV1 antagonist) to explore effects of endocannabinoid system modulation on the neurogenic inflammation, and possible involvement of CB1, CB2 and TRPV1 receptors during endocannabinoid effects. Methanandamide attenuated nitroglycerin-induced CGRP increments in in vivo plasma, trigeminal ganglia and brainstem and also in ex vivo hemiskull preparations. Methanandamide also alleviated enhanced number and degranulation of dural mast cells induced by nitroglycerin. Rimonabant, but not capsazepine or SR144528, reversed the attenuating effects of methanandamide on CGRP release in both in vivo and ex vivo experiments. Additionally, SR144528, but not rimonabant or capsazepine, reversed the attenuating effects of methanandamide on dural mast cells.

Question: Given [Desmopressin treatment in dipsogenic form of primary polydipsia: Keep serum osmolality marginally below thirst threshold for symptomatic relief. Dipsogenic polydipsia (DP), a distinct variety of primary polydipsia, is characterised by selective diminution of osmotic threshold for thirst leading to polydipsia and subsequent hypotonic polyuria. Seen in patients without underlying psychiatric illness, DP closely mimics central diabetes insipidus (CDI), making it difficult for clinicians to discriminate these two conditions from each other. Carefully performed osmotic stimulation study, incorporating objective assessment of threshold for thirst and arginine vasopressin (AVP) release is the key to differentiate DP from CDI or psychogenic polydipsia, also termed compulsive water drinking (CWD). Low thirst threshold and high AVP release threshold separate DP from CDI and CWD, respectively. Unlike CWD, desmopressin may be successfully used in DP without concomitant risk of hyponatremia. We describe a child, in whom an initial diagnosis of partial CDI was subsequently revised to DP based on osmotic stimulation test.

Question: Given [Case report: Proton pump inhibitor drug-related problem in pancreatic cancer patient unmasks pancreatic enzyme insufficiency. Introduction: Palliative care aims to improve the quality of life of patients with a life-limiting or life-threatening illness and is multifaceted involving comprehensive interdisciplinary assessments and interventions. Interdisciplinary palliative care in the setting of untreatable cancer diagnoses is of particular importance due to additional considerations that must be taken as patients are often undergoing palliative chemotherapy and/or radiation therapy. These patients' complexity warrants special considerations and attentiveness to drug-related problems. Case report: The purpose of this case report is to highlight the importance of both complete and comprehensive medication histories in cancer care and the impact of proton pump inhibitors on pancreatic enzyme insufficiencies secondary to pancreatic cancers. This case involves a drug-related problem involving three medications that are commonly used in pancreatic cancer patients: pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy, a proton pump inhibitor, and a fluoroquinolone antibiotic. The patient presented in this case report is an 80-year-old man diagnosed with unresectable pancreatic cancer with a history of symptomatic gastroesophageal reflux disease managed with a proton pump inhibitor, specifically tablets of the 40 mg strength of pantoprazole magnesium taken orally once daily. During the patient's first of five 28-day cycles of palliative-intent chemotherapy with gemcitabine and nab-paclitaxel, the patient presented to the emergency department due to fever and, although not severely neutropenic, was prescribed amoxicillin/clavulanate and ciprofloxacin due to his advanced age. After reading a patient advisory on a ciprofloxacin patient information sheet that advised avoidance of concomitant administration of ciprofloxacin and magnesium, the patient self-discontinued his pantoprazole as it was a magnesium salt formulation. This discontinuation was followed by two weeks of persistent foul-smelling diarrhea, flatulence, and abdominal pain. Management and outcome: The patient's healthcare team symptomatically managed the patient with oral and intravenous rehydration unaware of the cause of the symptoms. A trial of pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy was initiated; however, it was unsuccessful in resolving his symptoms. After further investigation and a more in-depth patient interview, it was discovered that the discontinued proton pump inhibitor was likely the cause of the patient's new symptoms and was subsequently re-initiated. Pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy in combination with re-initiation of pantoprazole therapy essentially resolved all symptoms. Discussion: Before his diagnosis of unresectable pancreatic cancer, the patient had been on proton pump inhibitor therapy for nearly a decade. He had significant atrophy of the pancreas and an undoubtedly decreased pancreatic enzyme and bicarbonate production; however, he did not experience foul-smelling diarrhea indicative of pancreatic enzyme insufficiency while he was on his proton pump inhibitor. We believe that with his proton pump inhibitor therapy, he was unknowingly being partially treated for his worsening pancreatic enzyme insufficiency, specifically the component related to his lack of bicarbonate production and secretion. His discontinuation of his proton pump inhibitor led to a decrease in gastric acid, small bowel, and normal intraduodenal pH, which resulted in any remaining pancreatic enzyme reserve to become non-functional, unmasking his pancreatic enzyme insufficiency. An initial empiric trial of pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy failed in the absence of a proton pump inhibitor; however, within days of restarting his proton pump inhibitor along with pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy, his gastrointestinal symptoms completely resolved. This is due to the decrease of gastric and intraduodenal acidity, which better enabled the function of pancreatic enzymes present in pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy.] you can assume that [Proton pump inhibitors are commonly used in the palliative care of pancreatic cancer patients.].

The patient presented in this case report is an 80-year-old man diagnosed with unresectable pancreatic cancer with a history of symptomatic gastroesophageal reflux disease managed with a proton pump inhibitor, specifically tablets of the 40 mg strength of pantoprazole magnesium taken orally once daily. During the patient's first of five 28-day cycles of palliative-intent chemotherapy with gemcitabine and nab-paclitaxel, the patient presented to the emergency department due to fever and, although not severely neutropenic, was prescribed amoxicillin/clavulanate and ciprofloxacin due to his advanced age. After reading a patient advisory on a ciprofloxacin patient information sheet that advised avoidance of concomitant administration of ciprofloxacin and magnesium, the patient self-discontinued his pantoprazole as it was a magnesium salt formulation. This discontinuation was followed by two weeks of persistent foul-smelling diarrhea, flatulence, and abdominal pain. Management and outcome: The patient's healthcare team symptomatically managed the patient with oral and intravenous rehydration unaware of the cause of the symptoms. A trial of pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy was initiated; however, it was unsuccessful in resolving his symptoms. After further investigation and a more in-depth patient interview, it was discovered that the discontinued proton pump inhibitor was likely the cause of the patient's new symptoms and was subsequently re-initiated. Pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy in combination with re-initiation of pantoprazole therapy essentially resolved all symptoms. Discussion: Before his diagnosis of unresectable pancreatic cancer, the patient had been on proton pump inhibitor therapy for nearly a decade. He had significant atrophy of the pancreas and an undoubtedly decreased pancreatic enzyme and bicarbonate production; however, he did not experience foul-smelling diarrhea indicative of pancreatic enzyme insufficiency while he was on his proton pump inhibitor. We believe that with his proton pump inhibitor therapy, he was unknowingly being partially treated for his worsening pancreatic enzyme insufficiency, specifically the component related to his lack of bicarbonate production and secretion. His discontinuation of his proton pump inhibitor led to a decrease in gastric acid, small bowel, and normal intraduodenal pH, which resulted in any remaining pancreatic enzyme reserve to become non-functional, unmasking his pancreatic enzyme insufficiency. An initial empiric trial of pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy failed in the absence of a proton pump inhibitor; however, within days of restarting his proton pump inhibitor along with pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy, his gastrointestinal symptoms completely resolved. This is due to the decrease of gastric and intraduodenal acidity, which better enabled the function of pancreatic enzymes present in pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy.] you can infer that [Proton pump inhibitors are commonly used in the palliative care of pancreatic cancer patients.].

Question: Given [Effectiveness of low-dose radiation therapy in COVID-19 patients globally: A systematic review. Background: Novel Corona Virus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) can affect multiple organs, including the lungs, resulting in pneumonia. Apart from steroids, other anti-COVID drugs that have been studied appear to have little or no effect on COVID-19 pneumonia. There is a well-known history of inflammatory disease, including pneumonia, treated with low-dose radiation therapy (LDRT). It reduces the production of proinflammatory cytokines, Interleukin-1a (IL-1a), and leukocyte recruitment. Methods: A comprehensive literature search was conducted using PubMed, Scopus, Embase, CINAHL, and Google Scholar, with keywords such as 'radiotherapy,' 'low-dose radiation therapy,' 'low-dose irradiation,' 'covid-19 pneumonia,' 'SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia,' and 'covid pneumonia.' with additional filters for human studies and customized articles in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses. We reviewed randomized controlled trials, quasi-experimental studies, cohort, case-control, and cross-sectional studies with a clearly defined intervention, including low-dose radiotherapy alone or in combination with any therapy to treat COVID-19 pneumonia from December 2019 to May 2021. Patients receiving standard or high-dose radiotherapy, including for other diseases, were excluded. Zotero software was used to collect and organize research from various databases, remove duplicates, extract relevant data, and record decisions. Participants' demographics and baseline status were obtained from the full-text articles along with the intervention's outcome/effect on patient status. Results: Four studies with 61 participants that met the inclusion criteria were included. One was a double-blind randomized controlled trial, one a non-randomized trial, while the other two were single-arm clinical trials. Low-dose radiation therapy did not show any significant improvement in COVID-19 patients. Conclusion: Only two studies included in this review demonstrated an improvement in inflammatory markers; however, patients were also given steroids or other drugs. Therefore, the confounding effects must be considered before drawing conclusions. This systematic review does not support mortality benefit, clinical course improvement, or imaging changes with LDRT.] you can imply that [low-dose radiation therapy is beneficial in COVID-19 patients.].

Question: Given [Clinical practices underlie COVID-19 patient respiratory microbiome composition and its interactions with the host. Understanding the pathology of COVID-19 is a global research priority. Early evidence suggests that the respiratory microbiome may be playing a role in disease progression, yet current studies report contradictory results. Here, we examine potential confounders in COVID-19 respiratory microbiome studies by analyzing the upper (n = 58) and lower (n = 35) respiratory tract microbiome in well-phenotyped COVID-19 patients and controls combining microbiome sequencing, viral load determination, and immunoprofiling. We find that time in the intensive care unit and type of oxygen support, as well as associated treatments such as antibiotic usage, explain the most variation within the upper respiratory tract microbiome, while SARS-CoV-2 viral load has a reduced impact. Specifically, mechanical ventilation is linked to altered community structure and significant shifts in oral taxa previously associated with COVID-19. Single-cell transcriptomics of the lower respiratory tract of COVID-19 patients identifies specific oral bacteria in physical association with proinflammatory immune cells, which show higher levels of inflammatory markers. Overall, our findings suggest confounders are driving contradictory results in current COVID-19 microbiome studies and careful attention needs to be paid to ICU stay and type of oxygen support, as bacteria favored in these conditions may contribute to the inflammatory phenotypes observed in severe COVID-19 patients.] you can assume that [Patient respiratory microbiome composition contributes to the inflammatory phenotypes observed in severe COVID-19 patients.].

Question: Given [Celecoxib inhibits cancer growth through cyclooxygenase 2 (COX2) independent pathways in HepG2 hepatocellular carcinoma. Chronic inflammation has long been associated to carcinogenesis. Evidence has shown that nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) may decrease the risk of certain types of cancer. In this study, we assessed the anti-proliferative effects of different NSAIDs against liver cancer using HepG2 cell line. In addition, we evaluated the combined effects of a selective COX2 inhibitor (Celecoxib) with chemotherapeutic drugs. The anti-proliferative and combined effects of COX2 inhibitors were evaluated by MTT assay. The effect of COX2 inhibitors on gene expression was assessed using real time PCR (RT-PCR). Also, the effect of COX2 inhibitors on colony formation was assessed through colony-formation assay. COX2 inhibitors treatment significantly inhibited the growth of HepG2 cells in a dose-dependent manner. The combined treatment of Celecoxib with either doxorubicin or raloxifene resulted in synergistic effects. In addition, Celecoxib treatment significantly reduced the expression of Bcl2 and VEGF genes in HepG2 cells, while the COX2 gene was not detected at all in HepG2 cell line suggesting that the anti-tumorigenic activity of Celecoxib is COX2 independent.

We investigated the clinicopathological significance of BTK positivity in DLBCL according to known molecules related to resistance to BTK inhibitors [BCL2 apoptosis regulator (BCL2)/MYC protooncogene, bHLH transcription factor (MYC)]. Patients and Methods: We evaluated BTK expression immunohistochemically in 106 DLBCLs considering their BCL2/MYC status. Results: Considering the whole cohort, BTK was expressed in 65.1%, including 70.4% (50/71) of non-germinal center B-cell-like (non-GCB) subtype; BCL2 expression was detected in 60.4%, MYC expression in 15.1%, MYC translocation in 4.2% (4/96) and MYC gain/amplification in 7.6% (8/105).

Question: Given [Cesium treatment depresses glycolysis pathway in HeLa cell. Background/Aims: Cesium (Cs) is an alkali metal element that is of no essential use for humans; it has no known beneficial function that is verified by clinical research. When used as an alternative cancer therapy, it even causes toxicity in high doses. Thus, before using Cs as treatment in clinical settings, it is important to clearly determine its biological effects on cells. However, Cs was found to suppress the proliferation of human cervical cancer cells in a dose-dependent manner, and it was assumed that Cs inhibits the glycolysis pathway. In this study, we clearly determined the step of the glycolysis pathway that is affected by Cs. Methods: The glycolytic enzyme expressions, activities, and metabolite concentrations in HeLa cells were measured by PCR, western blotting, and enzymatic methods, after treating the cells with Cs for 3 days. Results: Cs treatment decreased transcriptional and expression levels of hexokinase, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, pyruvate kinase (PK), and lactate dehydrogenase and the activity of PK. Analysis of glycolysis pathway metabolites revealed that Cs treatment reduces lactate level and increases the level of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (oxidized form, NAD+); however, it did not affect the levels of pyruvate and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (reduced form, NADH). Increase of the [NAD+]/[NADH] ratio and decrease of the [lactate]/[pyruvate] ratio indicate that Cs treatment inhibits the aerobic glycolysis pathway.

A total of 96 rabbits of age 35 days were randomly assigned to one of four treatment groups: a control group (C), a Zn group supplemented with dietary zinc (50 mg/kg), a TE group receiving thyme extract applied in drinking water (1 ml/L), and a Zn + TE group treated with both additives. Lipid peroxidation in the plasma was influenced by Zn intake and in the kidney was affected by both the Zn and TE treatment (P < 0.05). Zn supplementation led to a significant increase in glutathione peroxidase activity (P = 0.017), total antioxidant capacity (P = 0.009) and total thiol groups level (P = 0.047) in the kidney, with the highest values occurring in rabbits receiving the combination Zn + TE. Administration of TE influenced Zn content in the kidney (P < 0.001), while zinc intake decreased Cu concentration in muscle (P = 0.021). In conclusion, the simultaneous administration of organic Zn and TE positively affected the antioxidant response of kidneys and can be used for improving the antioxidant status of growing rabbits.] you can assume that [The simultaneous administration of organic zinc and thyme extract can be used to improve the antioxidant status of growing rabbits.].

Question: Given [Clinical profile and initial treatment of non-small cell lung cancer: a retrospective cohort study at the Uganda Cancer Institute. Introduction: Lung cancer is a major global public health burden constituting 11.6% of all new cancer diagnoses and 18.4% of all cancer-related mortality Purpose: To describe the clinical profile and initial treatment of non-small cell lung cancer in Uganda Methods: We reviewed charts of a cohort of patients with a histologically confirmed diagnosis of non-small cell lung can-cer, treated between January 2013 and November 2015 at the Uganda Cancer Institute. Results: A total of 74 patients met the inclusion criteria. The median age was 56 years (IQR 47-70), with 16.2% below the age 45 years, and 51% were female. Only 10 percent were active smokers and the most frequent histological subtype was adenocarcinoma (71%). The majority (91.9%) had stage IV disease at diagnosis and frequent metastases to contralateral lung, liver, and bones. Twenty-seven (27) patients received platinum-based chemotherapy, while 27 patients received erlotinib, and only 4 patients received palliative thoracic radiotherapy. The median survival time was 12.4 months, and the overall response rate was 32.7%. There was no survival difference by type of systemic treatment, and on multivariate analysis, poor performance status was predictive of adverse outcomes (p < 0.001).

Question: Given [Docking Screens of Noncovalent Interaction Motifs of the Human Subtype-D2 Receptor-75 Schizophrenia Antipsychotic Complexes with Physicochemical Appraisal of Antipsychotics. Chemoinformatics appraisal and molecular docking were employed to investigate 225 complexes of 75 schizophrenia antipsychotics with the dopamine receptor subtypes D2R, D3R, and D4R. Considering the effective noncovalent interactions in the subtype-D2 receptor selectivity of antipsychotics, this study evaluated the possible physicochemical properties of ligands underlying the design of safer and more effective antipsychotics. The pan-Assay interference compounds (PAINs) include about 25% of typical antipsychotics and 5% of atypicals. Popular antipsychotics like haloperidol, clozapine, risperidone, and aripiprazole are not PAINs. They have stronger interactions with D2R and D4R, but their interactions with D3R are slightly weaker, which is similar to the behavior of dopamine. In contrast to typical antipsychotics, atypical antipsychotics exhibit more noncovalent interactions with D4R than with D2R. These results suggest that selectivity to D2R and D4R comes from the synergy between hydrophobic and hydrogen-bonding interactions through their concomitant occurrence in the form of a hydrogen-bonding site adorned with hydrophobic contacts in antipsychotic-receptor complexes. All the antipsychotics had more synergic interactions with D2R and D4R in comparison with D3R. The atypical antipsychotics made a good distinction between the subtype D2 receptors with high selectivity to D4R. Among the popular antipsychotics, haloperidol, clozapine, and risperidone have hydrophobic-hydrogen-bonding synergy with D4R, while aripiprazole profits with D2R. The most important residue participating in the synergic interactions was threonine for D2R and cysteine for D4R.

Question: Given [Cilostazol Induces Apoptosis and Inhibits Proliferation of Hepatocellular Carcinoma Cells by Activating AMPK. Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the most common primary liver cancer and one of the leading causes of cancer-related death. Cilostazol, an antiplatelet drug, elicits anticancer effects on human squamous cell carcinoma and colon cancer cells. We previously reported that cilostazol protects normal mature hepatocytes from alcohol-induced apoptotic cell death. In addition, cilostazol stimulates liver regeneration after hepatectomy. Therefore, this study evaluated whether cilostazol elicits pro- or anti-proliferative effects on HCC using Hep3B and SK-Hep1 cells. Cilostazol inhibited proliferation of HCC cells by inducing apoptosis. Additionally, cilostazol induced G0/G1 cell cycle arrest and decreased expression of cyclin D1 and proliferating cell nuclear antigen. Activation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and inhibition of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) and AKT signaling were associated with the anti-proliferative effect of cilostazol. LY294002 and PD98059, inhibitors of AKT and ERK, respectively, enhanced the anti-proliferative effect of cilostazol. By contrast, inhibition of AMPK using compound C or AMPK-targeting siRNA abolished the anti-proliferative effect of cilostazol. Moreover, AMPK inhibition reversed the down-regulation of AKT/EKR induced by cilostazol, indicating negative cross-talk between AMPK and AKT/ERK. These findings provide evidence that cilostazol exerts anti-tumor activity in HCC by counter-regulating AMPK and AKT/ERK signaling. Taken together, our findings suggest that cilostazol may provide clinical benefits in HCC patients by selectively targeting HCC cells without interfering with liver function.] you can assume that [Ilostazol exerts anti-tumor activity in hepatocellular carcinoma by counter-regulating AMPK and AKT/ERK signaling.].

Question: Given [Cilostazol Induces Apoptosis and Inhibits Proliferation of Hepatocellular Carcinoma Cells by Activating AMPK. Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the most common primary liver cancer and one of the leading causes of cancer-related death. Cilostazol, an antiplatelet drug, elicits anticancer effects on human squamous cell carcinoma and colon cancer cells. We previously reported that cilostazol protects normal mature hepatocytes from alcohol-induced apoptotic cell death. In addition, cilostazol stimulates liver regeneration after hepatectomy. Therefore, this study evaluated whether cilostazol elicits pro- or anti-proliferative effects on HCC using Hep3B and SK-Hep1 cells. Cilostazol inhibited proliferation of HCC cells by inducing apoptosis. Additionally, cilostazol induced G0/G1 cell cycle arrest and decreased expression of cyclin D1 and proliferating cell nuclear antigen. Activation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and inhibition of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) and AKT signaling were associated with the anti-proliferative effect of cilostazol. LY294002 and PD98059, inhibitors of AKT and ERK, respectively, enhanced the anti-proliferative effect of cilostazol. By contrast, inhibition of AMPK using compound C or AMPK-targeting siRNA abolished the anti-proliferative effect of cilostazol. Moreover, AMPK inhibition reversed the down-regulation of AKT/EKR induced by cilostazol, indicating negative cross-talk between AMPK and AKT/ERK. These findings provide evidence that cilostazol exerts anti-tumor activity in HCC by counter-regulating AMPK and AKT/ERK signaling. Taken together, our findings suggest that cilostazol may provide clinical benefits in HCC patients by selectively targeting HCC cells without interfering with liver function.] you can infer that [Ilostazol exerts anti-tumor activity in hepatocellular carcinoma by counter-regulating AMPK and AKT/ERK signaling.].

Question: Given [Docking Screens of Noncovalent Interaction Motifs of the Human Subtype-D2 Receptor-75 Schizophrenia Antipsychotic Complexes with Physicochemical Appraisal of Antipsychotics. Chemoinformatics appraisal and molecular docking were employed to investigate 225 complexes of 75 schizophrenia antipsychotics with the dopamine receptor subtypes D2R, D3R, and D4R. Considering the effective noncovalent interactions in the subtype-D2 receptor selectivity of antipsychotics, this study evaluated the possible physicochemical properties of ligands underlying the design of safer and more effective antipsychotics. The pan-Assay interference compounds (PAINs) include about 25% of typical antipsychotics and 5% of atypicals. Popular antipsychotics like haloperidol, clozapine, risperidone, and aripiprazole are not PAINs. They have stronger interactions with D2R and D4R, but their interactions with D3R are slightly weaker, which is similar to the behavior of dopamine.

Question: Given [Anesthesia, Sedation, and Unplanned Extubation of Tracheal Intubation in Children with Severe Pneumonia. We randomly divided 200 children with severe pneumonia who met the indications for tracheal intubation into 2 groups in this prospective study. One group that received dexmedetomidine for sedation was recorded as the dexmedetomidine group (n = 100), and the group that received midazolam for sedation was recorded as the midazolam group (n = 100). We compared the anesthesia sedation scores, time to fall asleep, time to wake up from anesthesia, related hemodynamic parameters, and adverse reactions between the two groups of children. The failure mode and effect analysis method (FMEA) was also used to investigate the causes of unplanned extubation (UEX) of tracheal intubation in 32 children with severe pneumonia. Our conclusion is as follows: (1) Compared with midazolam, the comprehensive effect of dexmedetomidine on children with severe pneumonia undergoing tracheal intubation for anesthesia and sedation is better, it can effectively shorten the anesthesia induction time and the recovery time after stopping the drug, and there are few adverse reactions, which is worthy of application and promotion. (2) UEX is an important risk factor in the monitoring and nursing of children with severe pneumonia tracheal intubation, and the nursing method of PDCA cycle management is particularly important for them.

Aims: Estimate the clinical and economic benefits of lenzilumab plus standard of care (SOC) compared with SOC alone in the treatment of patients hospitalized with COVID-19 pneumonia from the United States (US) hospital perspective. Materials and methods: A per-patient cost calculator was developed to report the clinical and economic benefits associated with adding lenzilumab to SOC in newly hospitalized COVID-19 patients over 28 days. Clinical inputs were based on the LIVE-AIR trial, including failure to achieve survival without ventilation (SWOV), mortality, time to recovery, intensive care unit (ICU) admission, and invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV) use. Base case costs included the anticipated list price of lenzilumab, drug administration, and hospital resource costs based on the level of care required. A scenario analysis examined projected one-year rehospitalization costs. Results: In the base case and all scenarios, lenzilumab plus SOC improved all specified clinical outcomes relative to SOC alone. Lenzilumab plus SOC resulted in estimated cost savings of $3,190 per patient in a population aged <85 years with C-reactive protein (CRP) levels <150 mg/L and receiving remdesivir (base case).

Question: Given [Association of Human Milk Antibody Induction, Persistence, and Neutralizing Capacity with SARS-CoV-2 Infection vs mRNA Vaccination. Importance: Long-term effect of parental COVID-19 infection vs vaccination on human milk antibody composition and functional activity remains unclear. Objective: To compare temporal IgA and IgG response in human milk and microneutralization activity against SARS-CoV-2 between lactating parents with infection and vaccinated lactating parents out to 90 days after infection or vaccination. Design, Setting, and Participants: Convenience sampling observational cohort (recruited July to December 2020) of lactating parents with infection with human milk samples collected at days 0 (within 14 days of diagnosis), 3, 7, 10, 28, and 90. The observational cohort included vaccinated lactating parents with human milk collected prevaccination, 18 days after the first dose, and 18 and 90 days after the second dose. Exposures: COVID-19 infection diagnosed by polymerase chain reaction within 14 days of consent or receipt of messenger RNA (mRNA) COVID-19 vaccine (BNT162b2 or mRNA-1273). Main Outcomes and Measures: Human milk anti-SARS-CoV-2 receptor-binding domain IgA and IgG and microneutralization activity against live SARS-CoV-2 virus. Results: Of 77 individuals, 47 (61.0%) were in the infection group (mean [SD] age, 29.9 [4.4] years), and 30 (39.0%) were in the vaccinated group (mean [SD] age, 33.0 [3.4] years; P =.002). The mean (SD) age of infants in the infection and vaccinated group were 3.1 (2.2) months and 7.5 (5.2) months, respectively (P <.001). Infection was associated with a variable human milk IgA and IgG receptor-binding domain-specific antibody response over time that was classified into different temporal patterns: upward trend and level trend (33 of 45 participants [73%]) and low/no response (12 of 45 participants [27%]). Infection was associated with a robust and quick IgA response in human milk that was stable out to 90 days after diagnosis. Vaccination was associated with a more uniform IgG-dominant response with concentrations increasing after each vaccine dose and beginning to decline by 90 days after the second dose. Vaccination was associated with increased human milk IgA after the first dose only (mean [SD] increase, 31.5 [32.6] antibody units). Human milk collected after infection and vaccination exhibited microneutralization activity.

Question: Given [Association of Human Milk Antibody Induction, Persistence, and Neutralizing Capacity with SARS-CoV-2 Infection vs mRNA Vaccination. Importance: Long-term effect of parental COVID-19 infection vs vaccination on human milk antibody composition and functional activity remains unclear. Objective: To compare temporal IgA and IgG response in human milk and microneutralization activity against SARS-CoV-2 between lactating parents with infection and vaccinated lactating parents out to 90 days after infection or vaccination. Design, Setting, and Participants: Convenience sampling observational cohort (recruited July to December 2020) of lactating parents with infection with human milk samples collected at days 0 (within 14 days of diagnosis), 3, 7, 10, 28, and 90. The observational cohort included vaccinated lactating parents with human milk collected prevaccination, 18 days after the first dose, and 18 and 90 days after the second dose. Exposures: COVID-19 infection diagnosed by polymerase chain reaction within 14 days of consent or receipt of messenger RNA (mRNA) COVID-19 vaccine (BNT162b2 or mRNA-1273). Main Outcomes and Measures: Human milk anti-SARS-CoV-2 receptor-binding domain IgA and IgG and microneutralization activity against live SARS-CoV-2 virus. Results: Of 77 individuals, 47 (61.0%) were in the infection group (mean [SD] age, 29.9 [4.4] years), and 30 (39.0%) were in the vaccinated group (mean [SD] age, 33.0 [3.4] years; P =.002). The mean (SD) age of infants in the infection and vaccinated group were 3.1 (2.2) months and 7.5 (5.2) months, respectively (P <.001). Infection was associated with a variable human milk IgA and IgG receptor-binding domain-specific antibody response over time that was classified into different temporal patterns: upward trend and level trend (33 of 45 participants [73%]) and low/no response (12 of 45 participants [27%]). Infection was associated with a robust and quick IgA response in human milk that was stable out to 90 days after diagnosis. Vaccination was associated with a more uniform IgG-dominant response with concentrations increasing after each vaccine dose and beginning to decline by 90 days after the second dose. Vaccination was associated with increased human milk IgA after the first dose only (mean [SD] increase, 31.5 [32.6] antibody units). Human milk collected after infection and vaccination exhibited microneutralization activity.

Question: Given [C1q nephropathy in children with nephrotic syndrome: Treatment strategies and outcomes. Introduction: There is a paucity of clinical data on C1q nephropathy (C1qN) in children in India and Southeast Asia. This is the first detailed analysis conducted to elucidate the prevalence, clinicopathological profile, and response to different immunosuppressives in children with C1qN in India. Materials and Methods: Detailed demographic profile, clinical features, urine and blood chemistries, kidney biopsy, and response to different immunosuppressives of the study participants were analyzed between August 2015 and October 2020 for steroid-dependent/-resistant nephrotic syndrome (NS). Results: C1qN was diagnosed in 16 (14.13%) of 113 children who underwent biopsy for steroid-dependent/-resistant NS. The mean age was 44 months (range 18-99 months) and male and female number was 12 (75%) and four (25%), respectively, and mean follow-up was 3.5 years. Eight (50%) had coexistent minimal-change nephrotic syndrome (MCNS) pattern, seven (43.7%) had focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS), and one (6.2%) had diffuse mesangial hypercellularity. Thirteen children had complete follow-up, of which eight (61.5%) and four (30.7%) cases presented as steroid-dependent and primary steroid-resistant NS, respectively, whereas one (7.6%) had joint pain with rashes. At presentation, seven (53.8%) had hypertension, 12 (92.3%) had nephrotic range proteinuria, and six cases (46.1%) had hematuria. Nine (75%) of 12 cases achieved complete remission with calcineurin inhibitor (CNI) therapy, and two were non responders, one was a partial responder, and one responded to mycophenolate. Of six FSGS cases, four had complete remission, one had partial remission, and one was in non-remission. Of six cases with MCNS, five had complete remission and one was in non-remission. Renal functions remained normal in all except one case who had progression to chronic kidney disease Stage 3. Conclusion: One out of seven children with difficult NS can have underlying C1qN. CNIs are most beneficial to attain and maintain remission. Renal functions remain normal in the majority.

Question: Given [Clinical practices underlie COVID-19 patient respiratory microbiome composition and its interactions with the host. Understanding the pathology of COVID-19 is a global research priority. Early evidence suggests that the respiratory microbiome may be playing a role in disease progression, yet current studies report contradictory results. Here, we examine potential confounders in COVID-19 respiratory microbiome studies by analyzing the upper (n = 58) and lower (n = 35) respiratory tract microbiome in well-phenotyped COVID-19 patients and controls combining microbiome sequencing, viral load determination, and immunoprofiling. We find that time in the intensive care unit and type of oxygen support, as well as associated treatments such as antibiotic usage, explain the most variation within the upper respiratory tract microbiome, while SARS-CoV-2 viral load has a reduced impact. Specifically, mechanical ventilation is linked to altered community structure and significant shifts in oral taxa previously associated with COVID-19. Single-cell transcriptomics of the lower respiratory tract of COVID-19 patients identifies specific oral bacteria in physical association with proinflammatory immune cells, which show higher levels of inflammatory markers. Overall, our findings suggest confounders are driving contradictory results in current COVID-19 microbiome studies and careful attention needs to be paid to ICU stay and type of oxygen support, as bacteria favored in these conditions may contribute to the inflammatory phenotypes observed in severe COVID-19 patients.] you can assume that [Patient respiratory microbiome composition contributes to the inflammatory phenotypes observed in severe COVID-19 patients.].

Question: Given [Clinical profile and initial treatment of non-small cell lung cancer: a retrospective cohort study at the Uganda Cancer Institute. Introduction: Lung cancer is a major global public health burden constituting 11.6% of all new cancer diagnoses and 18.4% of all cancer-related mortality Purpose: To describe the clinical profile and initial treatment of non-small cell lung cancer in Uganda Methods: We reviewed charts of a cohort of patients with a histologically confirmed diagnosis of non-small cell lung can-cer, treated between January 2013 and November 2015 at the Uganda Cancer Institute. Results: A total of 74 patients met the inclusion criteria. The median age was 56 years (IQR 47-70), with 16.2% below the age 45 years, and 51% were female. Only 10 percent were active smokers and the most frequent histological subtype was adenocarcinoma (71%). The majority (91.9%) had stage IV disease at diagnosis and frequent metastases to contralateral lung, liver, and bones. Twenty-seven (27) patients received platinum-based chemotherapy, while 27 patients received erlotinib, and only 4 patients received palliative thoracic radiotherapy. The median survival time was 12.4 months, and the overall response rate was 32.7%. There was no survival difference by type of systemic treatment, and on multivariate analysis, poor performance status was predictive of adverse outcomes (p < 0.001). Conclusions: Patients with non-small cell lung cancer in Uganda frequently presented with late-stage disease at diagnosis. The majority of patients were female, never-smokers, and had predominantly adenocarcinoma subtype.] you can imply that [Patients with non-small cell lung cancer in Uganda frequently presented with late-stage disease at diagnosis.].

Question: Given [Apremilast Prolongs the Time to First Biologic Therapy in Japanese Patients with Psoriasis. Introduction: Biologic agents are used in patients with severe psoriasis who have not adequately responded to existing conventional systemic therapies. However, only a limited number of medical institutions in Japan are approved to use them, and their relatively high cost represents a substantial burden to patients. Apremilast is an oral phosphodiesterase-4 inhibitor approved in Japan for the treatment of psoriasis vulgaris in adult patients with an inadequate response to topical therapies and psoriatic arthritis in adult patients with active disease. To date, a large-scale real-world study of treatment patterns and costs associated with apremilast in Japan has not been conducted. The objective of this study was to assess whether apremilast can prolong time to first biologic therapy use and decrease total medical cost. Methods: Using the Medical Data Vision hospital-based claims database, 506 psoriasis patients were propensity score matched and analyzed (apremilast: n = 253; non-apremilast: n = 253). Results: The incidence rate of first biologic therapy use per 1000 patient-years was significantly lower in the apremilast group than in the non-apremilast group (30.3 vs. 107.6; P < 0.001), and the total medical costs per month were significantly lower in the apremilast group than in the non-apremilast group (76,594 yen/month vs. 102,411 yen/month, P < 0.001). In a sensitivity analysis of a propensity-score-matched subset of eligible patients prescribed biologics during the follow-up period (apremilast: n = 14; non-apremilast: n = 14), the incidence of first biologic therapy use was 2,797.6 per 1000 patient-years (95% CI: 1,656.9, 4,723.6) in the non-apremilast group and 856.1 per 1000 patient-years (95% CI: 507.0, 1,445.5) in the apremilast group. Conclusion: These results suggest that apremilast prolongs the time to first biologic therapy use in patients with psoriasis, thereby reducing the total medical cost and decreasing the economic burden on patients.] you can assume that [Apremilast can reduce total medical costs per month compared to the non-apremilast group in Japanese patients with psoriasis.].

Question: Given [Clustering and Erratic Movement Patterns of Syringe-Injected versus Mosquito-Inoculated Malaria Sporozoites Underlie Decreased Infectivity. Malaria vaccine candidates based on live, attenuated sporozoites have led to high levels of protection. However, their efficacy critically depends on the sporozoites' ability to reach and infect the host liver. Administration via mosquito inoculation is by far the most potent method for inducing immunity but highly impractical. Here, we observed that intradermal syringe-injected Plasmodium berghei sporozoites (syrSPZ) were 3-fold less efficient in migrating to and infecting mouse liver than mosquito-inoculated sporozoites (msqSPZ). This was related to a clustered dermal distribution (2-fold-decreased median distance between syrSPZ and msqSPZ) and, more importantly, a 1.4-fold (significantly)-slower and more erratic movement pattern. These erratic movement patterns were likely caused by alteration of dermal tissue morphology (.15-mm intercellular gaps) due to injection of fluid and may critically decrease sporozoite infectivity. These results suggest that novel microvolume-based administration technologies hold promise for replicating the success of mosquito-inoculated live, attenuated sporozoite vaccines. IMPORTANCE Malaria still causes a major burden on global health and the economy. The efficacy of live, attenuated malaria sporozoites as vaccine candidates critically depends on their ability to migrate to and infect the host liver. This work sheds light on the effect of different administration routes on sporozoite migration. We show that the delivery of sporozoites via mosquito inoculation is more efficient than syringe injection; however, this route of administration is highly impractical for vaccine purposes. Using confocal microscopy and automated imaging software, we demonstrate that syringe-injected sporozoites do cluster, move more slowly, and display more erratic movement due to alterations in tissue morphology.

Background The concept of combinational analysis between the methylation of O 6 -methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) and telomerase reverse transcriptase promoter (pTERT) mutation in glioblastoma (GBM) has been reported. The main study objective was to determine the prognosis of patients with GBM based on MGMT/pTERT classification, while the secondary objective was to estimate the temozolomide effect on the survival time of GBM with MGMT/pTERT classification. Methods A total of 50 GBM specimens were collected after tumor resection and were selected for investigating MGMT methylation and pTERT mutation. Clinical imaging and pathological characteristics were retrospectively analyzed. Patients with MGMT/pTERT classification were analyzed using survival analysis to develop the nomogram for forecasting and individual prognosis. Results All patients underwent resection (total resection: 28%, partial resection: 64%, biopsy: 8%). Thirty-two percent of all cases received adjuvant temozolomide with radiotherapy. Sixty-four percent of the case was found methylated MGMT, and 56% of the present cohort found pTERT mutation. Following combinational analysis of biomarkers, results showed that the GBMs with methylated MGMT and wild-type pTERT had a superior prognosis compared with other subtypes. Using Cox regression analysis with multivariable analysis, the extent of resection, postoperative chemoradiotherapy, MGMT/pTERT classification were associated with a favorable prognosis. Hence, a web-based nomogram was developed for deploying individual prognostication. Conclusions The interaction of MGMT methylation and pTERT mutation was confirmed for predicting prognosis.

Question: Given [Combined ASBT Inhibitor and FGF15 Treatment Improves Therapeutic Efficacy in Experimental Nonalcoholic Steatohepatitis. Background & Aims: Pharmacologic agents targeting bile acid signaling show promise for treating nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). However, clinical findings suggest that new treatment strategies with enhanced therapeutic efficacy and minimized undesired effects are needed. This preclinical study investigates whether combining an apical sodium-bile acid transporter (ASBT) inhibitor GSK233072 (GSK672) and fibroblast growth factor-15 (FGF15) signaling activation improves anti-NASH efficacy. Methods: Mice with high fat, cholesterol, and fructose (HFCFr) diet-induced NASH and stage 2 fibrosis are used as a NASH model. GSK672 or AAV8-TBG-FGF15 interventions are administered alone or in combination to HFCFr diet-fed mice. Results: The combined treatment significantly enhances therapeutic efficacy against steatosis, inflammation, ballooning, and fibrosis than either single treatment. Mechanistically, the synergistic actions of GSK672 and FGF15 on inhibiting gut bile acid reuptake and hepatic bile acid synthesis achieve greater magnitude of bile acid pool reduction that not only decreases bile acid burden in NASH livers but also limits intestinal lipid absorption, which, together with FGF15 signaling activation, produces weight loss, reduction of adipose inflammation, and attenuated hepatocellular organelle stress. Furthermore, the combined treatment attenuates increased fecal bile acid excretion and repressed bile acid synthesis, which underlie diarrhea and hypercholesterolemia associated with ASBT inhibition and FGF19 analogue, respectively, in clinical settings. Conclusions: Concomitant ASBT inhibition and FGF15 signaling activation produce metabolic changes that partially mimic the bariatric surgery condition whereby lipid malabsorption and increased FGF15/19 signaling synergistically mediate weight loss and metabolic improvement. Further clinical studies may be warranted to investigate whether combining ASBT inhibitor and FGF19 analogue enhances anti-NASH efficacy and reduced treatment-associated adverse events in humans.] you can assume that [Combined apical sodium-bile acid transporter inhibitor GSK233072 and AAV8-TBG-FGF15 treatment improves therapeutic efficacy in human nonalcoholic steatohepatitis.].

Results All patients underwent resection (total resection: 28%, partial resection: 64%, biopsy: 8%). Thirty-two percent of all cases received adjuvant temozolomide with radiotherapy. Sixty-four percent of the case was found methylated MGMT, and 56% of the present cohort found pTERT mutation. Following combinational analysis of biomarkers, results showed that the GBMs with methylated MGMT and wild-type pTERT had a superior prognosis compared with other subtypes. Using Cox regression analysis with multivariable analysis, the extent of resection, postoperative chemoradiotherapy, MGMT/pTERT classification were associated with a favorable prognosis. Hence, a web-based nomogram was developed for deploying individual prognostication. Conclusions The interaction of MGMT methylation and pTERT mutation was confirmed for predicting prognosis.

Question: Given [Combined ASBT Inhibitor and FGF15 Treatment Improves Therapeutic Efficacy in Experimental Nonalcoholic Steatohepatitis. Background & Aims: Pharmacologic agents targeting bile acid signaling show promise for treating nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). However, clinical findings suggest that new treatment strategies with enhanced therapeutic efficacy and minimized undesired effects are needed. This preclinical study investigates whether combining an apical sodium-bile acid transporter (ASBT) inhibitor GSK233072 (GSK672) and fibroblast growth factor-15 (FGF15) signaling activation improves anti-NASH efficacy. Methods: Mice with high fat, cholesterol, and fructose (HFCFr) diet-induced NASH and stage 2 fibrosis are used as a NASH model. GSK672 or AAV8-TBG-FGF15 interventions are administered alone or in combination to HFCFr diet-fed mice. Results: The combined treatment significantly enhances therapeutic efficacy against steatosis, inflammation, ballooning, and fibrosis than either single treatment. Mechanistically, the synergistic actions of GSK672 and FGF15 on inhibiting gut bile acid reuptake and hepatic bile acid synthesis achieve greater magnitude of bile acid pool reduction that not only decreases bile acid burden in NASH livers but also limits intestinal lipid absorption, which, together with FGF15 signaling activation, produces weight loss, reduction of adipose inflammation, and attenuated hepatocellular organelle stress. Furthermore, the combined treatment attenuates increased fecal bile acid excretion and repressed bile acid synthesis, which underlie diarrhea and hypercholesterolemia associated with ASBT inhibition and FGF19 analogue, respectively, in clinical settings. Conclusions: Concomitant ASBT inhibition and FGF15 signaling activation produce metabolic changes that partially mimic the bariatric surgery condition whereby lipid malabsorption and increased FGF15/19 signaling synergistically mediate weight loss and metabolic improvement. Further clinical studies may be warranted to investigate whether combining ASBT inhibitor and FGF19 analogue enhances anti-NASH efficacy and reduced treatment-associated adverse events in humans.] you can infer that [Combined apical sodium-bile acid transporter inhibitor GSK233072 and AAV8-TBG-FGF15 treatment improves therapeutic efficacy in human nonalcoholic steatohepatitis.].

Question: Given [Prognostic Impact of the Combination of MGMT Methylation and TERT Promoter Mutation in Glioblastoma. Background The concept of combinational analysis between the methylation of O 6 -methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) and telomerase reverse transcriptase promoter (pTERT) mutation in glioblastoma (GBM) has been reported. The main study objective was to determine the prognosis of patients with GBM based on MGMT/pTERT classification, while the secondary objective was to estimate the temozolomide effect on the survival time of GBM with MGMT/pTERT classification.

Question: Given [Pimavanserin Promotes Trophic Factor Release and Protects Cultured Primary Dopaminergic Neurons Exposed to MPP+ in a GDNF-Dependent Manner. Neurodegeneration and impaired neural development are a common feature of many neuropsychiatric disorders. Second-generation antipsychotics (SGAs) and certain atypical antidepressants display neuroprotective effects. Though these drugs interact with many molecular targets, a common shared attribute is high antagonist potency at 5-HT2A receptors. Pimavanserin is a selective 5-HT2A inverse agonist/antagonist that was recently FDA approved for treating hallucinations and delusions associated with Parkinson's disease. Unlike SGAs, pimavanserin lacks activity at other targets like dopamine, histamine, muscarinic, and adrenergic receptors. To investigate whether selective 5-HT2A inverse agonists have neuroprotective properties, pimavanserin and another selective 5-HT2A inverse agonist, M100907, were applied to primary cultures of dopaminergic neurons treated with 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium (MPP+). Both pimavanserin and M100907 protected dopaminergic neurons against MPP+-induced cell death. The neuroprotective effects of pimavanserin required signaling through the extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 pathway, restored mitochondrial function, and reduced oxidative stress. Further investigation showed that pimavanserin promotes the release of brain-derived neurotrophic factor and glial-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) and that the neuroprotective effects of pimavanserin were blocked by antibodies to GDNF but not by anti-tyrosine receptor kinase B receptor antibodies. Thus, pimavanserin induces release of neurotrophic factors and protects dopaminergic neurons against MPP+ toxicity in a GDNF-dependent manner.

Question: Given [Combining sonodynamic therapy with chemoradiation for the treatment of pancreatic cancer. Treatment options for patients with pancreatic cancer are limited and survival prospects have barely changed over the past 4 decades. Chemoradiation treatment (CRT) has been used as neoadjuvant therapy in patients with borderline resectable disease to reduce tumour burden and increase the proportion of patients eligible for surgery. Antimetabolite drugs such as gemcitabine and 5-fluorouracil are known to sensitise pancreatic tumours to radiation treatment. Likewise, photodynamic therapy (PDT) has also been shown to enhance the effect of radiation therapy. However, PDT is limited to treating superficial lesions due to the attenuation of light by tissue. The ability of the related technique, sonodynamic therapy (SDT), to enhance CRT was investigated in two murine models of pancreatic cancer (PSN-1 and BxPC-3) in this study. SDT uses low intensity ultrasound to activate an otherwise non-toxic sensitiser, generating toxic levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) locally. It is applicable to greater target depths than PDT due to the ability of ultrasound to propagate further than light in tissue. Both CRT and the combination of CRT plus SDT delayed tumour growth in the two tumour models. In the PSN-1 model, but not the BxPC-3 model, the combination treatment caused an increase in survival relative to CRT alone (p = 0.038). The improvement in survival conferred by the addition of SDT in this model may be related to differences in tumour architecture between the two models.

Question: Given [Effect of Methadone Maintenance on Expression of BDNF and CREB Genes in Brain VTA of Male Morphine Treated Rats. Background: Morphine independently reduces the expression level of Brain-derived Neurotrophic Factor (BDNF) and Cyclic-AMP Response Element Binding protein (CREB). BDNF and CREB play a vital role in protecting and regulating the proper functioning of neurons. There has not been any study on the effect of methadone maintenance treatment and its comparison with morphine. Therefore, this study was conducted to examine the effect of methadone maintenance on the expression of BDNF and CREB genes in brain VTA of male morphine treated rats. Methods: In this study, 24 Wistar rats (200-250g) were assigned to three experimental groups: 1) Animals without morphine treatment (control); 2) Morphine treated animals (10 mg/kg, twice/day through subcutaneous injection for 21 days); 3) Animals under methadone maintenance after treatment with morphine (maintenance dose of methadone was achieved during 14 days equal to 1 mg per 100 ml at the first week and 2.5 mg per 100 ml at second week). To evaluate the expression of BDNF and CREB genes, real time PCR method was used, and ELISA was applied to measure the serum level of BDNF protein at the end of the experiment. Results: According to the findings of this study, similar to morphine treated group, methadone maintenance in morphine treated animals led to a significant reduction in the expression of BDNF and CREB genes at VTA as well BDNF serum level compared with the control group.

To explore the effects of the anti-VEGF drug and glucocorticoid by injection before the end of vitrectomy for proliferative diabetic retinopathy (PDR). Methods. Eighty PDR patients who underwent vitrectomy in our hospital (July 2020-June 2022) were selected as the research objects and randomized into group A (n = 40) and group B (n = 40) according to the order of admission. Before the end of surgery, group B was injected with glucocorticoid (triamcinolone acetonide) into the vitreous cavity, and group A was injected with anti-VEGF drug (conbercept). The ophthalmic parameters, incidence of complications, diabetes indexes, and surgical indexes of the two groups were compared. Results. The best corrected visual acuity (BCVA), central macular thickness (CMT), macular blood flow density and intraocular pressure in group A were remarkably better than those in group B (P<0.001). The incidence of complications (P<0.05) and VEG/F level (P<0.001) in group A were obviously lower than those in group B. There was no significant difference in fasting blood glucose (FBG) and surgical indexes between the two groups (P>0.05). Conclusion. Conbercept injection before the end of vitrectomy can improve the ophthalmic parameters, reduce the level of VEGF, and lower the possibility of postsurgical complications. Therefore, the low-cost and efficient anti-VEGF drug should be promoted and applied in practice.

Methods: In this study, 24 Wistar rats (200-250g) were assigned to three experimental groups: 1) Animals without morphine treatment (control); 2) Morphine treated animals (10 mg/kg, twice/day through subcutaneous injection for 21 days); 3) Animals under methadone maintenance after treatment with morphine (maintenance dose of methadone was achieved during 14 days equal to 1 mg per 100 ml at the first week and 2.5 mg per 100 ml at second week). To evaluate the expression of BDNF and CREB genes, real time PCR method was used, and ELISA was applied to measure the serum level of BDNF protein at the end of the experiment. Results: According to the findings of this study, similar to morphine treated group, methadone maintenance in morphine treated animals led to a significant reduction in the expression of BDNF and CREB genes at VTA as well BDNF serum level compared with the control group. Conclusion: It was concluded that methadone, like morphine, causes a significant reduction in the expression of BDNF and CREB genes in the brain VTA area of rats as well as BDNF serum level compared with the control group.] you can infer that [methadone causes a significant reduction in the expression of BDNF and CREB genes in the brain VTA area of rats.].

Question: Given [Comparative Analysis of the Effects of the Anti-VEGF Drug and Glucocorticoid by Injection before the End of Vitrectomy for Proliferative Diabetic Retinopathy. Objective. To explore the effects of the anti-VEGF drug and glucocorticoid by injection before the end of vitrectomy for proliferative diabetic retinopathy (PDR). Methods. Eighty PDR patients who underwent vitrectomy in our hospital (July 2020-June 2022) were selected as the research objects and randomized into group A (n = 40) and group B (n = 40) according to the order of admission. Before the end of surgery, group B was injected with glucocorticoid (triamcinolone acetonide) into the vitreous cavity, and group A was injected with anti-VEGF drug (conbercept). The ophthalmic parameters, incidence of complications, diabetes indexes, and surgical indexes of the two groups were compared. Results. The best corrected visual acuity (BCVA), central macular thickness (CMT), macular blood flow density and intraocular pressure in group A were remarkably better than those in group B (P<0.001). The incidence of complications (P<0.05) and VEG/F level (P<0.001) in group A were obviously lower than those in group B. There was no significant difference in fasting blood glucose (FBG) and surgical indexes between the two groups (P>0.05). Conclusion. Conbercept injection before the end of vitrectomy can improve the ophthalmic parameters, reduce the level of VEGF, and lower the possibility of postsurgical complications. Therefore, the low-cost and efficient anti-VEGF drug should be promoted and applied in practice.

Question: Given [Phenethyl Isothiocyanate Enhances the Cytotoxic Effects of PARP Inhibitors in High-Grade Serous Ovarian Cancer Cells. While PARP inhibitor (PARPi) therapies have shown promising results in the treatment of high-grade serous ovarian cancer (HGSOC) harboring homologous recombination deficiencies, primary resistance to PARPi frequently occurs and even initial responders may eventually become resistant. Therefore, the development of novel effective combinatorial strategies to treat HGSOC is urgently needed. Here, we report that H2O2-induced oxidative stress sensitized HGSOC cells to PARPi BMN 673. Furthermore, Phenethyl isothiocyanate (PEITC) as a ROS-inducing agent significantly enhanced the cytotoxic effects of BMN 673. Mechanistically, combined use of PEITC and BMN 673 resulted in ROS overproduction and accumulation, enhanced DNA damage, G2/M arrest and apoptosis, all of which were significantly reversed by the ROS scavenger N-Acetyl-L-cysteine. We also showed that while PEITC did not further enhance the ability of BMN 673 on PARP1 trapping in HGSOC cells, the therapeutic effects of the PEITC/BMN 673 combination were at least in part dependent on the presence of PARP1. Importantly, the PEITC/BMN 673 combination potently abrogated the growth of HGSOC tumor spheroids and patient-derived organoid models of HGSOC and cervical cancer.

Question: Given [Comparative analysis of chronic rhinitis patient profiles during autumn pollen season between grassland and non-grassland cities in North China. Background: The symptoms of patients with respiratory disease are influenced by local environmental factors. The incidence of allergic rhinitis in grassland areas was significantly higher than that in non-grassland areas. We aimed to compare the profiles of chronic rhinitis patients obtained during the autumn pollen season in Baotou (grassland city) and Beijing (non-grassland city), China. Methods: Questionnaire surveys and allergen testing were conducted on 1170 and 1232 patients with chronic rhinitis visiting the Second Affiliated Hospital of Baotou Medical College and Beijing Tongren Hospital, respectively, during the autumn pollen period. Information regarding medical history, severity of symptoms, and diagnosis and treatment was collected. Results: More patients with moderate to severe chronic rhinitis and asthma (both, P < 0.001) were present in Baotou than in Beijing. Mugwort was the most abundant allergen in both regions, but the number of patients sensitized to outdoor allergens in Baotou was higher than that in Beijing (P < 0.001). Indoor allergens in Beijing represented a considerable proportion of allergens, especially dust mites (33.4%).

Question: Given [D-chiro-inositol induces ovulation in non-polycystic ovary syndrome (Pcos), non-insulin-resistant young women, likely by modulating aromatase expression: A report of 2 cases. Objective: Unknown etiology Background: Anovulation consists in the lack of oocyte release during the menstrual cycle, leading to an irregular menstrual cycle. Untreated chronic anovulation is one of the major causes of female infertility and can induce hypoestrogenism. Different etiological factors can contribute to anovulation; therefore, the clinical approaches to manage this condition should take into account the specific patient characteristics. Oral ovulation-inducing agents are first-line treatments for most anovulatory patients. Drugs used include selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs) such as clomiphene citrate and aromatase inhibitors (AIs) such as letrozole. The latter, in particular, halts the estrogen biosynthesis by blocking the activity of steroidogenic enzyme aromatase, which catalyzes the conversion of androgens to estrogens. Similarly, d-chiro-inositol (DCI) modulates the activity of aromatase by reducing the corresponding gene expression, and DCI supplementation was successfully used to induce ovulation in anovulatory PCOS patients. Here, we report the use of DCI to induce ovulation in non-PCOS anovulatory oligomenorrheic women. Case Reports: Two young non-PCOS anovulatory oligomenorrheic women received treatment with high-dose (1200 mg) DCI for 6 weeks. Based on an initial evaluation, both patients had normal hormone levels and were non-insulin-resistant. Ovulation assessment was based on the increment of progesterone and LH levels, as well as on the endometrial thickening. Also, the treatment with DCI resulted in a reduction of testosterone levels relative to baseline values.

Importance: Lifelong immunoglobulin replacement therapy (IRT) is standard-of-care treatment for congenital agammaglobulinemia but accrues high annual costs ($30000-$90000 per year) and decrements to quality of life over patients' life spans. Hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) offers an alternative 1-time therapy, but has high morbidity and mortality. Objective: To evaluate the cost utility of IRT vs matched sibling donor (MSD) and matched unrelated donor (MUD) HSCT to treat patients with agammaglobulinemia in the US. Design, Setting, and Participants: This economic evaluation used Markov analysis to model the base-case scenario of a patient aged 12 months with congenital agammaglobulinemia receiving lifelong IRT vs MSD or MUD HSCT. Costs, probabilities, and quality-of-life measures were derived from the literature. Microsimulations estimated premature deaths for each strategy in a virtual cohort. One-way sensitivity and probabilistic sensitivity analyses evaluated uncertainty around parameter estimates performed from a societal perspective over a 100-year time horizon. The threshold for cost-effective care was set at $100000 per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY). This study was conducted from 2020 across a 100-year time horizon. Exposures: Immunoglobulin replacement therapy vs MSD or MUD HSCT for treatment of congenital agammaglobulinemia Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary outcomes were incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) expressed in 2020 US dollars per QALY gained and premature deaths associated with each strategy. Results: In this economic evaluation of patients with congenital agammaglobulinemia, lifelong IRT cost more than HSCT ($1512946 compared with $563776 [MSD] and $637036 [MUD]) and generated similar QALYs (20.61 vs 17.25 [MSD] and 17.18 [MUD]). Choosing IRT over MSD or MUD HSCT yielded ICERs of $282166 per QALY gained over MSD and $255633 per QALY gained over MUD HSCT, exceeding the US willingness-to-pay threshold of $100000/QALY. However, IRT prevented at least 2488 premature deaths per 10000 microsimulations compared with HSCT. When annual IRT price was reduced from $60145 to below $29469, IRT became the cost-effective strategy. Findings remained robust in sensitivity and probabilistic sensitivity analyses. Conclusions and Relevance: In the US, IRT is more expensive than HSCT for agammaglobulinemia treatment. The findings of this study suggest that IRT prevents more premature deaths but does not substantially increase quality of life relative to HSCT. Reducing US IRT cost by 51% to a value similar to IRT prices in countries implementing value-based pricing may render it the more cost-effective strategy..] you can assume that [Immunoglobulin replacement therapy for agammaglobulinemia treatment substantially increases quality of life relative to hematopoietic stem cell transplant.].

Question: Given [Reversal activity and toxicity of heparin-binding copolymer after subcutaneous administration of enoxaparin in mice. Uncontrolled bleeding after enoxaparin (ENX) is rare but may be life-threatening. The only registered antidote for ENX, protamine sulfate (PS), has 60% efficacy and can cause severe adverse side effects. We developed a diblock copolymer, heparin-binding copolymer (HBC), that reverses intravenously administered heparins. Here, we focused on the HBC inhibitory activity against subcutaneously administered ENX in healthy mice. BALB/c mice were subcutaneously injected with ENX at the dose of 5 mg/kg. After 110 min, vehicle, HBC (6.25 and 12.5 mg/kg), or PS (5 and 10 mg/kg) were administered into the tail vein. The blood was collected after 3, 10, 60, 120, 360, and 600 min after vehicle, HBC, or PS administration. The activities of antifactors Xa and IIa and biochemical parameters were measured. The main organs were collected for histological analysis. HBC at the lower dose reversed the effect of ENX on antifactor Xa activity for 10 min after antidote administration, whereas at the higher dose, HBC reversed the effect on antifactor Xa activity throughout the course of the experiment. Both doses of HBC completely reversed the effect of ENX on antifactor IIa activity. PS did not reverse antifactor Xa activity and partially reversed antifactor IIa activity. HBC modulated biochemical parameters. Histopathological analysis showed changes in the liver, lungs, and spleen of mice treated with HBC and in the lungs and heart of mice treated with PS. HBC administered in an appropriate dose might be an efficient substitute for PS to reverse significantly increased anticoagulant activity that may be connected with major bleeding in patients receiving ENX subcutaneously.] you can assume that [Heparin-binding copolymer is an efficient substitute for protamine sulfate to reverse significantly increased anticoagulant activity in patients receiving subcutaneous enoxaparin.].

Three new uranyl complexes [(UO2)(OAc)2(CMZ)], [(UO2)(OAc)2(MP)] and [(UO2) (OAc)2(SCZ)] were synthesized and characterized by elemental analysis, FT-IR, UV-Vis spectroscopy, powder XRD analysis, and molar conductivity. The IR analysis confirmed binding to the metal ion by the sulfur and ethoxy oxygen atoms in the carbimazole (CMZ) ligand, while in the 6-mercaptopurine (MP) ligand, the sulfur and the N7 nitrogen atom of a purine coordinated binding to the metal ion. The third ligand showed a 1:1 molar ratio and bound via sulfonamide oxygen and the nitrogen of the pyrimidine ring.

Question: Given [Life-Threatening Docetaxel Toxicity in a Patient With Reduced-Function CYP3A Variants: A Case Report. Docetaxel therapy occasionally causes severe and life-threatening toxicities. Some docetaxel toxicities are related to exposure, and inter-individual variability in exposure has been described based on genetic variation and drug-drug interactions that impact docetaxel clearance. Cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4) and CYP3A5 metabolize docetaxel into inactive metabolites, and this is the primary mode of docetaxel clearance. Supporting their role in these toxicities, increased docetaxel toxicities have been found in patients with reduced- or loss-of-function variants in CYP3A4 and CYP3A5. However, since these variants in CYP3A4 are rare, little is known about the safety of docetaxel in patients who are homozygous for the reduced-function CYP3A4 variants. Here we present a case of life-threatening (grade 4) pneumonitis, dyspnea, and neutropenia resulting from a single dose of docetaxel. This patient was (1) homozygous for CYP3A4*22, which causes reduced expression and is associated with increased docetaxel-related adverse events, (2) heterozygous for CYP3A4*3, a rare reduced-function missense variant, and (3) homozygous for CYP3A5*3, a common loss of function splicing defect that has been associated with increased docetaxel exposure and adverse events. The patient also carried functional variants in other genes involved in docetaxel pharmacokinetics that may have increased his risk of toxicity. We identified one additional CYP3A4*22 homozygote that received docetaxel in our research cohort, and present this case of severe hematological toxicity. Furthermore, the one other CYP3A4*22 homozygous patient we identified from the literature died from docetaxel toxicity. This case report provides further evidence for the need to better understand the impact of germline CYP3A variants in severe docetaxel toxicity and supports using caution when treating patients with docetaxel who have genetic variants resulting in CYP3A poor metabolizer phenotypes.] you can assume that [The impact of germline CYP3A variants on severe docetaxel toxicity is well understood.].

Methods: The Vascular Quality Initiative (VQI) registry was queried (2010-2020) to identify patients who had undergone TEVAR for ruptured and intact thoracic aortic aneurysms. The primary outcome was to identify the factors associated with ruptured thoracic aortic aneurysms. The secondary outcomes included perioperative mortality and morbidity, 5-year survival, and the identification of factors associated with adverse outcomes after TEVAR. Results: Of the 3039 patients identified with a thoracic aortic aneurysm, 2806 (92%) had undergone repair for an intact aneurysm and 233 (8%) had undergone repair for a ruptured aneurysm. Chronic kidney disease was associated with a greater odds of a presentation with a ruptured aneurysm (odds ratio [OR], 3.1; 95% confidence interval [CI], 2.0-4.9; P < .001). The factors associated with a lower odds of rupture included prior aortic aneurysm repair (OR, 0.71; 95% CI, 0.49-0.97; P = .05), prior smoker (OR, 0.36; 95% CI, 0.24-0.53; P < .001), preoperative beta-blocker therapy (OR, 0.57; 95% CI, 0.41-0.80; P = .001), and preoperative statin therapy (OR, 0.68; 95% CI, 0.49-0.94; P = .020). TEVAR for ruptured thoracic aortic aneurysms was associated with higher perioperative mortality (rupture vs intact, 27% vs 4.6%; OR, 6.6; 95% CI 4.3-10; P < .001) and the composite outcome of mortality, new dialysis, paralysis, and stroke (38% vs 9.5%; OR, 5.1; 95% CI, 3.5-7.4; P < .001). The 5-year survival was significantly lower after TEVAR for ruptured thoracic aortic aneurysms (50% vs 76%; P < .001; hazard ratio, 0.39; 95% CI, 0.29-0.52; P < .001). Preoperative statin therapy was associated with higher 5-year survival (hazard ratio, 1.3; 95% CI, 1.0-1.6; P = .021). Conclusions: TEVAR for ruptured thoracic aortic aneurysms results in increased perioperative mortality and morbidity and lower 5-year survival compared with TEVAR for intact aneurysms. Patients with prior aortic aneurysm repair, prior smoking, and preoperative beta-blocker or statin therapy were less likely to present with ruptured thoracic aneurysms.

Question: Given [Life-Threatening Docetaxel Toxicity in a Patient With Reduced-Function CYP3A Variants: A Case Report. Docetaxel therapy occasionally causes severe and life-threatening toxicities. Some docetaxel toxicities are related to exposure, and inter-individual variability in exposure has been described based on genetic variation and drug-drug interactions that impact docetaxel clearance. Cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4) and CYP3A5 metabolize docetaxel into inactive metabolites, and this is the primary mode of docetaxel clearance. Supporting their role in these toxicities, increased docetaxel toxicities have been found in patients with reduced- or loss-of-function variants in CYP3A4 and CYP3A5. However, since these variants in CYP3A4 are rare, little is known about the safety of docetaxel in patients who are homozygous for the reduced-function CYP3A4 variants. Here we present a case of life-threatening (grade 4) pneumonitis, dyspnea, and neutropenia resulting from a single dose of docetaxel. This patient was (1) homozygous for CYP3A4*22, which causes reduced expression and is associated with increased docetaxel-related adverse events, (2) heterozygous for CYP3A4*3, a rare reduced-function missense variant, and (3) homozygous for CYP3A5*3, a common loss of function splicing defect that has been associated with increased docetaxel exposure and adverse events. The patient also carried functional variants in other genes involved in docetaxel pharmacokinetics that may have increased his risk of toxicity. We identified one additional CYP3A4*22 homozygote that received docetaxel in our research cohort, and present this case of severe hematological toxicity. Furthermore, the one other CYP3A4*22 homozygous patient we identified from the literature died from docetaxel toxicity. This case report provides further evidence for the need to better understand the impact of germline CYP3A variants in severe docetaxel toxicity and supports using caution when treating patients with docetaxel who have genetic variants resulting in CYP3A poor metabolizer phenotypes.] you can infer that [The impact of germline CYP3A variants on severe docetaxel toxicity is well understood.].

To explore the therapeutic effect of amoxicillin and clavulanate potassium combined with Bazhengsan on pediatric urinary tract infection (UTI). Methods. The data of 120 UTI children treated in Wuhan Xinzhou District People's Hospital from February 2019 to February 2020 were retrospectively analyzed. They were equally split into experimental group (EG) and control group (CG) according to the order of admission. All children were treated with amoxicillin and clavulanate potassium for suspension (twice a day), and EG was additionally treated with one dose of Bazhengsan daily. Both groups were treated for 10 days. After treatment, the immune function indexes, inflammatory factor levels, and clinical efficacy were compared before and after treatment. Results. No remarkable differences in the general data such as blood routine and urine routine results were observed between the two groups before treatment (P>0.05). After treatment, EG achieved obviously better immune function indexes (P<0.001) and lower levels of inflammatory factors (P<0.05) compared with CG. Besides, the treatment effective rate in EG (96.7%) was higher than that in CG (P<0.05). Conclusion.

Question: Given [Continuous Lumbar Plexus Block under the Guidance of the "shamrock Method" Ultrasound: Analgesic Effects and Hemodynamic Effects after Total Knee Arthroplasty in Elderly Patients. Objective. To explore the effect of continuous lumbar plexus block guided by the "Shamrock method"on postoperative analgesia and hemodynamics in elderly patients after total knee arthroplasty (TKA). Methods. From January 2020 to December 2020 in our hospital, 98 patients who underwent TKA were selected. Using the random number table method, the patients were divided into two groups: a continuous lumbar plexus block group (group L), with 49 patients, and a continuous femoral nerve block group (group F), with 49 patients. The onset time and maintenance time of motor and sensory nerve blocks in patients were recorded. A visual analogue scale (VAS) was applied to assess the pain severity at 6, 12, 24, and 48 h after the operation. The VAS score (FVAS) was applied to evaluate the pain severity of the patients during 24 and 48 h after the operation and knee joint functional exercise. The levels of hemodynamic indexes such as heart rate, mean arterial pressure, and oxyhemoglobin saturation and the levels of hemorheological indexes such as plasma viscosity, high and low whole blood shear viscosity, fibrinogen, and hematocrit were detected and compared between the two groups immediately after the operation and at 12 h and 48 h after the operation, respectively. The incidence of adverse reactions induced by anesthesia was counted. Results. The onset time of motor and sensory nerve blocks in group L was lower than that in group F, and the maintenance time was higher than that in group F (P<0.05). The VAS scores of 6, 12, 24, and 48 h after operation in group L were significantly lower than those in group F (P<0.05). The FVAS scores of group L at 24 and 48 h after operation were significantly lower than those of group F (P<0.05). The heart rates of the patients in the two groups were higher at 12 h and 48 h after operation than those immediately after operation (P<0.05). The heart rates at 12 h and 48 h after operation in group L were lower than those in group F (P<0.05). The plasma viscosity, high whole blood shear viscosity, and low whole blood shear viscosity in the group L at 12 h and 48 h after operation were lower than those in group F (P<0.05). There was no significant difference in the incidence of local anesthetic poisoning, nausea, vomiting, urinary retention, pruritus, and other adverse reactions between the two groups (P>0.05). Conclusion. The "Shamrock method"ultrasound-guided continuous lumbar plexus block in elderly patients after TKA has good analgesic effect, stable hemodynamics, little influence on hemorheology, and good safety. It is of great value to enhance the surgical effect and promote postoperative rehabilitation.

The incidence of adverse reactions induced by anesthesia was counted. Results. The onset time of motor and sensory nerve blocks in group L was lower than that in group F, and the maintenance time was higher than that in group F (P<0.05). The VAS scores of 6, 12, 24, and 48 h after operation in group L were significantly lower than those in group F (P<0.05). The FVAS scores of group L at 24 and 48 h after operation were significantly lower than those of group F (P<0.05). The heart rates of the patients in the two groups were higher at 12 h and 48 h after operation than those immediately after operation (P<0.05). The heart rates at 12 h and 48 h after operation in group L were lower than those in group F (P<0.05). The plasma viscosity, high whole blood shear viscosity, and low whole blood shear viscosity in the group L at 12 h and 48 h after operation were lower than those in group F (P<0.05). There was no significant difference in the incidence of local anesthetic poisoning, nausea, vomiting, urinary retention, pruritus, and other adverse reactions between the two groups (P>0.05). Conclusion. The "Shamrock method"ultrasound-guided continuous lumbar plexus block in elderly patients after TKA has good analgesic effect, stable hemodynamics, little influence on hemorheology, and good safety. It is of great value to enhance the surgical effect and promote postoperative rehabilitation.

Question: Given [Effect of Amoxicillin and Clavulanate Potassium Combined with Bazhengsan on Pediatric Urinary Tract Infection. Objective. To explore the therapeutic effect of amoxicillin and clavulanate potassium combined with Bazhengsan on pediatric urinary tract infection (UTI). Methods. The data of 120 UTI children treated in Wuhan Xinzhou District People's Hospital from February 2019 to February 2020 were retrospectively analyzed. They were equally split into experimental group (EG) and control group (CG) according to the order of admission. All children were treated with amoxicillin and clavulanate potassium for suspension (twice a day), and EG was additionally treated with one dose of Bazhengsan daily. Both groups were treated for 10 days. After treatment, the immune function indexes, inflammatory factor levels, and clinical efficacy were compared before and after treatment. Results. No remarkable differences in the general data such as blood routine and urine routine results were observed between the two groups before treatment (P>0.05). After treatment, EG achieved obviously better immune function indexes (P<0.001) and lower levels of inflammatory factors (P<0.05) compared with CG. Besides, the treatment effective rate in EG (96.7%) was higher than that in CG (P<0.05). Conclusion. Amoxicillin and clavulanate potassium combined with Bazhengsan can improve the immune function of UTI children and reduce the levels of inflammatory factors, with remarkable effects, which should be popularized in practice.

Question: Given [Continuous Lumbar Plexus Block under the Guidance of the "shamrock Method" Ultrasound: Analgesic Effects and Hemodynamic Effects after Total Knee Arthroplasty in Elderly Patients. Objective. To explore the effect of continuous lumbar plexus block guided by the "Shamrock method"on postoperative analgesia and hemodynamics in elderly patients after total knee arthroplasty (TKA). Methods. From January 2020 to December 2020 in our hospital, 98 patients who underwent TKA were selected. Using the random number table method, the patients were divided into two groups: a continuous lumbar plexus block group (group L), with 49 patients, and a continuous femoral nerve block group (group F), with 49 patients. The onset time and maintenance time of motor and sensory nerve blocks in patients were recorded. A visual analogue scale (VAS) was applied to assess the pain severity at 6, 12, 24, and 48 h after the operation. The VAS score (FVAS) was applied to evaluate the pain severity of the patients during 24 and 48 h after the operation and knee joint functional exercise. The levels of hemodynamic indexes such as heart rate, mean arterial pressure, and oxyhemoglobin saturation and the levels of hemorheological indexes such as plasma viscosity, high and low whole blood shear viscosity, fibrinogen, and hematocrit were detected and compared between the two groups immediately after the operation and at 12 h and 48 h after the operation, respectively.

Question: Given [Metabolomics of aging in primary fibroblasts from small and large breed dogs. Among several animal groups (eutherian mammals, birds, reptiles), lifespan positively correlates with body mass over several orders of magnitude. Contradicting this pattern are domesticated dogs, with small dog breeds exhibiting significantly longer lifespans than large dog breeds. The underlying mechanisms of differing aging rates across body masses are unclear, but it is generally agreed that metabolism is a significant regulator of the aging process. Herein, we performed a targeted metabolomics analysis on primary fibroblasts isolated from small and large breed young and old dogs. Regardless of size, older dogs exhibited lower glutathione and ATP, consistent with a role for oxidative stress and bioenergetic decline in aging. Furthermore, several size-specific metabolic patterns were observed with aging, including the following: (i) An apparent defect in the lower half of glycolysis in large old dogs at the level of pyruvate kinase. (ii) Increased glutamine anaplerosis into the TCA cycle in large old dogs. (iii) A potential defect in coenzyme A biosynthesis in large old dogs. (iv) Low nucleotide levels in small young dogs that corrected with age. (v) An age-dependent increase in carnitine in small dogs that was absent in large dogs. Overall, these data support the hypothesis that alterations in metabolism may underlie the different lifespans of small vs. large breed dogs, and further work in this area may afford potential therapeutic strategies to improve the lifespan of large dogs.] you can assume that [The lifespan difference between small and large breed dogs does not result from alterations in metabolism.].

Question: Given [Corticosteroid and immunosuppressant therapy for cardiac sarcoidosis: A systematic review. BACKGROUND: Corticosteroid therapy for the treatment of clinically manifest cardiac sarcoidosis is generally recommended. Our group previously systematically reviewed the data in 2013; since then, there has been increasing quality and quantity of data and also interest in nonsteroid agents. METHODS AND RESULTS: Studies were identified from MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane Controlled Trials Register, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, and the National Institutes of Health Clini calTr ials.gov database. The quality of included articles was rated using Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network 50. Outcomes examined were atrioventricular conduction, left ventricular function, ventricular arrhythmias, and mortality. A total of 3527 references were retrieved, and 34 publications met the inclusion criteria. There were no randomized trials, and only 2 studies were rated good quality. In the 34 reports (total of 1297 patients), 1125 patients received corticosteroids, 235 received additional or other immunosuppressant therapy, and 97 patients received no therapy. There were 178 patients treated for atrioventricular conduction disease, with 76/178 (42.7%) improving. In contrast, 21 patients were not treated with corticosteroids and/or immunosuppressant therapy, and none of them improved. Therapy was associated with the prevention of deterioration in left ventricular function. A total of 8 publications reported on ventricular arrhythmia burden, and 19 reported on mortality; the data quality was too limited to draw conclusions for the latter 2 outcomes.

Question: Given [Outcomes of patients with oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma treated with induction chemotherapy followed by concurrent chemoradiation compared with those treated with concurrent chemoradiation. Background: Induction chemotherapy (IC) has been associated with a decreased risk of distant metastasis in locally advanced head and neck squamous cell carcinoma. However, its role in the treatment of oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (OPSCC) is not well established. Methods: The outcomes of patients with OPSCC treated with IC followed by concurrent chemoradiation (CRT) were compared with the outcomes of those treated with CRT alone. The primary outcome was overall survival (OS), and the secondary end points were the times to locoregional and distant recurrence. Results: In an existing database, 585 patients met the inclusion criteria: 137 received IC plus CRT, and 448 received CRT. Most patients were positive for human papillomavirus (HPV; 90.9%). Patients receiving IC were more likely to present with a higher T stage, a higher N stage, and low neck disease. The 3-year OS rate was significantly lower in patients receiving IC (75.7%) versus CRT alone (92.9%). In a multicovariate analysis, receipt of IC (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR], 3.4; P <.001), HPV tumor status (aHR, 0.36; P =.002), and receipt of concurrent cetuximab (aHR, 2.7; P =.002) were independently associated with OS. The risk of distant metastasis was also significantly higher in IC patients (aHR, 2.8; P =.001), whereas an HPV-positive tumor status (aHR, 0.44; P =.032) and completion of therapy (aHR, 0.51; P =.034) were associated with a lower risk of distant metastasis. In HPV-positive patients, IC remained associated with distant metastatic progression (aHR, 2.6; P =.004) but not OS. Conclusions: In contrast to prior studies, IC was independently associated with worse OS and a higher risk of distant metastasis in patients with OPSCC.

Question: Given [Cost Utility of Lifelong Immunoglobulin Replacement Therapy vs Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplant to Treat Agammaglobulinemia. Importance: Lifelong immunoglobulin replacement therapy (IRT) is standard-of-care treatment for congenital agammaglobulinemia but accrues high annual costs ($30000-$90000 per year) and decrements to quality of life over patients' life spans. Hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) offers an alternative 1-time therapy, but has high morbidity and mortality. Objective: To evaluate the cost utility of IRT vs matched sibling donor (MSD) and matched unrelated donor (MUD) HSCT to treat patients with agammaglobulinemia in the US. Design, Setting, and Participants: This economic evaluation used Markov analysis to model the base-case scenario of a patient aged 12 months with congenital agammaglobulinemia receiving lifelong IRT vs MSD or MUD HSCT. Costs, probabilities, and quality-of-life measures were derived from the literature. Microsimulations estimated premature deaths for each strategy in a virtual cohort. One-way sensitivity and probabilistic sensitivity analyses evaluated uncertainty around parameter estimates performed from a societal perspective over a 100-year time horizon. The threshold for cost-effective care was set at $100000 per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY). This study was conducted from 2020 across a 100-year time horizon. Exposures: Immunoglobulin replacement therapy vs MSD or MUD HSCT for treatment of congenital agammaglobulinemia Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary outcomes were incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) expressed in 2020 US dollars per QALY gained and premature deaths associated with each strategy. Results: In this economic evaluation of patients with congenital agammaglobulinemia, lifelong IRT cost more than HSCT ($1512946 compared with $563776 [MSD] and $637036 [MUD]) and generated similar QALYs (20.61 vs 17.25 [MSD] and 17.18 [MUD]). Choosing IRT over MSD or MUD HSCT yielded ICERs of $282166 per QALY gained over MSD and $255633 per QALY gained over MUD HSCT, exceeding the US willingness-to-pay threshold of $100000/QALY. However, IRT prevented at least 2488 premature deaths per 10000 microsimulations compared with HSCT. When annual IRT price was reduced from $60145 to below $29469, IRT became the cost-effective strategy. Findings remained robust in sensitivity and probabilistic sensitivity analyses. Conclusions and Relevance: In the US, IRT is more expensive than HSCT for agammaglobulinemia treatment. The findings of this study suggest that IRT prevents more premature deaths but does not substantially increase quality of life relative to HSCT. Reducing US IRT cost by 51% to a value similar to IRT prices in countries implementing value-based pricing may render it the more cost-effective strategy..] you can assume that [Immunoglobulin replacement therapy for agammaglobulinemia treatment substantially increases quality of life relative to hematopoietic stem cell transplant.].

The threshold for cost-effective care was set at $100000 per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY). This study was conducted from 2020 across a 100-year time horizon. Exposures: Immunoglobulin replacement therapy vs MSD or MUD HSCT for treatment of congenital agammaglobulinemia Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary outcomes were incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) expressed in 2020 US dollars per QALY gained and premature deaths associated with each strategy. Results: In this economic evaluation of patients with congenital agammaglobulinemia, lifelong IRT cost more than HSCT ($1512946 compared with $563776 [MSD] and $637036 [MUD]) and generated similar QALYs (20.61 vs 17.25 [MSD] and 17.18 [MUD]). Choosing IRT over MSD or MUD HSCT yielded ICERs of $282166 per QALY gained over MSD and $255633 per QALY gained over MUD HSCT, exceeding the US willingness-to-pay threshold of $100000/QALY. However, IRT prevented at least 2488 premature deaths per 10000 microsimulations compared with HSCT. When annual IRT price was reduced from $60145 to below $29469, IRT became the cost-effective strategy. Findings remained robust in sensitivity and probabilistic sensitivity analyses. Conclusions and Relevance: In the US, IRT is more expensive than HSCT for agammaglobulinemia treatment. The findings of this study suggest that IRT prevents more premature deaths but does not substantially increase quality of life relative to HSCT. Reducing US IRT cost by 51% to a value similar to IRT prices in countries implementing value-based pricing may render it the more cost-effective strategy..] you can imply that [Immunoglobulin replacement therapy for agammaglobulinemia treatment substantially increases quality of life relative to hematopoietic stem cell transplant.].

Question: Given [Identifying high dose neostigmine as a risk factor for post-operative respiratory complications: A case-control study. Background: Neostigmine, an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor, is used to reverse the effects of non-depolarizing neuromuscular blocking agents. Inappropriate dosing of neostigmine can lead to post-operative respiratory complications. Post-operative respiratory complications are associated with major morbidity and mortality. The purpose of this case-control study was to determine neuromuscular blockade-related risk factors associated with post-operative respiratory complications (specifically, reintubation, respiratory insufficiency, hypoxia, and/or aspiration). Methods: We performed an Institutional Review Board-approved case-control study of all patients who underwent a general anesthetic requiring neuromuscular blockade at Tufts Medical Center between March 22, 2013 and June 1, 2019. Cases were patients who experienced post-operative complications. We identified 58 controls and 116 cases from a database of 130,178 patients during the 74-month study period. Results: After adjusting for covariates, the administration of high dose neostigmine (> 60 mg per kg ideal body weight) was associated with increased odds of post-operative respiratory complications (odds ratio = 8.2; 95% CI: 2.5-26.6, P < 0.001). Rocuronium dose and the use of train-of-four peripheral nerve stimulator were not associated with post-operative respiratory complications. Conclusions: High dose neostigmine was identified as an independent risk factor for post-operative respiratory complications.

Question: Given [Cost impact analysis of novel host-response diagnostic for patients with community-acquired pneumonia in the emergency department. Background: There is significant over-prescription of antibiotics for suspected community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) patients as bacterial and viral pathogens are difficult to differentiate. To address this issue, a host response diagnostic called MeMed BV (MMBV) was developed that accurately differentiates bacterial from viral infection at the point of need by integrating measurements of multiple biomarkers. A literature-based cost-impact model was developed that compared the cost impact and clinical benefits between using the standard of care diagnostics combined with MMBV relative to standard of care diagnostics alone. Methods: The patient population was stratified according to the pneumonia severity index, and cost savings were considered from payer and provider perspectives. Four scenarios were considered. The main analysis considers the cost impact of differences in antibiotic stewardship and resulting adverse events. The first, second, and third scenarios combine the impacts on antibiotic stewardship with changes in hospital admission probability, length of hospital stay and diagnosis related group (DRG) reallocation, and hospital admission probability, length of stay, and DRG reallocation in combination, respectively. Results: The main analysis results show overall per-patient savings of $37 for payers and $223 for providers. Scenarios 1, 2, and 3 produced savings of $137, $189, and $293 for payers, and $339, $713, and $809 for providers, respectively. Limitations: Models are simulations of real-world clinical processes, and are not sensitive to variations in clinical practice driven by differences in physician practice styles, differences in facility-level practice patterns, and patient comorbidities expected to exacerbate the clinical impact of CAP. Hospital models are limited to costs and do not consider differences in revenue associated with each approach.

To study the demographic characteristics (age, parity), risk factors, treatment modalities, and pregnancy outcomes in women with thrombotic microangiopathy in Ain Shams University Maternity Hospital over a 5-year period. Patients and methods. This study was retrospectively conducted at Ain Shams University Maternity Hospital and included 419 patients; the study population were pregnant women admitted to the hospital from January 2014 to December 2018, with pregnancy-associated thrombotic microangiopathy. The study was performed through revising the medical records in the archive and the ICU and contacting the patients to assess demographic data, risk factors, presentation of the patient, type of the syndrome, and the maternal and fetal outcome. Results. HELLP syndrome was the most common pregnancy complication. In most of cases, women delivered by cesarean section (72.1%). Complications included chronic hypertension (CHTN), acute kidney injury (AKI), chronic kidney injury (CKI). Maternal mortality was significantly more frequent in hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS). Maternal mortality was 8.8 %, and neonatal mortality was 26.7%. Most of women were admitted to the ICU (87.1%). Conclusion. Thrombotic microangiopathy in pregnancy continues to pose a large challenge to obstetricians, immunologists, and nephrologists due to potential risks and complications.

Question: Given [Cost-effectiveness of drug-management of hypertension among patients in selected secondary facilities in Nigeria: Empirical evidence for rational prescription choices. Background: The financial burden of managing hypertension in developing countries, where most of healthcare is funded out-of-pocket, is huge and poor patients cannot sustainably afford it. This is a challenge for most people, especially in sub-Sa-haran Africa with poor health indices, and this informed the investigation of the cost-effectiveness of anti-hypertensive drugs. Methodology: This was essentially a before-and-after study without control, in which blood pressure was assessed after commencing treatment with anti-hypertensive drugs among hypertensive patients. A systematic sampling technique was employed to recruit 320 participants from new patients attending cardiology clinic and admitted into the wards in four secondary health facilities offering specialized medical services in Nigeria. Results: The median cost of drug treatment of hypertension per week was N977.50; this cost was much lower for monotherapy than combined therapy. Similarly, the median costs of treatment per decrease in systolic and diastolic blood pressures were higher with combined therapy than monothe-rapy. The median cost of treatment per decrease in systolic blood pressure was higher than diastolic pressure. Diuretics had the most cost per decrease in diastolic blood pressure, while ACEI had the highest costs per decrease in systolic blood pressure and the highest cost per week. The lowest cost per week was recorded for beta-blockers, which also had the lowest cost per decrease in diastolic blood pressure and similar to the average cost per unit decrease in systolic blood pressure for centrally acting drugs. Conclusion: There was a significant improvement in blood pressure three months following the start of anti-hypertensive drugs.

Question: Given [Costs of care for low-energy extremity gunshot injuries are reduced with standardized treatment. Objectives: (1) To determine the overall treatment costs associated with isolated low-energy gunshot wounds (GSWs) to the extremity and (2) to estimate cost savings associated with a single-dose IV antibiotic strategy administered in the emergency room for patients with simple GSWs. Design: Retrospective review. Setting: Level I trauma center. Patients/Participants: Patients (N = 380) with extremity-only GSW injuries from 2010 to 2015 were retrospectively reviewed. Treatment was recorded including type and duration of antibiotics, admission, and surgical intervention. Main Outcome Measures: Costs were calculated including facility services in the operating room and hospital. Results: There were 460 GSWs in 380 patients with a mean age of 30 years old. There were 309 admissions, 273 operations performed, and 1010 days of antibiotics prescribed. The total inpatient facility cost to treat all patients was $1,701,154. Among 179 patients who could be treated by the single-dose antibiotic care pathway for simple GSWs, 132 patients (73%) received additional treatment with 108 hospital admissions, 26 debridement surgeries, and 322 days of additional oral and/or IV antibiotics. The single-dose antibiotic care pathway would have saved an average of $1436 per patient with simple GSWs in actual facility expenses. Conclusions: The overall cost associated with isolated low-energy GSWs to the extremity is high. Limiting antibiotics to a single IV dose in the emergency room can reduce treatment expenses substantially for patients with simple GSWs.

Question: Given [Costs of care for low-energy extremity gunshot injuries are reduced with standardized treatment. Objectives: (1) To determine the overall treatment costs associated with isolated low-energy gunshot wounds (GSWs) to the extremity and (2) to estimate cost savings associated with a single-dose IV antibiotic strategy administered in the emergency room for patients with simple GSWs. Design: Retrospective review. Setting: Level I trauma center. Patients/Participants: Patients (N = 380) with extremity-only GSW injuries from 2010 to 2015 were retrospectively reviewed. Treatment was recorded including type and duration of antibiotics, admission, and surgical intervention. Main Outcome Measures: Costs were calculated including facility services in the operating room and hospital. Results: There were 460 GSWs in 380 patients with a mean age of 30 years old. There were 309 admissions, 273 operations performed, and 1010 days of antibiotics prescribed. The total inpatient facility cost to treat all patients was $1,701,154. Among 179 patients who could be treated by the single-dose antibiotic care pathway for simple GSWs, 132 patients (73%) received additional treatment with 108 hospital admissions, 26 debridement surgeries, and 322 days of additional oral and/or IV antibiotics. The single-dose antibiotic care pathway would have saved an average of $1436 per patient with simple GSWs in actual facility expenses. Conclusions: The overall cost associated with isolated low-energy GSWs to the extremity is high. Limiting antibiotics to a single IV dose in the emergency room can reduce treatment expenses substantially for patients with simple GSWs.

Question: Given [Serous macular detachments associated with topical travoprost. Here is presented a unique case of bilateral serous macular detachments as a side effect of topical travoprost (0.004%) therapy. Only three other cases in the literature have definitively associated this side effect with other topical prostaglandins. The aetiological and pathophysiological pathways remain to be clearly elucidated but are potentially related to increased choroidal vascular permeability. In this case, the subretinal fluid resolved rapidly and completely after cessation of travoprost drops, showing it to be a reversible pathology similar to prostaglandin-associated cystoid macular oedema. This uncommon association is therefore important to consider in the differential diagnosis of serous macular detachment. Increasing ophthalmic awareness could help to prevent unnecessary investigations in undifferentiated patients without other guiding historical or examination features. This may save time and expense for the patient and health systems.

Question: Given [Covid-19 outbreak in italy: Report on the first 124 consecutive patients treated at home. North Italy emerged as an epicenter of COVID-19 in the Western world. The majority of studies of patients with COVID-19 have focused on hospitalized patients, and data on early outpatient treatment are limited. This research retrospectively examines consecutive symptomatic adults who did not present to a hospital but who experience laboratory confirmed (nasopharyngeal swabs) or probable COVID-19 infection. From March 12 to April 12, 2020, 124 consecutive patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 infection (84%) or with epidemiologically linked exposure to a person with confirmed infection (16%) were managed at home. The diagnosis of pneumonia was made with a portable ultrasound. COVID-19 treatment was based on low-dose hydroxychloroquine with or without darunavir/cobicistat or azithromycin and enoxaparine for bedridden patients. The patients were monitored by telemedicine. The primary endpoints were clinical improvement or hospitalization, and the secondary endpoints were mortality at day 30 and at day 60. Forty-seven (37.9%) patients had mild COVID-19 infection, 44 (35.5%) had moderate COVID-19 infection, and 33 (26.6%) had severe COVID-19 infection. Four patients (3.2%) were hospitalized and there were no deaths at day 30 and at day 60. Only mild side effects were reported. Early home treatment of COVID-19 patients resulted in a low hospitalization rate with no deaths, with the limitations of the small sample size and that it was conducted within a single geographic area.

Question: Given [Blinatumomab-related pneumatosis intestinalis in a pediatric patient with relapsed acute lymphoblastic leukemia: A case report. Introduction: Pneumatosis intestinalis is characterized by air in the subserosal or submucosal layer of the intestine, with the severity ranging from mild and asymptomatic to symptomatic with serious conditions such as intestinal ischemia and perforation requiring surgery. Although several etiologies, including those from conventional chemotherapy agents and molecular target agents, have been suggested, blinatumomab-related pneumatosis intestinalis is quite rare. Case report: An 11-year-old girl with history of B-cell ALL presented with bone marrow relapse 3 years after completion of initial chemotherapy. Reinduction chemotherapy and blinatumomab as post-reinduction consolidation were initiated. On day 28 of blinatumomab therapy, pneumatosis intestinalis from the ascending colon to the hepatic flexure was found incidentally on abdominal computed tomography. Management and outcome: After withholding blinatumomab therapy for 1 month, pneumatosis intestinalis improved significantly without abnormal gastrointestinal symptoms. Blinatumomab was resumed and safely completed. The computed tomography performed 4 months later showed complete resolution of pneumatosis intestinalis. The patient has been in good condition for over 1 year to date. Discussion: To our knowledge, this is the first case report of pneumatosis intestinalis after blinatumomab therapy in a pediatric patient with relapsed precursor B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia.

Importance: An outbreak of COVID-19-associated rhino-orbitocerebral mucormycosis (CAM) has occurred in many parts of the world. Although the clinical profile and risk factors for CAM have been studied, cumulative mortality and its risk factors have not. Objective: To report the cumulative mortality rates at different times in cases with CAM and identify risk factors for CAM-associated mortality. Design, Setting, and Participants: This retrospective case-control study was conducted from March 1 to May 30, 2021, in a tertiary care multispecialty hospital in western India. All patients diagnosed with CAM and with a minimum follow-up of 30 days or those who died before 30 days due to CAM were included. Main Outcomes and Measure: Cumulative mortality in CAM using survival analysis. Results: A total of 73 consecutive patients with CAM with a mean (SD) age of 53.5 (12.5) years were included in the analysis, of whom 48 (66%) were men. CAM developed at a median of 28 (IQR, 15-45; range, 4-90) days after recovery from COVID-19. Of the 73 patients with CAM, 26 (36%) died; the cumulative probability of death was 26% (95% CI, 16%-41%) at day 7 and doubled to 53% (95% CI, 39%-69%) at day 21. Sinus debridement was performed in 18 of 51 patients (35%), and 5 of 52 (10%) underwent exenteration, whereas intravenous lyophilized amphotericin B was administered to 48 patients (66%). A multivariate Cox proportional hazards regression analysis showed that receiving mechanical ventilation in the past was associated with a nearly 9-fold increased risk of death (hazard ratio [HR], 8.98; 95% CI, 2.13-38.65; P =.003), and patients who had visual acuity of light perception or better had a 46% lower risk of death (HR, 0.56; 95% CI, 0.32-0.98; P =.04). Intravenous amphotericin B administration was associated with a reduced rate of exenteration (0 vs 5 of 25 [20%]; P <.001). On multivariate analysis, those who received intravenous amphotericin B had a 69% reduced risk of death (HR, 0.31; 95% CI, 0.06-1.43; P =.13). Conclusions and Relevance: These findings suggest that the mortality rate after rhino-orbitocerebral mucormycosis is high and that a subgroup of patients with severe COVID-19 or presenting with severe orbital disease are more likely to die within 10 days of admission..] you can assume that [COVID-19-associated rhino-orbitocerebral mucormycosis has a high mortality rate.].

Results indicated that opioid misuse is associated with greater tobacco (13% of variance), alcohol (27% of variance), and cannabis (22% of variance) problems, as well as anxiety (26% of variance) and depressive symptoms (26% of variance). These results highlight the potential importance of opioid misuse in terms of concurrent substance and mental health problems among smokers with chronic pain. Future work is needed to explicate directionality and temporal ordering in the observed relations.] you can imply that [Opioid misuse causes chronic pain in smokers.].

Question: Given [Current and Future Options of Haemophilia A Treatments. Introduction: The standard treatment of hemophilia A consists of the prophylactic administration of a coagulation factor concentrate, to be administered intravenously several times a week. Newly approved factor concentrates and non-factor products reduce the frequency of injection and offer better protection against bleeding. Areas covered: New treatment options for hemophilia A are either coagulation factor concentrates based on innovative active principles extending half-life (EHL) or non-factor products allowing subcutaneous application with an extended half-life, so that their broader application only needs to be made every one to four weeks. Other new therapeutic options are still in clinical studies, such as the inhibition of TFPI (tissue factor pathway inhibitor) or small interfering mRNA molecule against antithrombin and gene therapy for hemophilia A. Expert opinion: It can be expected that patients with hemophilia will benefit significantly from the new treatment options and that the protection against bleeding and joint damage as well as the quality of life will increase. The availability of alternatives to classical replacement therapy will require the development of treatment algorithms for patients with hemophilia. It is still unclear to what extent factor substitution will be challenged by the new therapies as first-line therapy.] you can imply that [Classical replacement therapy will be challenged by the new therapies as first-line therapy for hemophilia A.].

Question: Given [Retrospective analysis of the incidence and severity of acute kidney injury (AKI) in patients with head and neck cancer receiving weekly cisplatin with radiotherapy (RAISe-AKI). Introduction: Low-dose, weekly cisplatin (40 mg/m2) regimens are currently utilized at Eskenazi Health in Indianapolis, Indiana for the treatment of head and neck cancer due to enhanced tolerability. This retrospective analysis analyzes the incidence, severity, and risk factors for AKI in patients who received this regimen. Methods: A retrospective chart review was conducted including patients with head and neck cancer treated with weekly, low dose cisplatin (40 mg/m2) with concurrent radiotherapy (RT). From this criteria, 22 patients were identified and included in the final analysis. AKI was defined by the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 4.03. Results: Of the 22 patients included, 12 (54.5%) experienced AKI, with 10 patients (45.5%) experiencing grade 1 AKI and 2 patients (9.1%) experiencing grade 2 AKI. Six patients (27.3%) required dose adjustments or delays due to renal adverse events, all of which had initial cisplatin total weekly doses of >70 mg. Those receiving a total weekly cisplatin dose of >70 mg were found to have a higher risk of developing an episode of AKI compared to the group receiving <70 mg (p = 0.029). Conclusion: This analysis showed patients receiving weekly doses >70 mg of cisplatin as their initial treatment dose for head and neck cancer were more likely to experience AKI. There are inconsistencies in the frequency of AKI in our study compared to published literature; however, this comparison is difficult due to the small sample size of our trial.

Question: Given [Soluble PD-L1 as an early marker of progressive disease on nivolumab. Background Soluble PD-L1 (sPD-L1) has been associated with worse prognosis in numerous solid tumors. We determined sPD-L1 levels before and during nivolumab treatment in two prospective clinical trials of metastatic clear cell renal cell carcinoma (RCC) and melanoma patients, and investigated its relationship to clinical factors, biomarkers, and outcome. Methods Using a new Single Molecule Array assay, serum sPD-L1 level were determined in RCC (CheckMate 009, n=91) and melanoma (CheckMate 038-Part 1, n=78) prior to, and at two time points on treatment. Gene expression data was obtained from biopsies taken prior to, and at day 28 on treatment. Results were integrated with clinical variables, tumor PD-L1 status from immuno-histochemistry, and genomic mutation status. Results In RCC patients, sPD-L1 levels were higher in patients with progressive disease as their best response. For both RCC and melanoma patients, progressive or stable disease was associated with an increase in sPD-L1 on nivolumab therapy, whereas mean sPD-L1 levels did not change or declined in patients with objective responses. By categorizing RCC patients into transcriptomic molecular subtypes, we identified a subgroup where the associations between sPD-L1 and progressive disease were particularly evident. In baseline biopsies, we identified six biological processes that were associated with sPD-L1 level in both RCC and melanoma: higher sPD-L1 is associated with lower tumor expression of the Hallmark gene sets 'hypoxia', 'fatty acid metabolism', 'glycolysis', 'MTORC1 signaling' and 'androgen response', and with higher expression of 'KRAS signaling-Down'. Conclusion Baseline and on-therapy sPD-L1 levels in RCC have the potential to predict progressive disease on PD-1 inhibitor nivolumab. In a hypothesis-generating analysis of tumor gene expression, high baseline sPD-L1 is associated with a tumor metabolic state reflecting potentially targetable processes in both melanoma and RCC. In both trials, we observed associations between change in sPD-L1 on treatment and outcome metrics. sPD-L1 levels may further refine a nivolumab-refractory subtype of RCC within transcriptionally based subtypes of RCC.

Question: Given [Cyclophosphamide bioactivation pharmacogenetics in breast cancer patients. Purpose: Genetic variation in the activation of the prodrug cyclophosphamide (CP) by cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes has been shown to influence outcomes. However, CYP are also subject to phenoconversion due to either the effects of comedications or cancer associated down-regulation of expression. The aim of this study was to assess the relationship between CP bioactivation with CYP2B6 and CYP2C19 genotype, as well as CYP2C19 phenotype, in breast cancer patients. Methods: CP and the active metabolite levels were assessed in breast cancer patients (n = 34) at cycle 1 and cycle 3 of treatment. Patients were genotyped for a series of SNP known to affect CYP2B6 and CYP2C19 function. The activity of CYP2C19 was also assessed using a probe drug. Results: We found a significant linear gene-dose relationship with CYP2B6 coding SNP and formation of 4-hydroxycyclophosphamide. A possible association with CYP2C19 null genotype at cycle 1 was obscured at cycle 3 due to the substantial intra-individual change in CP bioactivation on subsequent dosing. Conclusion: Comedications may be the cause for this inter-occasion variation in bioactivation of cyclophosphamide and the ensuing phenoconversion may account for the conflicting reports in the literature about the relationship between CYP2C19 genotype and CP bioactivation pharmacokinetics.

Radiation-induced cardiopulmonary injuries are the most common and intractable side effects that are entwined with radiotherapy for thorax cancers. However, the therapeutic options for such complications have yielded disappointing results in clinical applications. Here, we reported that gut microbiota-derived L-Histidine and its secondary metabolite imidazole propionate (ImP) fought against radiation-induced cardiopulmonary injury in an entiric flora-dependent manner in mouse models. Local chest irradiation decreased the level of L-Histidine in fecal pellets, which was increased following fecal microbiota transplantation. L-Histidine replenishment via an oral route retarded the pathological process of lung and heart tissues and improved lung respiratory and heart systolic function following radiation exposure. L-Histidine preserved the gut bacterial taxonomic proportions shifted by total chest irradiation but failed to perform radioprotection in gut microbiota-deleted mice. ImP, the downstream metabolite of L-Histidine, accumulated in peripheral blood and lung tissues following L-Histidine replenishment and protected against radiation-induced lung and heart toxicity. Orally gavaged ImP could not enter into the circulatory system in mice through an antibiotic cocktail treatment.

We report the unusual case of a 5-year-old migrant boy from a rural area of Morocco with an almost-giant lung hydatid cyst that was an incidental finding on a chest X-ray performed during routine visa procedures. Echinococcus granulosus serology test was initially negative with subsequent positive seroconversion. Albendazole was started at 4 weeks before surgery and maintained for 4 months, with a favourable outcome. Cystic echinococcosis (CE) is considered a neglected tropical disease and affects more than one million people worldwide, mostly from a lower socioeconomic background. Preventive measures have been limited in underdeveloped regions. Children with CE are especially vulnerable, due not only to the high pathogenic potential of the disease but also to their frequent involvement in challenging socioeconomic situations, including migration. The incidence of CE is increasing in Europe because of high immigration flows from endemic countries. Nevertheless, CE is not covered by current migrant screening protocols.] you can imply that [High immigration flows from endemic countries increase the incidence of cystic echinococcosis in Europe.].

Question: Given [Clustering and Erratic Movement Patterns of Syringe-Injected versus Mosquito-Inoculated Malaria Sporozoites Underlie Decreased Infectivity. Malaria vaccine candidates based on live, attenuated sporozoites have led to high levels of protection. However, their efficacy critically depends on the sporozoites' ability to reach and infect the host liver. Administration via mosquito inoculation is by far the most potent method for inducing immunity but highly impractical. Here, we observed that intradermal syringe-injected Plasmodium berghei sporozoites (syrSPZ) were 3-fold less efficient in migrating to and infecting mouse liver than mosquito-inoculated sporozoites (msqSPZ). This was related to a clustered dermal distribution (2-fold-decreased median distance between syrSPZ and msqSPZ) and, more importantly, a 1.4-fold (significantly)-slower and more erratic movement pattern. These erratic movement patterns were likely caused by alteration of dermal tissue morphology (.15-mm intercellular gaps) due to injection of fluid and may critically decrease sporozoite infectivity. These results suggest that novel microvolume-based administration technologies hold promise for replicating the success of mosquito-inoculated live, attenuated sporozoite vaccines. IMPORTANCE Malaria still causes a major burden on global health and the economy. The efficacy of live, attenuated malaria sporozoites as vaccine candidates critically depends on their ability to migrate to and infect the host liver. This work sheds light on the effect of different administration routes on sporozoite migration. We show that the delivery of sporozoites via mosquito inoculation is more efficient than syringe injection; however, this route of administration is highly impractical for vaccine purposes. Using confocal microscopy and automated imaging software, we demonstrate that syringe-injected sporozoites do cluster, move more slowly, and display more erratic movement due to alterations in tissue morphology. These findings indicate that microneedle-based engineering solutions hold promise for replicating the success of mosquito-inoculated live, attenuated sporozoite vaccines.] you can assume that [Intradermal syringe-injected live attenuated Malaria sporozoites have no alterations in tissue morphology.].

Question: Given [D-chiro-inositol induces ovulation in non-polycystic ovary syndrome (Pcos), non-insulin-resistant young women, likely by modulating aromatase expression: A report of 2 cases. Objective: Unknown etiology Background: Anovulation consists in the lack of oocyte release during the menstrual cycle, leading to an irregular menstrual cycle. Untreated chronic anovulation is one of the major causes of female infertility and can induce hypoestrogenism. Different etiological factors can contribute to anovulation; therefore, the clinical approaches to manage this condition should take into account the specific patient characteristics. Oral ovulation-inducing agents are first-line treatments for most anovulatory patients. Drugs used include selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs) such as clomiphene citrate and aromatase inhibitors (AIs) such as letrozole. The latter, in particular, halts the estrogen biosynthesis by blocking the activity of steroidogenic enzyme aromatase, which catalyzes the conversion of androgens to estrogens. Similarly, d-chiro-inositol (DCI) modulates the activity of aromatase by reducing the corresponding gene expression, and DCI supplementation was successfully used to induce ovulation in anovulatory PCOS patients. Here, we report the use of DCI to induce ovulation in non-PCOS anovulatory oligomenorrheic women. Case Reports: Two young non-PCOS anovulatory oligomenorrheic women received treatment with high-dose (1200 mg) DCI for 6 weeks. Based on an initial evaluation, both patients had normal hormone levels and were non-insulin-resistant. Ovulation assessment was based on the increment of progesterone and LH levels, as well as on the endometrial thickening. Also, the treatment with DCI resulted in a reduction of testosterone levels relative to baseline values. Conclusions: After the 6-week treatment with 1200 mg DCI, ovulation was restored in both women, as confirmed by in-creased progesterone and LH and endometrial thickening.] you can assume that [D-chiro-inositol can induce ovulation in either polycystic ovary syndrome (Pcos) or non-PCOS anovulatory women.].

Question: Given [Description of release process of doxorubicin from modified carbon nanotubes. The article discusses the release process of doxorubicin hydrochloride (DOX) from multiwall carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs). The studies described a probable mechanism of release and actions between the surface of functionalized MWCNTs and anticancer drugs. The surface of carbon nanotubes (CNTs) has been modified via treatment in nitric acid to optimize the adsorption and release process. The modification efficiency and physicochemical properties of the MWCNTs+DOX system were analyzed by using SEM, TEM, EDS, FTIR, Raman Spectroscopy and UV-Vis methods. Based on computer simulations at pH 7.4 and the experiment at pH 5.4, the kinetics and the mechanism of DOX release from MWNT were discussed. It has been experimentally observed that the acidic pH (5.4) is appropriate for the efficient release of the drug from CNTs. It was noted that under acidic pH conditions, which is typical for the tumour microenvironment almost 90% of the drug was released in a relatively short time. The kinetics models based on different mathematical functions were used to describe the release mechanism of drugs from MWCNTs. Our studies indicated that the best fit of experimental kinetic curves of release has been observed for the Power-law model and the fitted parameters suggest that the drug release mechanism of DOX from MWCNTs is controlled by Fickian diffusion. Molecular dynamics simulations, on the other hand, have shown that in a neutral pH solution, which is close to the blood pH, the release process does not occur keeping the aggregation level constant. The presented studies have shown that MWCNTs are promising carriers of anticancer drugs that, depending on the surface modification, can exhibit different adsorption mechanisms and release.] you can assume that [The release process of doxorubicin from modified carbon nanotubes cannot be described.].

Question: Given [Description of the role of pharmacist independent double checks during cognitive order verification of outpatient parenteral anti-cancer therapy. Introduction: To describe pharmacist interventions as a result of an independent double check during cognitive order verification of outpatient parenteral anti-cancer therapy. Methods: A single-center, retrospective analysis of all individual orders for outpatient, parenteral anti-cancer agents within a hematology/oncology infusion center during a 30 day period was conducted. The primary endpoint was error identification rates during first and second verification. Secondary endpoints included the type, frequency, and severity of errors identified during second verification using a modified National Coordinating Council for Medication Error Reporting and Prevention Index. Results: A total of 1970 anti-cancer parenteral orders were screened, from which 1645 received an independent double check and were included. The number of errors identified during first and second verification were 30 (1.8%) and 10 (0.6%) respectively; second verification resulted in a 33.3% increase in corrected errors. The 10 errors identified during second verification included: four rate transcriptions to optimize pump interoperability, three rate and/or volume modifications, two dosage adjustments, and one treatment deferral due to toxicity. The severity was classified as Category A for four (40%), Category C for three (30%), and Category D for three (30%) errors. This correlated to a low capacity for harm for seven (70%) and a serious capacity for three (30%) errors. Conclusions: Second verification of outpatient, parenteral anti-cancer medication orders resulted in a 33.3% increase in corrected errors. Three errors detected during second verification were determined to have a serious capacity for harm, supporting the value of independent double checks during pharmacist cognitive order verification.] you can imply that [Second verification of outpatient parenteral anti-cancer medication cognitive orders does not result in an increase in corrected errors.].

Question: Given [Early neonatal respiratory distress revealing meningitis caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae serotype 17F: a case report. Background: Streptococcus pneumoniae (S. pneumoniae) is the first leading cause of invasive diseases such as meningitis, bacteremia and pneumoniae in children. In this case we report an early neonatal respiratory distress revealing meningitis caused by S. pneumoniae Serotype 17F through vertical transmission, in the newborn of 3 hours of live. Case description: A male late preterm newborn was born by vaginal delivery at a gestational age of 34 weeks. At 3 hours of life, he was admitted for early moderate neonatal respiratory distress in the Neonatal Medicine and Resuscitation Service. Cerebrospinal fluid culture yielded S. pneumoniae belonging to serotype 17F while the blood culture was negative. The same pneumococcal serotype was recovered from the high vaginal swab of the mother. Both isolates were found susceptible to all tested antibiotics except tetracycline and chloramphenicol to which the strain was resistant. Antibiotherapy management of the child included ceftriaxone at 150mg/kg/day for 21 days, in combination with gentamycin at 5 mg/kg/day for 5 days. ciprofloxacin was added at 40mg/kg/day in two doses for a period of three weeks as the baby presented a hydrocephalus.

Question: Given [Desmopressin treatment in dipsogenic form of primary polydipsia: Keep serum osmolality marginally below thirst threshold for symptomatic relief. Dipsogenic polydipsia (DP), a distinct variety of primary polydipsia, is characterised by selective diminution of osmotic threshold for thirst leading to polydipsia and subsequent hypotonic polyuria. Seen in patients without underlying psychiatric illness, DP closely mimics central diabetes insipidus (CDI), making it difficult for clinicians to discriminate these two conditions from each other. Carefully performed osmotic stimulation study, incorporating objective assessment of threshold for thirst and arginine vasopressin (AVP) release is the key to differentiate DP from CDI or psychogenic polydipsia, also termed compulsive water drinking (CWD). Low thirst threshold and high AVP release threshold separate DP from CDI and CWD, respectively. Unlike CWD, desmopressin may be successfully used in DP without concomitant risk of hyponatremia. We describe a child, in whom an initial diagnosis of partial CDI was subsequently revised to DP based on osmotic stimulation test. The child was treated successfully with desmopressin therapy with a target to keep serum osmolality close to thirst threshold.

Question: Given [Blinatumomab-related pneumatosis intestinalis in a pediatric patient with relapsed acute lymphoblastic leukemia: A case report. Introduction: Pneumatosis intestinalis is characterized by air in the subserosal or submucosal layer of the intestine, with the severity ranging from mild and asymptomatic to symptomatic with serious conditions such as intestinal ischemia and perforation requiring surgery. Although several etiologies, including those from conventional chemotherapy agents and molecular target agents, have been suggested, blinatumomab-related pneumatosis intestinalis is quite rare. Case report: An 11-year-old girl with history of B-cell ALL presented with bone marrow relapse 3 years after completion of initial chemotherapy. Reinduction chemotherapy and blinatumomab as post-reinduction consolidation were initiated. On day 28 of blinatumomab therapy, pneumatosis intestinalis from the ascending colon to the hepatic flexure was found incidentally on abdominal computed tomography. Management and outcome: After withholding blinatumomab therapy for 1 month, pneumatosis intestinalis improved significantly without abnormal gastrointestinal symptoms. Blinatumomab was resumed and safely completed. The computed tomography performed 4 months later showed complete resolution of pneumatosis intestinalis.

Methodology: This was essentially a before-and-after study without control, in which blood pressure was assessed after commencing treatment with anti-hypertensive drugs among hypertensive patients. A systematic sampling technique was employed to recruit 320 participants from new patients attending cardiology clinic and admitted into the wards in four secondary health facilities offering specialized medical services in Nigeria. Results: The median cost of drug treatment of hypertension per week was N977.50; this cost was much lower for monotherapy than combined therapy.

Question: Given [Impact of COVID-19 pandemic on TB prevention and care in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia: A retrospective database study. Objective The current COVID-19 pandemic in Ethiopia could cause severe dysfunction in tuberculosis (TB) treatment, diagnostic services, and prevention and control efforts. In this study, we evaluated the effect of COVID-19 on TB service indicators in Addis Ababa, where more than two-thirds of the country's COVID-19 morbidity was recorded. Design We performed a comparative retrospective study to evaluate the impact of COVID-19 on TB services during the pre-COVID-19 era (from April 2019 to March 2020) and the COVID-19 era (from April 2020 to March 2021) in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. We extracted data on total TB detection rate, TB treatment success rate, isoniazid prophylaxis therapy, and drug susceptibility tests and others from the health information system. Using Poisson regression, we estimated the incidence rate ratios and the absolute number difference of the indicators (number per quarter and year) in the COVID-19 and pre-COVID-19 eras. Results Compared with the pre-COVID-19 era, the total TB detection, bacteriologically confirmed TB, TB treatment success rate, latent TB infection treatment and community health workers' engagement in TB detection decreased, respectively, by 11%, 11.8%, 17%, 44.7% and 77.2% during the COVID-19 period. Rifampicin resistance increased by 27.7% during the same period. Comparative analysis showed a significant decline in these TB service indicators (p<0.001) Conclusion The COVID-19 pandemic has had a negative impact on TB service indicators in Addis Ababa. This highlights the importance of reinforcing TB services, including adopting alternative digital health technology to screen for TB and integrating TB and COVID-19 services to mitigate COVID-19's challenges to TB prevention and care.] you can assume that [The COVID-19 pandemic resulted in a significant decline in tuberculosis service indicators in Ethiopia.].

Question: Given [Difference between Acyclovir and Ganciclovir in the Treatment of Children with Epstein-Barr Virus-Associated Infectious Mononucleosis. Objective. To investigate the efficacy differences between acyclovir and ganciclovir in the treatment of children with Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)- associated infectious mononucleosis (IM). Methods. A total of 128 children with EBV-IM who were admitted to our hospital from February 2019 to February 2021 were selected and randomly divided into the acyclovir group (n = 64) and the ganciclovir group (n = 64) according to the random number table method. All the children were given symptomatic treatments such as protecting the liver and reducing fever. On this basis, the acyclovir group was given an intravenous drip of acyclovir, while the ganciclovir group was given an intravenous drip of ganciclovir. The treatment was continued for 7 days. After the treatment, the clinical efficacy, disappearance time of symptoms and signs, related blood routine indexes, EBV-DNA negative conversion rate, and the incidence of adverse reactions during the treatment were compared between the two groups. Results. After treatment, the total effective rate of the ganciclovir group (92.19%) was higher than that of the acyclovir group (73.44%) and the difference was statistically significant P<0.05. The disappearance time for the symptoms and signs of angina, fever, lymphadenopathy, hepatomegaly, and splenomegaly in the ganciclovir group was lower than that in the acyclovir group, and the difference was statistically significant P<0.05. After treatment, the levels of atypical lymphocyte proportion, lymphocyte proportion, and WBC count in the two groups were lower than those before treatment, the levels in the ganciclovir group were lower than those in the acyclovir group, and the difference was statistically significant P<0.05. After treatment, the EBV-DNA negative conversion rate (81.25%) in the ganciclovir group was higher than that in the acyclovir group (60.93%) and the difference was statistically significant P<0.05. During treatment, the incidence of adverse reactions in the ganciclovir group was significantly lower than that in the acyclovir group and the difference was statistically significant P<0.05. Conclusion. In the treatment of children with EBV-IM, the therapeutic effect of ganciclovir is obviously superior to that of acyclovir. Ganciclovir can quickly eliminate the symptoms of angina, fever, enlarged lymph nodes, and other signs in children, can improve abnormal blood indicators, and has a higher negative conversion rate of EBV and less adverse reactions.] you can assume that [No difference exists between the efficacy of Acyclovir and Ganciclovir in the treatment of children with Epstein-Barr Virus-associated infectious mononucleosis.].

Question: Given [Differences in medication usage of dental patients by age, gender, race/ethnicity and insurance status. BACKGROUND: Limited studies have investigated the medication profile of young adult dental patients despite the high prevalence of prescription opioid abuse in this population. OBJECTIVE: This study investigated the extent and differences in medication usage of dental patients older than 18 years by age, race/ethnicity, gender, insurance status and mechanism of action in an academic dental clinic setting. METHODS: Using an automated approach, medication names in the electronic dental record were retrieved and classified according to the National Drug Code directory. Descriptive statistics, multivariable ANOVA and Post hoc tests were performed to detect differences in the number of medications by patient demographics. RESULTS: Of the 11,220 adult patients, 53 percent reported taking at least one medication with significant differences in medication usage by demographics. Hydroxymethylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase inhibitors (21-36%), and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (19-23%) ranked the top two medication classes among patients 55 years and older. Opioid agonists (7-14%), and Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors (SSRIs) (5-12%) ranked the top two medication classes among patients aged 18-54 years. CONCLUSIONS: The results underscore the importance of dental providers to review medical and medication histories of patients regardless of their age to avoid adverse events and to determine patient's risk for opioid abuse.

Question: Given [Differences in medication usage of dental patients by age, gender, race/ethnicity and insurance status. BACKGROUND: Limited studies have investigated the medication profile of young adult dental patients despite the high prevalence of prescription opioid abuse in this population. OBJECTIVE: This study investigated the extent and differences in medication usage of dental patients older than 18 years by age, race/ethnicity, gender, insurance status and mechanism of action in an academic dental clinic setting. METHODS: Using an automated approach, medication names in the electronic dental record were retrieved and classified according to the National Drug Code directory. Descriptive statistics, multivariable ANOVA and Post hoc tests were performed to detect differences in the number of medications by patient demographics. RESULTS: Of the 11,220 adult patients, 53 percent reported taking at least one medication with significant differences in medication usage by demographics. Hydroxymethylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase inhibitors (21-36%), and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (19-23%) ranked the top two medication classes among patients 55 years and older. Opioid agonists (7-14%), and Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors (SSRIs) (5-12%) ranked the top two medication classes among patients aged 18-54 years. CONCLUSIONS: The results underscore the importance of dental providers to review medical and medication histories of patients regardless of their age to avoid adverse events and to determine patient's risk for opioid abuse.

Question: Given [Gomisin M2 alleviates psoriasis-like skin inflammation by inhibiting inflammatory signaling pathways. Psoriasis, a chronic inflammatory skin disease, is characterized by the excessive proliferation and impaired differentiation of epidermal keratinocytes and is accompanied by the increased infiltration of inflammatory cells. The condition requires long-term treatment and has no definitive cure. Hence, supplements and therapeutic agents have been intensely investigated. Gomisin M2 (GM2), a lignan extracted from Schisandra chinensis (Turcz). Baill. (Schisandraceae; S. chinensis), has demonstrated diverse pharmacological properties, including anticancer, anti-inflammatory and antiallergic effects. Based on these findings, the present study examined the effects of GM2 on an imiquimod (IMQ)-induced psoriasis mouse model and on keratinocytes stimulated by tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-a and interferon-?. IMQ was topically applied to the back skin of mice for 7 consecutive days, and the mice were orally administered CD. These results showed that the oral administration of GM2 suppressed the symptoms of psoriasis, as evidenced by reductions in skin thickness, psoriasis area severity index scores for psoriasis lesions, transepidermal water loss and myeloperoxidase (MPO)-associated cell infiltration. Furthermore, GM2 reduced the pathologically increased levels of immunoglobulin G2a, MPO and TNF-a in the serum and T helper (Th)1 and Th17 cell populations in the spleen. GM2 decreased the gene expression of inflammatory-related cytokines and chemokines and inhibited the expression of signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 and nuclear factor-?B in the activated keratinocytes.

Question: Given [Long term outcome of functional hemispherectomy for refractory epilepsy: Experience from a single center. Background: Hemispherectomy has an established role as a treatment of last resort in patients with unilateral hemispheric lesions suffering from refractory epilepsy. Methods: Seven patients were evaluated at our Epilepsy Unit. We compared the seizure outcome at 6 months, 1, 2, 5 years post-surgery, as well as at end follow-up (mean 7.1 years) using Engel classification. Reduction of antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) was also assessed utilizing equal time frames. Results: The mean age of seizure onset was 5.4 years. Engel I was achieved in 5 patients at 6 months (71.4%). Engel at 1 year was predicted by the Engel at 6 months (p = 0.013) with a similar number of patients being classified as Engel I outcome. Engel at 2 years was also predicted by Engel at 6 months and at 1 year (p = 0.030). At end follow-up only 3 patients (42.9%) remained categorized as Engel I outcome. There was a trend toward a stability in Engel classification. All patients with developmental causes for their epilepsy experienced some deterioration of the surgical outcomes. Conversely, all patients with acquired causes were stable throughout follow-up. Seizure outcome at 6 months was worse in the patients who had post-op complications (p = 0.044).

Question: Given [Differential tissue distribution of discrete typing units after drug combination therapy in experimental Trypanosoma cruzi mixed infection. The aim of the present work was to evaluate the distribution of the different clones of the parasite prevailing after treatment with benznidazole (BZ) and clomipramine (CLO), in mice infected with Trypanosoma cruzi, Casibla isolate which consists of a mixture of two discrete typing units (DTUs). Albino Swiss mice were infected and treated with high and low concentrations of BZ (100 or 6.25 mg/kg), CLO (5 or 1.25 mg/kg), or the combination of both low doses (BZ6.25 + CLO1.25), during the acute phase of experimental infection. Treatment efficacy was evaluated by comparing parasitaemia, survival and tissular parasite presence. For DTUs genotyping, blood, skeletal and cardiac muscle samples were analysed by multiplex quantitative polymerase chain reaction. The combined treatment had similar outcomes to BZ6.25; BZ100 was the most effective treatment, but it failed to reach parasite clearance and produced greater histological alterations. Non-Treated mice and the ones treated with monotherapies showed both DTUs while BZ6.25 + CLO1.25 treated mice showed only TcVI parasites in all the tissues studied. These findings suggest that the treatment may modify the distribution of infecting DTUs in host tissues. Coinfection with T. cruzi clones belonging to different DTUs reveals a complex scenario for the treatment of Chagas disease and search for new therapies.

Question: Given [Baicalin suppresses the progression of Type 2 diabetes-induced liver tumor through regulating METTL3/m6A/HKDC1 axis and downstream p-JAK2/STAT1/clevaged Capase3 pathway. Background: Epidemiological and clinical evidence suggests that diabetes increases the risk of liver cancer. Although the co-occurrence of type 2 diabetes (T2D) and liver cancer is becoming more frequent, the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Even though baicalin, extensively used in traditional Chinese medicine (TCM), can control T2D and inhibit liver cancer separately, minimal research is available regarding its possible effect on T2D-induced liver cancer. Thus, in the present study, we aimed to investigate the role of baicalin in T2D-induced hepatocellular cancer, and for the first time, we particularly emphasized the regulation of baicalin in genes RNA m6A in hepatocellular cancer. Methods: Here, we constructed a cell culture model under a high concentration of glucose and a T2D-induced liver tumor model to evaluate the in vitro and in vivo role of baicalin in T2D-induced liver cancer progression. After confirming the suppressive effect of baicalin and the HKDC1 antibody on T2D-induced liver tumors, the epigenetic alterations (DNA 5mC and RNA m6A) of the baicalin-regulated HKDC1 gene were detected using MS and q-PCR. Next, the METTL3 gene-regulated m6A (2854 site) was investigated using SELECT PCR. Finally, the impact of the other three baicalin analogs (baicalein, wogonoside, and wogonin) on tumor inhibition was tested in vivo while verifying the related RNA m6A mechanism. Results: The results showed that baicalin and the HKDC1 antibody suppressed T2D-induced liver tumor progression in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, baicalin significantly inhibited the epigenetic modification (DNA 5mC and RNA m6A) of HKDC1 in HepG2 tumors, mainly targeting the RNA m6A site (2854). The m6A-related gene, METTL3, regulated the RNA m6A site (2854) of HKDC1, which was also restricted by baicalin. Moreover, the study verified that baicalin regulated the METTL3/HKDC1/JAK2/STAT1/caspase-3 pathway in liver cancer cells when exposed to a high glucose concentration. In addition, the three baicalin analogs were proven to regulate the m6A (2854 site) of HKDC1 and suppress T2D-induced liver tumors.

Question: Given [Disruption of KCC2 in Parvalbumin-Positive Interneurons Is Associated With a Decreased Seizure Threshold and a Progressive Loss of Parvalbumin-Positive Interneurons. GABAA receptors are ligand-gated ion channels, which are predominantly permeable for chloride. The neuronal K-Cl cotransporter KCC2 lowers the intraneuronal chloride concentration and thus plays an important role for GABA signaling. KCC2 loss-of-function is associated with seizures and epilepsy. Here, we show that KCC2 is expressed in the majority of parvalbumin-positive interneurons (PV-INs) of the mouse brain. PV-INs receive excitatory input from principle cells and in turn control principle cell activity by perisomatic inhibition and inhibitory input from other interneurons. Upon Cre-mediated disruption of KCC2 in mice, the polarity of the GABA response of PV-INs changed from hyperpolarization to depolarization for the majority of PV-INs. Reduced excitatory postsynaptic potential-spike (E-S) coupling and increased spontaneous inhibitory postsynaptic current (sIPSC) frequencies further suggest that PV-INs are disinhibited upon disruption of KCC2. In vivo, PV-IN-specific KCC2 knockout mice display a reduced seizure threshold and develop spontaneous sometimes fatal seizures.

Methods: Here, we constructed a cell culture model under a high concentration of glucose and a T2D-induced liver tumor model to evaluate the in vitro and in vivo role of baicalin in T2D-induced liver cancer progression. After confirming the suppressive effect of baicalin and the HKDC1 antibody on T2D-induced liver tumors, the epigenetic alterations (DNA 5mC and RNA m6A) of the baicalin-regulated HKDC1 gene were detected using MS and q-PCR. Next, the METTL3 gene-regulated m6A (2854 site) was investigated using SELECT PCR. Finally, the impact of the other three baicalin analogs (baicalein, wogonoside, and wogonin) on tumor inhibition was tested in vivo while verifying the related RNA m6A mechanism. Results: The results showed that baicalin and the HKDC1 antibody suppressed T2D-induced liver tumor progression in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, baicalin significantly inhibited the epigenetic modification (DNA 5mC and RNA m6A) of HKDC1 in HepG2 tumors, mainly targeting the RNA m6A site (2854). The m6A-related gene, METTL3, regulated the RNA m6A site (2854) of HKDC1, which was also restricted by baicalin. Moreover, the study verified that baicalin regulated the METTL3/HKDC1/JAK2/STAT1/caspase-3 pathway in liver cancer cells when exposed to a high glucose concentration. In addition, the three baicalin analogs were proven to regulate the m6A (2854 site) of HKDC1 and suppress T2D-induced liver tumors. Conclusions: The findings of this study revealed that baicalin suppressed T2D-induced liver tumor progression by regulating the METTL3/m6A/HKDC1 axis, which might support its potential application for preventing and treating T2D-induced liver cancer.] you can imply that [Baicalin, extensively used in traditional Chinese medicine, can suppress type 2 diabetes-induced liver tumor progression by regulating the METTL3/m6A/HKDC1 axis.].

Question: Given [Disruption of KCC2 in Parvalbumin-Positive Interneurons Is Associated With a Decreased Seizure Threshold and a Progressive Loss of Parvalbumin-Positive Interneurons. GABAA receptors are ligand-gated ion channels, which are predominantly permeable for chloride. The neuronal K-Cl cotransporter KCC2 lowers the intraneuronal chloride concentration and thus plays an important role for GABA signaling. KCC2 loss-of-function is associated with seizures and epilepsy. Here, we show that KCC2 is expressed in the majority of parvalbumin-positive interneurons (PV-INs) of the mouse brain. PV-INs receive excitatory input from principle cells and in turn control principle cell activity by perisomatic inhibition and inhibitory input from other interneurons. Upon Cre-mediated disruption of KCC2 in mice, the polarity of the GABA response of PV-INs changed from hyperpolarization to depolarization for the majority of PV-INs. Reduced excitatory postsynaptic potential-spike (E-S) coupling and increased spontaneous inhibitory postsynaptic current (sIPSC) frequencies further suggest that PV-INs are disinhibited upon disruption of KCC2. In vivo, PV-IN-specific KCC2 knockout mice display a reduced seizure threshold and develop spontaneous sometimes fatal seizures. We further found a time dependent loss of PV-INs, which was preceded by an up-regulation of pro-apoptotic genes upon disruption of KCC2.] you can imply that [KCC2 has an inhibitory role in Parvalbumin-Positive Interneurons.].

Question: Given [Can pressurised intraperitoneal aerosol chemotherapy with oxaliplatin (PIPAC-O+) be added to standard treatment for resectable high-risk gastric cancer patients? A study protocol. Objectives: Gastric cancer remains one of the most fatal cancers, despite an intensive treatment regime of chemotherapy-surgery-chemotherapy. Peritoneal metastatic disease is commonly diagnosed post treatment regime and once established, patients are likely to die in 3-9 months. Systemic chemotherapy does not increase survival for these patients due to the poor vascularisation of this area. We are proposing the addition of pressurised intraperitoneal aerosol chemotherapy (PIPAC) to the treatment regime for curative patients as a preventive measure to reduce the risk of peritoneal metastases occurring. Methods: This is a prospective, single centre, non-randomised, open-label pilot trial evaluating the addition of PIPAC to the standard multimodal treatment pathway. Patients will undergo standard neoadjuvant chemotherapy with four cycles of fluorouracil, leucovorin, oxaliplatin and docetaxel (FLOT), then PIPAC, followed by gastrectomy. Four cycles of FLOT will be administered post-surgery. Primary outcome is safety and feasibility, assessed by perioperative morbidity and possible interruptions of the standard multimodal treatment pathway.

Question: Given [Disulfiram-loaded lactoferrin nanoparticles for treating inflammatory diseases. Sepsis is a dysregulated immune response to infection and potentially leads to life-threatening organ dysfunction, which is often seen in serious Covid-19 patients. Disulfiram (DSF), an old drug that has been used to treat alcohol addiction for decades, has recently been identified as a potent inhibitor of the gasdermin D (GSDMD)-induced pore formation that causes pyroptosis and inflammatory cytokine release. Therefore, DSF represents a promising therapeutic for the treatment of inflammatory disorders. Lactoferrin (LF) is a multifunctional glycoprotein with potent antibacterial and anti-inflammatory activities that acts by neutralizing circulating endotoxins and activating cellular responses. In addition, LF has been well exploited as a drug nanocarrier and targeting ligands. In this study, we developed a DSF-LF nanoparticulate system (DSF-LF NP) for combining the immunosuppressive activities of both DSF and LF. DSF-LF NPs could effectively block pyroptosis and inflammatory cytokine release from macrophages. Treatment with DSF-LF NPs showed remarkable therapeutic effects on lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced sepsis. In addition, this therapeutic strategy was also applied to treat ulcerative colitis (UC), and substantial treatment efficacy was achieved in a murine colitis model. The underlying mode of action of these DSF-LF-NPs may contribute to efficiently suppressing macrophage-mediated inflammatory responses and ameliorating the complications caused by sepsis and UC. As macrophage pyroptosis plays a pivotal role in inflammation, this safe and effective biomimetic nanomedicine may offer a versatile therapeutic strategy for treating various inflammatory diseases by repurposing DSF.

Question: Given [Cost-effectiveness of drug-management of hypertension among patients in selected secondary facilities in Nigeria: Empirical evidence for rational prescription choices. Background: The financial burden of managing hypertension in developing countries, where most of healthcare is funded out-of-pocket, is huge and poor patients cannot sustainably afford it. This is a challenge for most people, especially in sub-Sa-haran Africa with poor health indices, and this informed the investigation of the cost-effectiveness of anti-hypertensive drugs. Methodology: This was essentially a before-and-after study without control, in which blood pressure was assessed after commencing treatment with anti-hypertensive drugs among hypertensive patients. A systematic sampling technique was employed to recruit 320 participants from new patients attending cardiology clinic and admitted into the wards in four secondary health facilities offering specialized medical services in Nigeria. Results: The median cost of drug treatment of hypertension per week was N977.50; this cost was much lower for monotherapy than combined therapy. Similarly, the median costs of treatment per decrease in systolic and diastolic blood pressures were higher with combined therapy than monothe-rapy. The median cost of treatment per decrease in systolic blood pressure was higher than diastolic pressure. Diuretics had the most cost per decrease in diastolic blood pressure, while ACEI had the highest costs per decrease in systolic blood pressure and the highest cost per week. The lowest cost per week was recorded for beta-blockers, which also had the lowest cost per decrease in diastolic blood pressure and similar to the average cost per unit decrease in systolic blood pressure for centrally acting drugs.

Chemoinformatics appraisal and molecular docking were employed to investigate 225 complexes of 75 schizophrenia antipsychotics with the dopamine receptor subtypes D2R, D3R, and D4R. Considering the effective noncovalent interactions in the subtype-D2 receptor selectivity of antipsychotics, this study evaluated the possible physicochemical properties of ligands underlying the design of safer and more effective antipsychotics. The pan-Assay interference compounds (PAINs) include about 25% of typical antipsychotics and 5% of atypicals. Popular antipsychotics like haloperidol, clozapine, risperidone, and aripiprazole are not PAINs. They have stronger interactions with D2R and D4R, but their interactions with D3R are slightly weaker, which is similar to the behavior of dopamine. In contrast to typical antipsychotics, atypical antipsychotics exhibit more noncovalent interactions with D4R than with D2R. These results suggest that selectivity to D2R and D4R comes from the synergy between hydrophobic and hydrogen-bonding interactions through their concomitant occurrence in the form of a hydrogen-bonding site adorned with hydrophobic contacts in antipsychotic-receptor complexes.

Previously, we demonstrated that activated-leukocyte-cell-adhesion-molecule (ALCAM) is a prognostic factor in MM and inhibits EGF/EGFR-initiated MM clonogenicity. In this study, we further showed that the ALCAM-EGF/EGFR axis regulated the MM side population (SP)-mediated drug-resistance. ALCAM-knockdown MM cells displayed an enhanced ratio of SP cells in the presence of bone marrow stromal cells (BMSCs) or with the supplement of recombinant EGF. SP MM cells were resistant to chemotherapeutics melphalan or bortezomib. Drug treatment stimulated SP-genesis. Mechanistically, EGFR, primed with EGF, activated the hedgehog pathway and promoted the SP ratio; meanwhile, ALCAM inhibited EGFR downstream pro-MM cell signaling. Further, SP MM cells exhibited an increased number of mitochondria compared to the main population. Interference of the mitochondria function strongly inhibited SP-genesis. Animal studies showed that combination therapy with both an anti-MM agent and EGFR inhibitor gefitinib achieved prolonged MM-bearing mice survival. Hence, our work identifies ALCAM as a novel negative regulator of MM drug-resistance, and EGFR inhibitors may be used to improve MM therapeutic efficacy.] you can imply that [The activated leukocyte-cell adhesion molecule (ALCAM) is a positive regulator of drug resistance in multiple myeloma.].

Question: Given [Does mirabegron deteriorate spermatogenesis? A lesson from spinal cord injury cases. Objectives: To evaluate whether the long-term usage of mirabegron, which was reported to have potential side effects on male reproductive organs in animal studies, was harmful to spermatogenesis in human testis. Methods: Thirty consecutive patients with spinal cord injury (20-48 years old) who performed clean intermittent catheterization were involved in this study. Ten patients were treated with mirabegron (50 mg/d) for more than 2 years and refrained from using an antimuscarinic agent due to the side effects of constipation and dry mouth. Twenty patients were treated with neither anticholinergic agents nor mirabegron. All underwent conventional testicular sperm extraction. The sperm recovery rate and histopathologic findings of the retrieved testicular tissue were compared between both groups. Results: We found no difference in the sperm recovery rate (P =.083) between both groups. Spinal cord injury patients treated with mirabegron had better spermatogenesis than those not treated with mirabegron (P <.05). Conclusions: From these data, we conclude that the therapeutic dose of mirabegron had no harmful effect on spermatogenesis in spinal cord injury patients of reproductive age.] you can imply that [Spermatogenesis in spinal cord injury patients is deteriorated due to long-term use of mirabegron.].

Research has been hindered by both the inability in blinding the exposure, and by the need for recruiting large enough cohorts. The aim of this study is to investigate whether using a new form of air purifier using plasma air purification (PAP) in operating rooms (ORs) lowers the SSI rate or not. Methods and analysis Multicentre, double-blind, cluster-randomised, placebo-controlled trial conducted at seven hospitals in 2017-2022. All patients that undergo orthopaedic surgery for minimum 30 min are included. Intervention group: patients operated in OR with PAP devices turned on. Control group: patients operated in OR with PAP devices turned off. Randomisation: each OR will be randomised in periods of 4 weeks, 6 weeks or 8 weeks to either have the devices on or off. Primary outcome: any SSI postoperatively defined as a composite endpoint of any of the following: use of isoxazolylpenicillin, clindamycin or rifampicin for 2 days or more, International Classification of Diseases codes or Nordic Medico-Statistical Committee codes indicating postoperative infection. In a second step, we will perform a chart review on those patients with positive indicators of SSI to further validate the outcome. Secondary outcomes are described in the Methods section. Power: we assume an SSI rate of 2%, an SSI reduction rate of 25% and we need approximately 45 000 patients to attain a power of 80% at a significance level of 0.05. Ethics and dissemination The study is approved by the Swedish Ethical Review Authority. The interim analysis results from the study will be presented only to the researchers involved unless the study thereafter is interrupted for whatever reason. Publication in a medical journal will be presented after inclusion of the last patient. Trial registration number NCT02695368.

Question: Given [Safety of intravenous tranexamic acid in patients undergoing supratentorial meningiomas resection: Protocol for a randomised, parallel-group, placebo control, non-inferiority trial. Introduction Growing evidence recommends antifibrinolytic agent tranexamic acid (TXA) to reduce blood loss and transfusions rate in various surgical settings. However, postoperative seizure, as one of the major adverse effects of TXA infusion, has been a concern that restricts its utility in neurosurgery. Methods and analysis This is a randomised, placebo-controlled, non-inferiority trial. Patients with supratentorial meningiomas and deemed suitable for surgical resection will be recruited in the trial. Patients will be randomised to receive either a single administration of 20 mg/kg TXA or a placebo of the same volume with a 1:1 allocation ratio after anaesthesia induction. The primary endpoint is the cumulative incidence of early postoperative seizures within 7 days after craniotomy. Secondary outcomes include the incidence of non-seizure complications, changes of haemoglobin level from baseline, intraoperative blood loss, erythrocyte transfusion volume, Karnofsky Performance Status, all-cause mortality, and length of stay, and total hospitalisation cost. Ethics and dissemination This trial is registered at ClinicalTrial.gov and approved by the Chinese Ethics Committee of Registering Clinical Trials (ChiECRCT20200224). The findings will be disseminated in peer-reviewed journals and presented at national or international conferences relevant to subject fields.

Question: Given [EPOS trial: The effect of air filtration through a plasma chamber on the incidence of surgical site infection in orthopaedic surgery: A study protocol of a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. Introduction There is controversy regarding the importance of air-transmitted infections for surgical site infections (SSIs) after orthopaedic surgery. Research has been hindered by both the inability in blinding the exposure, and by the need for recruiting large enough cohorts. The aim of this study is to investigate whether using a new form of air purifier using plasma air purification (PAP) in operating rooms (ORs) lowers the SSI rate or not. Methods and analysis Multicentre, double-blind, cluster-randomised, placebo-controlled trial conducted at seven hospitals in 2017-2022. All patients that undergo orthopaedic surgery for minimum 30 min are included. Intervention group: patients operated in OR with PAP devices turned on.

Question: Given [Anti-CCR4 treatment depletes regulatory T cells and leads to clinical activity in a canine model of advanced prostate cancer. Background Targeting regulatory T cell (Treg) infiltration is an emerging strategy for cancer immunotherapy. However, its efficacy in advanced prostate cancer remains unclear. Here, we showed the therapeutic efficacy of anti-Treg treatment in a canine model of advanced prostate cancer. Methods We used dogs with naturally occurring prostate cancer to study the molecular mechanism underlying Treg infiltration and the effect of anti-Treg treatment. Tumor-infiltrating Tregs was evaluated by immunohistochemistry, and the association with prognosis was examined in dogs with spontaneous prostate cancer. The molecular mechanism of Treg infiltration was explored by RNA sequencing and protein analyses. A non-randomized canine clinical trial was conducted to define the therapeutic potential of anti-Treg treatment for advanced prostate cancer. Human prostate cancer datasets were analyzed to compare gene expression in dogs and humans. Results Tumor-infiltrating Tregs were associated with poor prognosis in dogs bearing spontaneous prostate cancer. RNA sequencing and protein analyses showed a possible link between the CCL17-CCR4 pathway and the increase of tumor-infiltrating Tregs. Dogs with advanced prostate cancer responded to mogamulizumab, a monoclonal antibody targeting CCR4, with decreased circulating Tregs, improved survival, and low incidence of clinically relevant adverse events. Urinary CCL17 concentration and BRAF V595E mutation were independently predictive of the response to mogamulizumab. Analysis of a transcriptomic dataset of human prostate cancer showed that the CCL17-CCR4 axis correlated with Foxp3. In silico survival analyses revealed that high expression of CCL17 was associated with poor prognosis. Immunohistochemistry confirmed that tumor-infiltrating Tregs expressed CCR4 in human patients with prostate cancer. Conclusions Anti-Treg treatment, through CCR4 blockade, may be a promising therapeutic approach for advanced prostate cancer in dogs and some population of human patients.

Question: Given [Early neonatal respiratory distress revealing meningitis caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae serotype 17F: a case report. Background: Streptococcus pneumoniae (S. pneumoniae) is the first leading cause of invasive diseases such as meningitis, bacteremia and pneumoniae in children. In this case we report an early neonatal respiratory distress revealing meningitis caused by S. pneumoniae Serotype 17F through vertical transmission, in the newborn of 3 hours of live. Case description: A male late preterm newborn was born by vaginal delivery at a gestational age of 34 weeks. At 3 hours of life, he was admitted for early moderate neonatal respiratory distress in the Neonatal Medicine and Resuscitation Service. Cerebrospinal fluid culture yielded S. pneumoniae belonging to serotype 17F while the blood culture was negative. The same pneumococcal serotype was recovered from the high vaginal swab of the mother. Both isolates were found susceptible to all tested antibiotics except tetracycline and chloramphenicol to which the strain was resistant. Antibiotherapy management of the child included ceftriaxone at 150mg/kg/day for 21 days, in combination with gentamycin at 5 mg/kg/day for 5 days. ciprofloxacin was added at 40mg/kg/day in two doses for a period of three weeks as the baby presented a hydrocephalus.

Question: Given [A novel technique of endonasopharyngeal ultrasound-guided transnasopharyngeal needle aspiration in the diagnosis of submucosal recurrence of nasopharyngeal carcinoma after chemoradiotherapy. Background: Recurrence of nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) after chemoradiotherapy is common, but submucosal recurrence of NPC is rare. The final pathological results determine the optimal therapeutic schedule for treatment of NPC recurrence, but tissue retrieval from submucosal lesions is usually difficult. The present study aimed to assess the safety and efficacy of a novel approach of endonasopharyngeal ultrasound-guided transnasopharyngeal needle aspiration (ENUS-TNNA) for submucosal neoplasms in patients with suspected NPC recurrence. Methods: Between March 2017 and June 2021, 11 post-chemoradiotherapy patients with suspected magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings of submucosal recurrence of NPC underwent ENUS-TNNA. The safety and effectiveness of using ENUS-TNNA to sample submucosal neoplasms were evaluated. Results: Needle aspiration biopsies were performed without any incidences in all cases. Out of the 11 patients, nine were diagnosed with submucosal recurrence of NPC via histopathological or cytological evaluations. Of the two puncture-negative cases, one patient had atypical imaging findings and clinical manifestations and was therefore followed-up using MRI. After follow-up for 3 years, this patient was still considered to be cancer-free due to the shrinking diameters of the submucosal lesions. For the other puncture-negative patient, submucosal biopsy samples were obtained using a surgical method. Pathological examination of these biopsies revealed that an angiosarcoma had developed after radiotherapy. There were no severe complications that occurred during the ENUS-TNNA procedure. Conclusion: ENUS-TNNA is a safe, effective, and minimally invasive approach to obtain tissue samples from the submucosal region of the nasopharynx for patients with suspected NPC recurrence.] you can assume that [Endonasopharyngeal ultrasound-guided transnasopharyngeal needle aspiration can cause submucosal recurrence of nasopharyngeal carcinoma after chemoradiotherapy.].

Question: Given [Early onset of efficacy with fremanezumab in patients with episodic and chronic migraine: subanalysis of two phase 2b/3 trials in Japanese and Korean patients. Background: Early onset of action has become recognized as an important efficacy feature of preventive migraine treatment, which can help overcome adherence issues commonly associated with older medications. Preventive treatments that target the calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) or the CGRP receptor have been previously shown to provide early onset of action. Methods: This subanalysis of primary endpoints of two separate phase 2b/3 studies sought to determine the onset of action of fremanezumab in Japanese and Korean patients with episodic migraine (EM) and chronic migraine (CM). Results: In EM patients (n = 357), both fremanezumab quarterly and fremanezumab monthly led to greater reductions in weekly migraine days (days/week) than placebo from the first week after the initial injection and thereafter during the remainder of the study period. Similarly, CM patients (n = 571) had a greater reduction in headache days of at least moderate severity (days/week) with fremanezumab (total) than placebo. The percentage of patients with a migraine day (EM) or headache day at least moderate severity (CM) was lower in those treated with fremanezumab than placebo and this effect was apparent from as early as Day 2 (1 day after first injection).

Question: Given [Brain functional MRI responses to blue light stimulation in Leber's hereditary optic neuropathy. Melanopsin retinal ganglion cells (mRGCs) are intrinsically photosensitive photoreceptors contributing both to image and non-image-forming (NIF) functions of the eye. They convey light signal to the brain to modulate circadian entrainment, sleep, alertness, cognition, brightness perception and coarse vision. Given that rods and cones also contribute to all these impacts of light, isolating mRGC visual and NIF roles in humans is challenging so that mRGC functions remains to be fully characterized. Here, we evaluated light-driven visual and cognitive brain responses in Leber's Hereditary Optic Neuropathy (LHON), an inherited optic neuropathy that is characterized by a selective relative sparing of the melanopsin-expressing retinal ganglion cells (mRGCs). Twelve patients and twelve matched healthy controls (HC) were enrolled in a functional brain magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) protocol including visual and visual-cognitive paradigms under blue (480 nm) and red (620 nm) light exposures. Primary visual cortex activation was detected in LHON patients; in particular higher occipital activation was found in response to sustained blue vs. red stimulation in LHON vs. HC. Similarly, brain responses to the executive task were larger under blue vs. red light in LHON over lateral prefrontal cortex. These findings are in line with the relative mRGC sparing demonstrated in LHON and support the mRGC contribution to both non-visual and visual brain functions, with potential implication for visual rehabilitation in hereditary optic neuropathy patients.] you can assume that [In Leber's hereditary optic neuropathy, brain responses to the executive task are larger under red light than under blue light.].

Question: Given [Effect of Amoxicillin and Clavulanate Potassium Combined with Bazhengsan on Pediatric Urinary Tract Infection. Objective. To explore the therapeutic effect of amoxicillin and clavulanate potassium combined with Bazhengsan on pediatric urinary tract infection (UTI). Methods. The data of 120 UTI children treated in Wuhan Xinzhou District People's Hospital from February 2019 to February 2020 were retrospectively analyzed. They were equally split into experimental group (EG) and control group (CG) according to the order of admission. All children were treated with amoxicillin and clavulanate potassium for suspension (twice a day), and EG was additionally treated with one dose of Bazhengsan daily. Both groups were treated for 10 days. After treatment, the immune function indexes, inflammatory factor levels, and clinical efficacy were compared before and after treatment. Results. No remarkable differences in the general data such as blood routine and urine routine results were observed between the two groups before treatment (P>0.05). After treatment, EG achieved obviously better immune function indexes (P<0.001) and lower levels of inflammatory factors (P<0.05) compared with CG. Besides, the treatment effective rate in EG (96.7%) was higher than that in CG (P<0.05). Conclusion. Amoxicillin and clavulanate potassium combined with Bazhengsan can improve the immune function of UTI children and reduce the levels of inflammatory factors, with remarkable effects, which should be popularized in practice.

Twelve patients and twelve matched healthy controls (HC) were enrolled in a functional brain magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) protocol including visual and visual-cognitive paradigms under blue (480 nm) and red (620 nm) light exposures. Primary visual cortex activation was detected in LHON patients; in particular higher occipital activation was found in response to sustained blue vs. red stimulation in LHON vs. HC. Similarly, brain responses to the executive task were larger under blue vs. red light in LHON over lateral prefrontal cortex. These findings are in line with the relative mRGC sparing demonstrated in LHON and support the mRGC contribution to both non-visual and visual brain functions, with potential implication for visual rehabilitation in hereditary optic neuropathy patients.] you can infer that [In Leber's hereditary optic neuropathy, brain responses to the executive task are larger under red light than under blue light.].

Question: Given [Effect of Amoxicillin and Clavulanate Potassium Combined with Bazhengsan on Pediatric Urinary Tract Infection. Objective. To explore the therapeutic effect of amoxicillin and clavulanate potassium combined with Bazhengsan on pediatric urinary tract infection (UTI). Methods. The data of 120 UTI children treated in Wuhan Xinzhou District People's Hospital from February 2019 to February 2020 were retrospectively analyzed. They were equally split into experimental group (EG) and control group (CG) according to the order of admission. All children were treated with amoxicillin and clavulanate potassium for suspension (twice a day), and EG was additionally treated with one dose of Bazhengsan daily. Both groups were treated for 10 days. After treatment, the immune function indexes, inflammatory factor levels, and clinical efficacy were compared before and after treatment. Results. No remarkable differences in the general data such as blood routine and urine routine results were observed between the two groups before treatment (P>0.05). After treatment, EG achieved obviously better immune function indexes (P<0.001) and lower levels of inflammatory factors (P<0.05) compared with CG. Besides, the treatment effective rate in EG (96.7%) was higher than that in CG (P<0.05). Conclusion. Amoxicillin and clavulanate potassium combined with Bazhengsan can improve the immune function of UTI children and reduce the levels of inflammatory factors, with remarkable effects, which should be popularized in practice.

Question: Given [Receptor mechanisms mediating the anti-neuroinflammatory effects of endocannabinoid system modulation in a rat model of migraine. Calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP), substance P and dural mast cells are main contributors in neurogenic inflammation underlying migraine pathophysiology. Modulation of endocannabinoid system attenuates migraine pain, but its mechanisms of action remain unclear. We investigated receptor mechanisms mediating anti-neuroinflammatory effects of endocannabinoid system modulation in in vivo migraine model and ex vivo hemiskull preparations in rats. To induce acute model of migraine, a single dose of nitroglycerin was intraperitoneally administered to male rats. Moreover, isolated ex vivo rat hemiskulls were prepared to study CGRP and substance P release from meningeal trigeminal afferents. We used methanandamide (cannabinoid agonist), rimonabant (cannabinoid receptor-1 CB1 antagonist), SR144528 (CB2 antagonist) and capsazepine (transient receptor potential vanilloid-1 TRPV1 antagonist) to explore effects of endocannabinoid system modulation on the neurogenic inflammation, and possible involvement of CB1, CB2 and TRPV1 receptors during endocannabinoid effects. Methanandamide attenuated nitroglycerin-induced CGRP increments in in vivo plasma, trigeminal ganglia and brainstem and also in ex vivo hemiskull preparations. Methanandamide also alleviated enhanced number and degranulation of dural mast cells induced by nitroglycerin. Rimonabant, but not capsazepine or SR144528, reversed the attenuating effects of methanandamide on CGRP release in both in vivo and ex vivo experiments. Additionally, SR144528, but not rimonabant or capsazepine, reversed the attenuating effects of methanandamide on dural mast cells. However, neither nitroglycerin nor methanandamide changed substance P levels in both in vivo and ex vivo experiments. Methanandamide modulates CGRP release in migraine-related structures via CB1 receptors and inhibits the degranulation of dural mast cells through CB2 receptors. Selective ligands targeting CB1 and CB2 receptors may provide novel and effective treatment strategies against migraine.] you can assume that [The CB2 antagonist SR144528 can be used as an effective migraine treatment.].

Question: Given [Effect of perinatal vitamin d deficiency on lung mesenchymal stem cell differentiation and injury repair potential. Stem cells, including the resident lung mesenchymal stem cells (LMSCs), are critically important for injury repair. Compelling evidence links perinatal vitamin D (VD) deficiency to reactive airway disease; however, the effects of perinatal VD deficiency on LMSC function is unknown. We tested the hypothesis that perinatal VD deficiency alters LMSC proliferation, differentiation, and function, leading to an enhanced myogenic phenotype. We also determined whether LMSCs' effects on alveolar type II (ATII) cell function are paracrine. Using an established rat model of perinatal VD deficiency, we studied the effects of four dietary regimens (0, 250, 500, or 1,000 IU/kg cholecalciferol-supplemented groups). At Postnatal Day 21, LMSCs were isolated, and cell proliferation and differentiation (under basal and adipogenic induction conditions) were determined. LMSC paracrine effects on ATII cell proliferation and differentiation were determined by culturing ATII cells in LMSC-conditioned media from different experimental groups. Using flow cytometry, .95% of cells were CD45-ve, .90% were CD901ve, .58% were CD1051ve, and .64% were Stro-11ve, indicating their stem cell phenotype. Compared with the VD-supplemented groups, LMSCs from the VD-deficient group demonstrated suppressed PPARc, but enhanced Wnt signaling, under basal and adipogenic induction conditions. LMSCs from 250 VD- and 500 VD-supplemented groups effectively blocked the effects of perinatal VD deficiency. LMSC-conditioned media from the VD-deficient group inhibited ATII cell proliferation and differentiation compared with those from the 250 VD- and 500 VD-supplemented groups.

Question: Given [Botanical Drug Puerarin Ameliorates Liposaccharide-Induced Depressive Behaviors in Mice via Inhibiting RagA/mTOR/p70S6K Pathways. Background. The depressive symptom hallmarks the progression of the neurodegenerative diseases, especially Alzheimer's disease. Bacterial infection is related to inflammation and depression. The present project thereby examined whether botanical drug puerarin could attenuate liposaccharide- (LPS-) induced depressive behaviors in mice. Methods. Adult male C57BL/6N mice were sequentially treated with LPS and puerarin and evaluated for the depressive behaviors by tail suspension test and forced swim test. The brain tissues were profiled for the molecular targets of puerarin by next-generation RNA sequencing technique. Candidate targets were further verified in LPS-treated mice, neural stem cells, and highly differentiated PC12 cell line. Results. Puerarin ameliorated LPS-induced depression in the mice. RNA sequencing profiles revealed that puerarin altered the expression of 16 genes while markedly downregulated Ras-related GTP-binding protein A (RagA) in LPS-treated mice. The effect of puerarin on RagA expression was confirmed by immunostaining, Western blot, and quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR). Biochemical studies showed that puerarin inhibited RagA/mTOR/p70S6K pathway, attenuated the accumulation of mTORC1 in close proximity to lysosome, and reduced the production of proinflammatory cytokines. Conclusions. Botanical drug puerarin attenuated inflammation and depressive behaviors in LPS-challenged mice by inhibiting RagA/mTOR/p70S6K pathways.

Background: Oral cladribine has been approved for the treatment of relapsing multiple sclerosis (MS) yet real-world evidence regarding its effectiveness and safety remains scarce. Objective: To evaluate efficacy and safety outcomes of MS patients following induction of cladribine. Methods: We evaluated our prospective cohort of cladribine-treated MS patients from two tertiary centres in Germany. Relapses, disability worsening and occurrence of new or enlarging T2-hyperintense magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) lesions were assessed as well as lymphocyte counts and herpes virus infections. Results: Among 270 patients treated with cladribine, we observed a profound reduction of both relapses and new or enlarging MRI lesions. Treatment appeared more efficacious, especially in patients without previous therapy or following platform substances. Patients switching from natalizumab were prone to re-emerging disease activity. Among patients following dimethyl fumarate pre-treatment, severe lymphopenia was common and associated with increased rates of herpes virus manifestations. Conclusion: Overall, we observed an efficacy and safety profile of cladribine consistent with data from the phase 3 clinical trial. However, patients switching from natalizumab experienced suboptimal disease control beyond rebound activity following cessation of natalizumab. Furthermore, dimethyl fumarate pre-treatment was associated with a profound risk of developing severe lymphopenia and subsequent herpes virus infections.] you can imply that [Oral cladribine is efficient and safe option for the treatment of relapsing multiple sclerosis in patients switching from natalizumab.].

Question: Given [Association of Preeclampsia and Perinatal Complications with Offspring Neurodevelopmental and Psychiatric Disorders. Importance: Maternal preeclampsia has been reported to increase the risk of autism spectrum disorder, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), and intellectual disability in offspring. However, the association between maternal preeclampsia combined with perinatal complications and neurodevelopmental and psychiatric disorders in offspring is less well documented. Objective: To examine the association of maternal preeclampsia, separately and together with perinatal complications, with neurodevelopmental and psychiatric disorders in offspring. Design, Setting, and Participants: This population-based cohort study used data from nationwide registries in Finland to assess all singleton live births (N = 1 012 723) between January 1, 1996, and December 31, 2014. Offspring were followed up until December 31, 2018 (when the oldest reached age 22 years). Exclusion criteria were maternal inpatient psychiatric diagnoses and pregestational diabetes. The study and data analysis were conducted from May 1, 2020, to June 1, 2021. Exposures: Preeclampsia and perinatal complications (delivery earlier than 34 weeks' gestation and/or small for gestational age). Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary outcomes were neurodevelopmental and psychiatric diagnoses and dispensation of psychotropic drugs among offspring until December 31, 2018. Cox proportional hazards regression analyses were performed to assess the associations. Results: Of 1 012 723 singleton live births (51.1% boys; mean [SD] maternal age at birth, 30.0 [5.4] years; specific data on race and ethnicity were not available in the data set), 21 010 children (2.1%) were exposed to preeclampsia alone, 33 625 children (3.3%) were exposed to perinatal complications alone, and 4891 children (0.5%) were exposed to both preeclampsia and perinatal complications. A total of 93 281 children (9.2%) were diagnosed with a neurodevelopmental or psychiatric disorder. Offspring exposed to both preeclampsia and perinatal complications had an increased risk of any neurodevelopmental or psychiatric disorder after adjusting for potential confounding (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR], 2.11; 95% CI, 1.96-2.26) compared with those not exposed to either preeclampsia or perinatal complications; this risk was higher than exposure to either preeclampsia alone (aHR, 1.18; 95% CI, 1.12-1.23) or perinatal complications alone (aHR, 1.77; 95% CI, 1.72-1.82). Sibling pair analyses did not detect any increase in the risk of neurodevelopmental or psychiatric disorders after exposure to preeclampsia alone, but offspring exposed to both preeclampsia and perinatal complications had increased risks of intellectual disabilities (aHR, 3.24; 95% CI, 1.05-10.06), specific developmental disorders (aHR, 3.56; 95% CI, 2.35-5.41), ADHD and conduct disorders (aHR, 2.42; 95% CI, 1.09-5.39), and other behavioral and emotional disorders (aHR, 2.45; 95% CI, 1.17-5.13). The risk estimates for specific developmental disorders (aHR, 2.82; 95% CI, 2.60-3.05) and ADHD and conduct disorders (aHR, 1.88; 95% CI, 1.65-2.14) were higher among offspring exposed to both preeclampsia and perinatal complications compared with those exposed to perinatal complications alone (aHR, 2.26 [95% CI, 2.18-2.33] and 1.60 [95% CI, 1.52-1.68], respectively). Conclusions and Relevance: In this study, exposure to both maternal preeclampsia and perinatal complications was associated with intellectual disabilities, specific developmental disorders, ADHD and conduct disorders, and other behavioral and emotional disorders in offspring. For specific developmental disorders and ADHD and conduct disorders, the risk estimates were higher among offspring exposed to both preeclampsia and perinatal complications compared with those exposed to perinatal complications only.] you can assume that [Exposure to both maternal preeclampsia and perinatal complications is not associated with intellectual disabilities, specific developmental disorders, ADHD, conduct disorders, or other behavioral and emotional disorders in offspring.].

Question: Given [Effectiveness and safety of direct oral anticoagulants versus warfarin in patients with valvular atrial fibrillation. Background: Direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) are increasingly used in place of warfarin, but evidence about their effectiveness and safety in patients with valvular atrial fibrillation (AF) remains limited. Objective: To assess the effectiveness and safety of DOACs compared with warfarin in patients with valvular AF. Design: New-user retrospective propensity score-matched cohort study. Setting: U.S.-based commercial health care database from 1 January 2010 to 30 June 2019. Participants: Adults with valvular AF who were newly prescribed DOACs or warfarin. Measurements: The primary effectiveness outcome was a composite of ischemic stroke or systemic embolism. The primary safety outcome was a composite of intracranial or gastrointestinal bleeding. Results: Among a total of 56 336 patients with valvular AF matched on propensity score, use of DOACs (vs. warfarin) was associated with lower risk for ischemic stroke or systemic embolism (hazard ratio [HR], 0.64 [95% CI, 0.59 to 0.70]) and major bleeding events (HR, 0.67 [CI, 0.63 to 0.72]). The results for the effectiveness and safety outcomes remained consistent for apixaban (HRs, 0.54 [CI, 0.47 to 0.61] and 0.52 [CI, 0.47 to 0.57], respectively) and rivaroxaban (HRs, 0.74 [CI, 0.64 to 0.86] and 0.87 [CI, 0.79 to 0.96], respectively); with dabigatran, results were consistent for the major bleeding outcome (HR, 0.81 [CI, 0.68 to 0.97]) but not for effectiveness (HR, 1.03 [CI, 0.81 to 1.31]). Limitation: Relatively short follow-up; inability to ascertain disease severity. Conclusion: In this comparative effectiveness study using practice-based claims data, patients with valvular AF who were new users of DOACs had lower risks for ischemic stroke or systemic embolism and major bleeding than new users of warfarin. These data may be used to guide risk- benefit discussions regarding anticoagulant choices for patients with valvular AF.] you can assume that [patients with valvular atrial fibrillation taking direct oral anticoagulants have lower risks for systemic embolism and major bleeding compared to warfarin.].

Question: Given [Blinatumomab-related pneumatosis intestinalis in a pediatric patient with relapsed acute lymphoblastic leukemia: A case report. Introduction: Pneumatosis intestinalis is characterized by air in the subserosal or submucosal layer of the intestine, with the severity ranging from mild and asymptomatic to symptomatic with serious conditions such as intestinal ischemia and perforation requiring surgery. Although several etiologies, including those from conventional chemotherapy agents and molecular target agents, have been suggested, blinatumomab-related pneumatosis intestinalis is quite rare. Case report: An 11-year-old girl with history of B-cell ALL presented with bone marrow relapse 3 years after completion of initial chemotherapy. Reinduction chemotherapy and blinatumomab as post-reinduction consolidation were initiated. On day 28 of blinatumomab therapy, pneumatosis intestinalis from the ascending colon to the hepatic flexure was found incidentally on abdominal computed tomography. Management and outcome: After withholding blinatumomab therapy for 1 month, pneumatosis intestinalis improved significantly without abnormal gastrointestinal symptoms. Blinatumomab was resumed and safely completed. The computed tomography performed 4 months later showed complete resolution of pneumatosis intestinalis.

Question: Given [Effectiveness of polymyxin B hemoperfusion in acute exacerbation of interstitial pneumonia: A retrospective analysis. Background; Acute exacerbation (AE) of interstitial pneumonia (IP) occurs commonly and has a poor prognosis. Polymyxin B hemoperfusion (PMX-DHP) has a beneficial effect on AE of some types of IPs, particularly idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). However, little is known about the efficacy of PMX-DHP in the Korean population. The aim of this study was to examine the effectiveness of PMX-DHP in AE of IP. Methods: We conducted a retrospective study of 12 patients with AE of IP, including two patients with AE of IPF, who were treated with PMX-DHP at our center. Treatment with PMX-DHP was carried out once or twice. We collected and analyzed data on changes in oxygenation with PMX-DHP and survival after AE. Results: In patients with AE of IP, the ratio of partial pressure of arterial oxygen to the fraction of inspired oxygen, or the P/F ratio, had significantly improved at the end of the treatment with PMX-DHP (87.0 [80.3 - 130.9] to 200.6 [105.0 - 245.5] mmHg, p = 0.019). The white blood cell (WBC) count had significantly reduced at the end of the treatment (12,400 [8,860 - 20,287] to 6,800 [3,950 - 15,775]/mm3, p = 0.050). The 28-day and in-hospital mortality rates of patients after AE of IP were 41.7 % and 75.0 %, respectively.

Background: With the emergency use authorization of multiple vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 infection, data are urgently needed to determine their effectiveness in a real-world setting. Objective: To evaluate the short-term effectiveness of vaccines in preventing SARS-CoV-2 infection. Design: Test-negative case-control study using conditional logistic regression. Setting: U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs health care system. Participants: All veterans who had testing for SARS-CoV-2 infection between 15 December 2020 and 4 March 2021 and no confirmed infection before 15 December 2020. Intervention: SARS-CoV-2 vaccination with either the BNT-162b2 (Pfizer-BioNTech) or mRNA-1273 (Moderna) vaccine as part of routine clinical care. Measurements: Effectiveness of vaccination against confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection. Results: Among 54 360 persons who tested positive and 54 360 propensity score-matched control participants, the median age was 61 years, 83.6% were male, and 62% were White. Median body mass index was 31 kg/m2 among those who tested positive and 30 kg/m2 among those who tested negative. Among those who tested positive, 9800 (18.0%) had been vaccinated; among those who tested negative, 17 825 (32.8%) had been vaccinated. Overall vaccine effectiveness 7 or more days after the second dose was 97.1% (95% CI, 96.6% to 97.5%). Effectiveness was 96.2% (CI, 95.5% to 96.9%) for the Pfizer-BioNTech BNT-162b2 vaccine and 98.2% (CI, 97.5% to 98.6%) for the Moderna mRNA-1273 vaccine. Effectiveness remained above 95% regardless of age group, sex, race, or presence of comorbidities. Limitations: Predominantly male population; lack of data on disease severity, mortality, and effectiveness by SARSCoV- 2 variants of concern; and short-term follow-up.

Question: Given [Efficacy and Safety of COVID-19 Convalescent Plasma in Hospitalized Patients: A Randomized Clinical Trial. Importance: There is clinical equipoise for COVID-19 convalescent plasma (CCP) use in patients hospitalized with COVID-19. Objective: To determine the safety and efficacy of CCP compared with placebo in hospitalized patients with COVID-19 receiving noninvasive supplemental oxygen. Design, Setting, and Participants: CONTAIN COVID-19, a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of CCP in hospitalized adults with COVID-19, was conducted at 21 US hospitals from April 17, 2020, to March 15, 2021. The trial enrolled 941 participants who were hospitalized for 3 or less days or presented 7 or less days after symptom onset and required noninvasive oxygen supplementation. Interventions: A unit of approximately 250 mL of CCP or equivalent volume of placebo (normal saline). Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary outcome was participant scores on the 11-point World Health Organization (WHO) Ordinal Scale for Clinical Improvement on day 14 after randomization; the secondary outcome was WHO scores determined on day 28. Subgroups were analyzed with respect to age, baseline WHO score, concomitant medications, symptom duration, CCP SARS-CoV-2 titer, baseline SARS-CoV-2 serostatus, and enrollment quarter. Outcomes were analyzed using a bayesian proportional cumulative odds model. Efficacy of CCP was defined as a cumulative adjusted odds ratio (cOR) less than 1 and a clinically meaningful effect as cOR less than 0.8. Results: Of 941 participants randomized (473 to placebo and 468 to CCP), 556 were men (59.1%); median age was 63 years (IQR, 52-73); 373 (39.6%) were Hispanic and 132 (14.0%) were non-Hispanic Black. The cOR for the primary outcome adjusted for site, baseline risk, WHO score, age, sex, and symptom duration was 0.94 (95% credible interval [CrI], 0.75-1.18) with posterior probability (P[cOR<1] = 72%); the cOR for the secondary adjusted outcome was 0.92 (95% CrI, 0.74-1.16; P[cOR<1] = 76%). Exploratory subgroup analyses suggested heterogeneity of treatment effect: at day 28, cORs were 0.72 (95% CrI, 0.46-1.13; P[cOR<1] = 93%) for participants enrolled in April-June 2020 and 0.65 (95% CrI, 0.41 to 1.02; P[cOR<1] = 97%) for those not receiving remdesivir and not receiving corticosteroids at randomization. Median CCP SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing titer used in April to June 2020 was 1:175 (IQR, 76-379). Any adverse events (excluding transfusion reactions) were reported for 39 (8.2%) placebo recipients and 44 (9.4%) CCP recipients (P =.57). Transfusion reactions occurred in 2 (0.4) placebo recipients and 8 (1.7) CCP recipients (P =.06).

Question: Given [Efficacy and Safety of COVID-19 Convalescent Plasma in Hospitalized Patients: A Randomized Clinical Trial. Importance: There is clinical equipoise for COVID-19 convalescent plasma (CCP) use in patients hospitalized with COVID-19. Objective: To determine the safety and efficacy of CCP compared with placebo in hospitalized patients with COVID-19 receiving noninvasive supplemental oxygen. Design, Setting, and Participants: CONTAIN COVID-19, a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of CCP in hospitalized adults with COVID-19, was conducted at 21 US hospitals from April 17, 2020, to March 15, 2021. The trial enrolled 941 participants who were hospitalized for 3 or less days or presented 7 or less days after symptom onset and required noninvasive oxygen supplementation. Interventions: A unit of approximately 250 mL of CCP or equivalent volume of placebo (normal saline). Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary outcome was participant scores on the 11-point World Health Organization (WHO) Ordinal Scale for Clinical Improvement on day 14 after randomization; the secondary outcome was WHO scores determined on day 28. Subgroups were analyzed with respect to age, baseline WHO score, concomitant medications, symptom duration, CCP SARS-CoV-2 titer, baseline SARS-CoV-2 serostatus, and enrollment quarter. Outcomes were analyzed using a bayesian proportional cumulative odds model. Efficacy of CCP was defined as a cumulative adjusted odds ratio (cOR) less than 1 and a clinically meaningful effect as cOR less than 0.8. Results: Of 941 participants randomized (473 to placebo and 468 to CCP), 556 were men (59.1%); median age was 63 years (IQR, 52-73); 373 (39.6%) were Hispanic and 132 (14.0%) were non-Hispanic Black. The cOR for the primary outcome adjusted for site, baseline risk, WHO score, age, sex, and symptom duration was 0.94 (95% credible interval [CrI], 0.75-1.18) with posterior probability (P[cOR<1] = 72%); the cOR for the secondary adjusted outcome was 0.92 (95% CrI, 0.74-1.16; P[cOR<1] = 76%). Exploratory subgroup analyses suggested heterogeneity of treatment effect: at day 28, cORs were 0.72 (95% CrI, 0.46-1.13; P[cOR<1] = 93%) for participants enrolled in April-June 2020 and 0.65 (95% CrI, 0.41 to 1.02; P[cOR<1] = 97%) for those not receiving remdesivir and not receiving corticosteroids at randomization. Median CCP SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing titer used in April to June 2020 was 1:175 (IQR, 76-379). Any adverse events (excluding transfusion reactions) were reported for 39 (8.2%) placebo recipients and 44 (9.4%) CCP recipients (P =.57). Transfusion reactions occurred in 2 (0.4) placebo recipients and 8 (1.7) CCP recipients (P =.06).

Question: Given [A methyltransferase-defective vesicular stomatitis virus-based SARS-CoV-2 vaccine candidate provides complete protection against SARS-CoV-2 infection in hamsters. The current pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has led to dramatic economic and health burdens. Although the worldwide SARS-CoV-2 vaccination campaign has begun, exploration of other vaccine candidates is needed due to uncertainties with the current approved vaccines, such as durability of protection, cross-protection against variant strains, and costs of long-term production and storage. In this study, we developed a methyltransferase-defective recombinant vesicular stomatitis virus (mtdVSV)based SARS-CoV-2 vaccine candidate. We generated mtdVSVs expressing SARS-CoV-2 full-length spike (S) protein, S1, or its receptor-binding domain (RBD). All of these recombinant viruses grew to high titers in mammalian cells despite high attenuation in cell culture. The SARS-CoV-2 S protein and its truncations were highly expressed by the mtdVSV vector. These mtdVSV-based vaccine candidates were completely attenuated in both immunocompetent and immunocompromised mice. Among these constructs, mtdVSV-S induced high levels of SARS-CoV-2-specific neutralizing antibodies (NAbs) and Th1-biased T-cell immune responses in mice. In Syrian golden hamsters, the serum levels of SARS-CoV-2-specific NAbs triggered by mtdVSV-S were higher than the levels of NAbs in convalescent plasma from recovered COVID-19 patients. In addition, hamsters immunized with mtdVSV-S were completely protected against SARS-CoV-2 replication in lung and nasal turbinate tissues, cytokine storm, and lung pathology. Collectively, our data demonstrate that mtdVSV expressing SARS-CoV-2 S protein is a safe and highly efficacious vaccine candidate against SARS-CoV-2 infection. IMPORTANCE Viral mRNA cap methyltransferase (MTase) is essential for mRNA stability, protein translation, and innate immune evasion. Thus, viral mRNA cap MTase activity is an excellent target for development of live attenuated or live vectored vaccine candidates. Here, we developed a panel of MTase-defective recombinant vesicular stomatitis virus (mtdVSV)-based SARS-CoV-2 vaccine candidates expressing full-length S, S1, or several versions of the RBD.

Question: Given [Efficacy of repeated intravenous tranexamic acid in reducing perioperative bleeding of acetabular fractures. Application of tranexamic acid (TXA) in the treatment of acetabular fractures could reduce intraoperative and postoperative blood loss. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effect of single and repeated intravenous infusion of TXA on blood loss of acetabular fractures. METHODS: 120 patients with acetabular fractures admitted to our hospital from January 2017 to September 2020 were retrospectively divided into three groups: Patients accepted 1g TXA at preoperative 30 minutes were defined as single TXA group (n=40); Patients accepted 1g TXA at preoperative 30 minutes and 1g TXA at 3 hours after the start of surgery were defined as repeated TXA group (n=40); Patients accepted normal saline at preoperative 30 minutes were defined as control group (n=40). RESULTS: The total blood loss in single TXA group and repeated TXA group were significantly lower than control group, and the total blood loss in the repeated TXA group was significantly lower than single TXA group (P<0.05). The hidden blood loss from surgery to postoperative 1 day in repeated TXA group was significantly lower than single TXA group and the control group(P<0.05). No significant differences were observed in the operative time, postoperative transfusion rate and thrombosis rate among the three groups (P> 0.05). CONCLUSION: Repeated TXA is more recommended during acetabular fracture surgery since it can reduce the total blood loss without increasing the operative time, postoperative transfusion rate and thrombosis rate compared with single TXA.

In addition, camouflaging the NPs with a macrophage membrane can evade the immune system and further improve tumor homing. We designed gemcitabine-loaded PLGA NPs with a macrophage membrane coating (MPGNPs) to reduce drug toxicity and increase the accumulation in the tumor. The combination of MPGNPs and erlotinib synergistically inhibited pancreatic cancer cell proliferationin vitroandin vivoby targeting the PI3K/AKT/mTOR and Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK signaling pathways. The MPGNPs were also able to evade phagocytosis and achieve passive targeting to the pancreatic tumors. The combination of MPGNPs and erlotinib showed synergistic anti-tumor efficacyin vitroandin vivo. This study provides a proof-of-concept for treating pancreatic cancer with a combination of MPGNPs and erlotinib.] you can imply that [Combination of gemcitabine-loaded macrophage-like nanoparticles and erlotinib has synergistic anti-tumor efficacy in vitro and in vivo.].

Question: Given [Efficacy of repeated intravenous tranexamic acid in reducing perioperative bleeding of acetabular fractures. Application of tranexamic acid (TXA) in the treatment of acetabular fractures could reduce intraoperative and postoperative blood loss. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effect of single and repeated intravenous infusion of TXA on blood loss of acetabular fractures. METHODS: 120 patients with acetabular fractures admitted to our hospital from January 2017 to September 2020 were retrospectively divided into three groups: Patients accepted 1g TXA at preoperative 30 minutes were defined as single TXA group (n=40); Patients accepted 1g TXA at preoperative 30 minutes and 1g TXA at 3 hours after the start of surgery were defined as repeated TXA group (n=40); Patients accepted normal saline at preoperative 30 minutes were defined as control group (n=40). RESULTS: The total blood loss in single TXA group and repeated TXA group were significantly lower than control group, and the total blood loss in the repeated TXA group was significantly lower than single TXA group (P<0.05). The hidden blood loss from surgery to postoperative 1 day in repeated TXA group was significantly lower than single TXA group and the control group(P<0.05). No significant differences were observed in the operative time, postoperative transfusion rate and thrombosis rate among the three groups (P> 0.05). CONCLUSION: Repeated TXA is more recommended during acetabular fracture surgery since it can reduce the total blood loss without increasing the operative time, postoperative transfusion rate and thrombosis rate compared with single TXA.

Question: Given [Clinical practices underlie COVID-19 patient respiratory microbiome composition and its interactions with the host. Understanding the pathology of COVID-19 is a global research priority. Early evidence suggests that the respiratory microbiome may be playing a role in disease progression, yet current studies report contradictory results. Here, we examine potential confounders in COVID-19 respiratory microbiome studies by analyzing the upper (n = 58) and lower (n = 35) respiratory tract microbiome in well-phenotyped COVID-19 patients and controls combining microbiome sequencing, viral load determination, and immunoprofiling. We find that time in the intensive care unit and type of oxygen support, as well as associated treatments such as antibiotic usage, explain the most variation within the upper respiratory tract microbiome, while SARS-CoV-2 viral load has a reduced impact. Specifically, mechanical ventilation is linked to altered community structure and significant shifts in oral taxa previously associated with COVID-19. Single-cell transcriptomics of the lower respiratory tract of COVID-19 patients identifies specific oral bacteria in physical association with proinflammatory immune cells, which show higher levels of inflammatory markers. Overall, our findings suggest confounders are driving contradictory results in current COVID-19 microbiome studies and careful attention needs to be paid to ICU stay and type of oxygen support, as bacteria favored in these conditions may contribute to the inflammatory phenotypes observed in severe COVID-19 patients.] you can assume that [Patient respiratory microbiome composition contributes to the inflammatory phenotypes observed in severe COVID-19 patients.].

Question: Given [Brain functional MRI responses to blue light stimulation in Leber's hereditary optic neuropathy. Melanopsin retinal ganglion cells (mRGCs) are intrinsically photosensitive photoreceptors contributing both to image and non-image-forming (NIF) functions of the eye.

Given that rods and cones also contribute to all these impacts of light, isolating mRGC visual and NIF roles in humans is challenging so that mRGC functions remains to be fully characterized. Here, we evaluated light-driven visual and cognitive brain responses in Leber's Hereditary Optic Neuropathy (LHON), an inherited optic neuropathy that is characterized by a selective relative sparing of the melanopsin-expressing retinal ganglion cells (mRGCs). Twelve patients and twelve matched healthy controls (HC) were enrolled in a functional brain magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) protocol including visual and visual-cognitive paradigms under blue (480 nm) and red (620 nm) light exposures.

Question: Given [Nicotinamide and Pyruvate for Neuroenhancement in Open-Angle Glaucoma: A Phase 2 Randomized Clinical Trial. Importance: Open-angle glaucoma may continue to progress despite significant lowering of intraocular pressure (IOP). Preclinical research has suggested that enhancing mitochondrial function and energy production may enhance retinal ganglion cell survival in animal models of glaucoma, but there is scant information on its effectiveness in a clinical setting. Objective: To test the hypothesis that a combination of nicotinamide and pyruvate can improve retinal ganglion cell function in human glaucoma as measured with standard automated perimetry. Design, Setting, and Participants: In this phase 2, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial at a single academic institution, 197 patients were assessed for eligibility. Of these, 42 patients with treated open-angle glaucoma and moderate visual field loss in at least 1 eye were selected for inclusion and randomized. A total of 32 completed the study and were included in the final analysis. The mean (SD) age was 64.6 (9.8) years. Twenty-one participants (66%) were female. Participant race and ethnicity data were collected via self-report to ensure the distribution reflected that observed in clinical practice in the US but are not reported here to protect patient privacy. Recruitment took place in April 2019 and patients were monitored through December 2020. Data were analyzed from January to May 2021. Interventions: Ascending oral doses of nicotinamide (1000 to 3000 mg) and pyruvate (1500 to 3000 mg) vs placebo (2:1 randomization). Main Outcomes and Measures: Number of visual field test locations improving beyond normal variability in the study eye. Secondary end points were the rates of change of visual field global indices (mean deviation [MD], pattern standard deviation [PSD], and visual field index [VFI]). Results: Twenty-two of 29 participants (76%) randomized to the intervention group and 12 of 13 participants (92%) randomized to placebo received their allocation, and 32 participants (32 eyes; ratio 21:11) completed the study (21 from the intervention group and 11 from the placebo group).

Question: Given [Erratum: Static magnetic fields dampen focused ultrasound-mediated blood-brain barrier opening (Radiology (2021) DOI: 10.1148/radiol.2021204441). Background: Focused ultrasound combined with microbubbles has been used in clinical studies for blood-brain barrier (BBB) opening in conjunction with MRI. However, the impact of the static magnetic field generated by an MRI scanner on the BBB opening outcome has not been evaluated. Purpose: To determine the relationship of the static magnetic field of an MRI scanner on focused ultrasound combined with microbubble- induced BBB opening. Materials and Methods: Thirty wild-type mice were divided into four groups. Mice from different groups were sonicated with focused ultrasound in different static magnetic fields (approximately 0, 1.5, 3.0, and 4.7 T), with all other experimental parameters kept the same. Focused ultrasound sonication was performed after intravenous injection of microbubbles. Microbubble cavitation activity, the fundamental physical mechanism underlying focused ultrasound BBB opening, was monitored with passive cavitation detection. After sonication, contrast-enhanced T1-weighted MRI was performed to assess BBB opening outcome. Intravenously injected Evans blue was used as a model agent to evaluate trans-BBB delivery efficiency. Results: The microbubble cavitation dose decreased by an average of 2.1 dB at 1.5 T (P = .05), 2.9 dB at 3.0 T (P = .01), and 3.0 dB at 4.7 T (P = .01) compared with that outside the magnetic field (approximately 0 T).

Of these, 42 patients with treated open-angle glaucoma and moderate visual field loss in at least 1 eye were selected for inclusion and randomized. A total of 32 completed the study and were included in the final analysis. The mean (SD) age was 64.6 (9.8) years. Twenty-one participants (66%) were female. Participant race and ethnicity data were collected via self-report to ensure the distribution reflected that observed in clinical practice in the US but are not reported here to protect patient privacy. Recruitment took place in April 2019 and patients were monitored through December 2020. Data were analyzed from January to May 2021. Interventions: Ascending oral doses of nicotinamide (1000 to 3000 mg) and pyruvate (1500 to 3000 mg) vs placebo (2:1 randomization). Main Outcomes and Measures: Number of visual field test locations improving beyond normal variability in the study eye. Secondary end points were the rates of change of visual field global indices (mean deviation [MD], pattern standard deviation [PSD], and visual field index [VFI]). Results: Twenty-two of 29 participants (76%) randomized to the intervention group and 12 of 13 participants (92%) randomized to placebo received their allocation, and 32 participants (32 eyes; ratio 21:11) completed the study (21 from the intervention group and 11 from the placebo group). Median (IQR) follow-up time was 2.2 (2.0-2.4) months. No serious adverse events were reported during the study. The number of improving test locations was significantly higher in the treatment group than in the placebo group (median [IQR], 15 [6-25] vs 7 [6-11]; P =.005). Rates of change of PSD suggested improvement with treatment compared with placebo (median, -0.06 vs 0.02 dB per week; 95% CI, 0.02 to 0.24; P =.02) but not MD (0.04 vs -0.002 dB per week; 95% CI, -0.27 to 0.09; P =.35) or VFI (0.09 vs -0.02% per week; 95% CI, -0.53 to 0.36; P =.71). Conclusions and Relevance: A combination of nicotinamide and pyruvate yielded significant short-term improvement in visual function, supporting prior experimental research suggesting a role for these agents in neuroprotection for individuals with glaucoma and confirming the need for long-term studies to establish their usefulness in slowing progression. Trial Registration: ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT03797469.] you can imply that [A combination of nicotinamide and pyruvate can slow open-angle glaucoma progression.].

Question: Given [Erratum: Static magnetic fields dampen focused ultrasound-mediated blood-brain barrier opening (Radiology (2021) DOI: 10.1148/radiol.2021204441). Background: Focused ultrasound combined with microbubbles has been used in clinical studies for blood-brain barrier (BBB) opening in conjunction with MRI. However, the impact of the static magnetic field generated by an MRI scanner on the BBB opening outcome has not been evaluated. Purpose: To determine the relationship of the static magnetic field of an MRI scanner on focused ultrasound combined with microbubble- induced BBB opening. Materials and Methods: Thirty wild-type mice were divided into four groups. Mice from different groups were sonicated with focused ultrasound in different static magnetic fields (approximately 0, 1.5, 3.0, and 4.7 T), with all other experimental parameters kept the same. Focused ultrasound sonication was performed after intravenous injection of microbubbles. Microbubble cavitation activity, the fundamental physical mechanism underlying focused ultrasound BBB opening, was monitored with passive cavitation detection. After sonication, contrast-enhanced T1-weighted MRI was performed to assess BBB opening outcome. Intravenously injected Evans blue was used as a model agent to evaluate trans-BBB delivery efficiency. Results: The microbubble cavitation dose decreased by an average of 2.1 dB at 1.5 T (P = .05), 2.9 dB at 3.0 T (P = .01), and 3.0 dB at 4.7 T (P = .01) compared with that outside the magnetic field (approximately 0 T). The static magnetic field of an MRI scanner decreased BBB opening volume in mice by 3.2-fold at 1.5 T (P <001), 4.5-fold at 3.0 T (P <.001), and 11.6-fold at 4.7 T (P <.001) compared with mice treated outside the magnetic field. It also decreased Evans blue trans-BBB delivery 1.4-fold at 1.5 T (P = .009), 1.6-fold at 3.0 T (P <.001), and 1.9-fold at 4.7 T (P <.001). Conclusion: Static magnetic fields dampened microbubble cavitation activity and decreased trans-blood-brain barrier (BBB) delivery by focused ultrasound combined with microbubble-induced BBB opening.] you can imply that [ The static magnetic field of an MRI scanner does not affect decreased blood-brain barrier opening in mice.].

For this purpose, we studied the role of PCSK9, a cholesterol-regulating enzyme, in OC cell survival and its downstream signaling. We also investigated the cytotoxic efficacy of a small library of metabolic (n = 11) and mTOR (n = 10) inhibitors using OC cell lines (n = 8) and ex vivo patient-derived cell cultures (PDCs, n = 5) to identify clinically suitable drug vulnerabilities.

In addi-tion, overexpression of PCSK9 induced robust AKT phosphorylation along with increased expression of ERK1/2 and MEK1/2, suggesting a pro-survival role of PCSK9 in OC cells. Moreover, our drug testing revealed marked differences in cytotoxic responses to drugs targeting metabolic pathways of high-grade serous ovarian cancer (HGSOC) and low-grade serous ovarian cancer (LGSOC) PDCs. Our results show that targeting PCSK9 expression could impair OC cell survival, which warrants further investigation to address the dependency of this cancer on lipogenesis and omental metastasis.

Question: Given [A methyltransferase-defective vesicular stomatitis virus-based SARS-CoV-2 vaccine candidate provides complete protection against SARS-CoV-2 infection in hamsters. The current pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has led to dramatic economic and health burdens. Although the worldwide SARS-CoV-2 vaccination campaign has begun, exploration of other vaccine candidates is needed due to uncertainties with the current approved vaccines, such as durability of protection, cross-protection against variant strains, and costs of long-term production and storage. In this study, we developed a methyltransferase-defective recombinant vesicular stomatitis virus (mtdVSV)based SARS-CoV-2 vaccine candidate. We generated mtdVSVs expressing SARS-CoV-2 full-length spike (S) protein, S1, or its receptor-binding domain (RBD). All of these recombinant viruses grew to high titers in mammalian cells despite high attenuation in cell culture. The SARS-CoV-2 S protein and its truncations were highly expressed by the mtdVSV vector. These mtdVSV-based vaccine candidates were completely attenuated in both immunocompetent and immunocompromised mice. Among these constructs, mtdVSV-S induced high levels of SARS-CoV-2-specific neutralizing antibodies (NAbs) and Th1-biased T-cell immune responses in mice. In Syrian golden hamsters, the serum levels of SARS-CoV-2-specific NAbs triggered by mtdVSV-S were higher than the levels of NAbs in convalescent plasma from recovered COVID-19 patients. In addition, hamsters immunized with mtdVSV-S were completely protected against SARS-CoV-2 replication in lung and nasal turbinate tissues, cytokine storm, and lung pathology. Collectively, our data demonstrate that mtdVSV expressing SARS-CoV-2 S protein is a safe and highly efficacious vaccine candidate against SARS-CoV-2 infection. IMPORTANCE Viral mRNA cap methyltransferase (MTase) is essential for mRNA stability, protein translation, and innate immune evasion. Thus, viral mRNA cap MTase activity is an excellent target for development of live attenuated or live vectored vaccine candidates. Here, we developed a panel of MTase-defective recombinant vesicular stomatitis virus (mtdVSV)-based SARS-CoV-2 vaccine candidates expressing full-length S, S1, or several versions of the RBD. These mtdVSV-based vaccine candidates grew to high titers in cell culture and were completely attenuated in both immunocompetent and immunocompromised mice. Among these vaccine candidates, mtdVSV-S induces high levels of SARS-CoV-2-specific neutralizing antibodies (Nabs) and Th1-biased immune responses in mice. Syrian golden hamsters immunized with mtdVSV-S triggered SARS-CoV-2-specific NAbs at higher levels than those in convalescent plasma from recovered COVID-19 patients. Furthermore, hamsters immunized with mtdVSV-S were completely protected against SARS-CoV-2 challenge.

Question: Given [Exosome-mediated miR-7-5p delivery enhances the anticancer effect of Everolimus via blocking MNK/eIF4E axis in non-small cell lung cancer. Everolimus is a kind of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitors. Activated mitogen-activated protein kinase interacting kinases/eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E (MNK/eIF4E) axis plays a crucial role in resistance to Everolimus in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The eIF4E phosphorylation increased by mTOR inhibitors is mainly mediated by MNKs. However, the mechanisms are poorly understood. Recently, extensive reprogramming of miRNA profiles has also been found after long-term mTOR inhibitor exposure. Our previous studies have confirmed that tumor suppressor miR-7-5p is decreased in A549 cells after treatment with Everolimus. Exactly, MNK1 is the target of miR-7-5p. In this study, we investigated the biological functions and potential molecular mechanisms of miR-7-5p in the NSCLC undergoing treatment with Everolimus. We confirmed that Everolimus targeted mTORC1 inducing NSCLC cells to secrete miR-7-5p-loaded exosomes in Rab27A and Rab27B-dependent manners. Loss of intracellular miR-7-5p induced phosphorylation of MNK/eIF4E axis, but a supplement of extra exosomal miR-7-5p could reverse it. Of note, both low expression of miR-7-5p and elevated MNK1 protein were associated with a poor prognosis of NSCLC. Both endogenous miR-7-5p and exo-miR-7-5p enhanced the therapeutic efficacy of Everolimus by inhibiting the proliferation, migration, and metastasis of NSCLC in vitro and in vivo. The combination of miR-7-5p with Everolimus induced apoptosis to exhibit a synergistic anticancer therapeutic efficacy through dual abrogation of MNK/eIF4E and mTOR in NSCLC. In conclusion, Everolimus decreases the intracellular miR-7-5p by releasing of miR-7-5p loaded exosomes from NSCLC cells in Rab27A and Rab27B dependent manners. Either endogenous miR-7-5p or exo-miR-7-5p combined with Everolimus can enhance the anticancer efficacy by targeting MNK/eIF4E axis and mTOR. Besides, both low levels of miR-7-5p and positive expression of MNK1 act as independent poor prognostic biomarkers for NSCLC. Therefore, restoring miR-7-5p carried by exosome may be a promising novel combined therapeutic strategy with Everolimus for NSCLC.] you can assume that [miR-7-5p blocks MNK/eIF4E axis in non-small cell lung cancer cells.].

Thus, viral mRNA cap MTase activity is an excellent target for development of live attenuated or live vectored vaccine candidates. Here, we developed a panel of MTase-defective recombinant vesicular stomatitis virus (mtdVSV)-based SARS-CoV-2 vaccine candidates expressing full-length S, S1, or several versions of the RBD. These mtdVSV-based vaccine candidates grew to high titers in cell culture and were completely attenuated in both immunocompetent and immunocompromised mice. Among these vaccine candidates, mtdVSV-S induces high levels of SARS-CoV-2-specific neutralizing antibodies (Nabs) and Th1-biased immune responses in mice. Syrian golden hamsters immunized with mtdVSV-S triggered SARS-CoV-2-specific NAbs at higher levels than those in convalescent plasma from recovered COVID-19 patients. Furthermore, hamsters immunized with mtdVSV-S were completely protected against SARS-CoV-2 challenge. Thus, mtdVSV is a safe and highly effective vector to deliver SARS-CoV-2 vaccine.] you can infer that [Vesicular stomatitis virus expresses SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein, S1.].

Question: Given [Exosome-mediated miR-7-5p delivery enhances the anticancer effect of Everolimus via blocking MNK/eIF4E axis in non-small cell lung cancer. Everolimus is a kind of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitors. Activated mitogen-activated protein kinase interacting kinases/eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E (MNK/eIF4E) axis plays a crucial role in resistance to Everolimus in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The eIF4E phosphorylation increased by mTOR inhibitors is mainly mediated by MNKs. However, the mechanisms are poorly understood. Recently, extensive reprogramming of miRNA profiles has also been found after long-term mTOR inhibitor exposure. Our previous studies have confirmed that tumor suppressor miR-7-5p is decreased in A549 cells after treatment with Everolimus. Exactly, MNK1 is the target of miR-7-5p. In this study, we investigated the biological functions and potential molecular mechanisms of miR-7-5p in the NSCLC undergoing treatment with Everolimus. We confirmed that Everolimus targeted mTORC1 inducing NSCLC cells to secrete miR-7-5p-loaded exosomes in Rab27A and Rab27B-dependent manners. Loss of intracellular miR-7-5p induced phosphorylation of MNK/eIF4E axis, but a supplement of extra exosomal miR-7-5p could reverse it. Of note, both low expression of miR-7-5p and elevated MNK1 protein were associated with a poor prognosis of NSCLC. Both endogenous miR-7-5p and exo-miR-7-5p enhanced the therapeutic efficacy of Everolimus by inhibiting the proliferation, migration, and metastasis of NSCLC in vitro and in vivo. The combination of miR-7-5p with Everolimus induced apoptosis to exhibit a synergistic anticancer therapeutic efficacy through dual abrogation of MNK/eIF4E and mTOR in NSCLC. In conclusion, Everolimus decreases the intracellular miR-7-5p by releasing of miR-7-5p loaded exosomes from NSCLC cells in Rab27A and Rab27B dependent manners. Either endogenous miR-7-5p or exo-miR-7-5p combined with Everolimus can enhance the anticancer efficacy by targeting MNK/eIF4E axis and mTOR. Besides, both low levels of miR-7-5p and positive expression of MNK1 act as independent poor prognostic biomarkers for NSCLC. Therefore, restoring miR-7-5p carried by exosome may be a promising novel combined therapeutic strategy with Everolimus for NSCLC.] you can infer that [miR-7-5p blocks MNK/eIF4E axis in non-small cell lung cancer cells.].

Question: Given [A methyltransferase-defective vesicular stomatitis virus-based SARS-CoV-2 vaccine candidate provides complete protection against SARS-CoV-2 infection in hamsters. The current pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has led to dramatic economic and health burdens. Although the worldwide SARS-CoV-2 vaccination campaign has begun, exploration of other vaccine candidates is needed due to uncertainties with the current approved vaccines, such as durability of protection, cross-protection against variant strains, and costs of long-term production and storage. In this study, we developed a methyltransferase-defective recombinant vesicular stomatitis virus (mtdVSV)based SARS-CoV-2 vaccine candidate. We generated mtdVSVs expressing SARS-CoV-2 full-length spike (S) protein, S1, or its receptor-binding domain (RBD). All of these recombinant viruses grew to high titers in mammalian cells despite high attenuation in cell culture. The SARS-CoV-2 S protein and its truncations were highly expressed by the mtdVSV vector. These mtdVSV-based vaccine candidates were completely attenuated in both immunocompetent and immunocompromised mice. Among these constructs, mtdVSV-S induced high levels of SARS-CoV-2-specific neutralizing antibodies (NAbs) and Th1-biased T-cell immune responses in mice. In Syrian golden hamsters, the serum levels of SARS-CoV-2-specific NAbs triggered by mtdVSV-S were higher than the levels of NAbs in convalescent plasma from recovered COVID-19 patients. In addition, hamsters immunized with mtdVSV-S were completely protected against SARS-CoV-2 replication in lung and nasal turbinate tissues, cytokine storm, and lung pathology.

Although sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors lower serum uric acid, their long-term effect on uric acid metabolism is not well understood. We analyzed pooled data from studies wherein patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus received luseogliflozin, an SGLT2 inhibitor. Upon stratifying patients by baseline glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) or serum uric acid, lower HbA1c or higher serum uric acid level was associated with a greater reduction in serum uric acid after treatment. At week 12 of treatment, significant increases in urinary glucose/creatinine (Cr) ratio and urinary uric acid clearance/Cr clearance ratio (CUA/CCr ratio) and a significant reduction in serum uric acid were observed. Comparison of the subgroups of patients with a reduction or an increase in serum uric acid showed that the increase subgroup had a higher estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) at baseline, and the eGFR was significantly reduced, associated with a significant reduction in the CUA/CCr ratio. Multiple regression analysis showed that the reduction in serum uric acid in the luseogliflozin group was strongly associated with baseline high serum uric acid, low HbA1c levels, and an increase in eGFR. Luseogliflozin was shown to reduce serum uric acid by enhancing urinary uric acid excretion in association with increased urinary glucose.

Question: Given [Silybin Alleviates Experimental Autoimmune Encephalomyelitis by Suppressing Dendritic Cell Activation and Th17 Cell Differentiation. Silybin, a peculiar flavonoid compound derived from the fruit and seeds of Silybum marianum, exhibits strong anti-inflammatory activities. In the present study, we found that silybin effectively alleviated experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), an animal model of multiple sclerosis (MS), via inhibition of dendritic cell (DC) activation and Th17 cell differentiation. Silybin treatment greatly ameliorated the disease severity and significantly declined inflammation and demyelination of the central nervous system (CNS) of EAE mice. Consistent with the disease development, silybin-treated bone marrow-derived DCs (BM-DCs) exhibited reduced costimulatory molecules (e.g., CD80 and CD86) and MHC II expression. These results demonstrated the distinguished bioactivity of silybin for suppressing DC activation, inhibiting pathogenic Th17 inflammatory cell responses, and, eventually, alleviating EAE severity. Taken together, our results show that silybin has high potential for the development of a novel therapeutic agent for the treatment of autoimmune diseases such as MS.] you can imply that [Silybin suppresses dendritic cell activation and Th17 cell differentiation in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis mice.].

Question: Given [Baicalin suppresses the progression of Type 2 diabetes-induced liver tumor through regulating METTL3/m6A/HKDC1 axis and downstream p-JAK2/STAT1/clevaged Capase3 pathway. Background: Epidemiological and clinical evidence suggests that diabetes increases the risk of liver cancer. Although the co-occurrence of type 2 diabetes (T2D) and liver cancer is becoming more frequent, the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Even though baicalin, extensively used in traditional Chinese medicine (TCM), can control T2D and inhibit liver cancer separately, minimal research is available regarding its possible effect on T2D-induced liver cancer. Thus, in the present study, we aimed to investigate the role of baicalin in T2D-induced hepatocellular cancer, and for the first time, we particularly emphasized the regulation of baicalin in genes RNA m6A in hepatocellular cancer. Methods: Here, we constructed a cell culture model under a high concentration of glucose and a T2D-induced liver tumor model to evaluate the in vitro and in vivo role of baicalin in T2D-induced liver cancer progression. After confirming the suppressive effect of baicalin and the HKDC1 antibody on T2D-induced liver tumors, the epigenetic alterations (DNA 5mC and RNA m6A) of the baicalin-regulated HKDC1 gene were detected using MS and q-PCR. Next, the METTL3 gene-regulated m6A (2854 site) was investigated using SELECT PCR. Finally, the impact of the other three baicalin analogs (baicalein, wogonoside, and wogonin) on tumor inhibition was tested in vivo while verifying the related RNA m6A mechanism. Results: The results showed that baicalin and the HKDC1 antibody suppressed T2D-induced liver tumor progression in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, baicalin significantly inhibited the epigenetic modification (DNA 5mC and RNA m6A) of HKDC1 in HepG2 tumors, mainly targeting the RNA m6A site (2854). The m6A-related gene, METTL3, regulated the RNA m6A site (2854) of HKDC1, which was also restricted by baicalin. Moreover, the study verified that baicalin regulated the METTL3/HKDC1/JAK2/STAT1/caspase-3 pathway in liver cancer cells when exposed to a high glucose concentration. In addition, the three baicalin analogs were proven to regulate the m6A (2854 site) of HKDC1 and suppress T2D-induced liver tumors.

Question: Given [Docking Screens of Noncovalent Interaction Motifs of the Human Subtype-D2 Receptor-75 Schizophrenia Antipsychotic Complexes with Physicochemical Appraisal of Antipsychotics. Chemoinformatics appraisal and molecular docking were employed to investigate 225 complexes of 75 schizophrenia antipsychotics with the dopamine receptor subtypes D2R, D3R, and D4R. Considering the effective noncovalent interactions in the subtype-D2 receptor selectivity of antipsychotics, this study evaluated the possible physicochemical properties of ligands underlying the design of safer and more effective antipsychotics. The pan-Assay interference compounds (PAINs) include about 25% of typical antipsychotics and 5% of atypicals.

In contrast to typical antipsychotics, atypical antipsychotics exhibit more noncovalent interactions with D4R than with D2R. These results suggest that selectivity to D2R and D4R comes from the synergy between hydrophobic and hydrogen-bonding interactions through their concomitant occurrence in the form of a hydrogen-bonding site adorned with hydrophobic contacts in antipsychotic-receptor complexes.

Question: Given [Anesthesia, Sedation, and Unplanned Extubation of Tracheal Intubation in Children with Severe Pneumonia. We randomly divided 200 children with severe pneumonia who met the indications for tracheal intubation into 2 groups in this prospective study. One group that received dexmedetomidine for sedation was recorded as the dexmedetomidine group (n = 100), and the group that received midazolam for sedation was recorded as the midazolam group (n = 100). We compared the anesthesia sedation scores, time to fall asleep, time to wake up from anesthesia, related hemodynamic parameters, and adverse reactions between the two groups of children. The failure mode and effect analysis method (FMEA) was also used to investigate the causes of unplanned extubation (UEX) of tracheal intubation in 32 children with severe pneumonia. Our conclusion is as follows: (1) Compared with midazolam, the comprehensive effect of dexmedetomidine on children with severe pneumonia undergoing tracheal intubation for anesthesia and sedation is better, it can effectively shorten the anesthesia induction time and the recovery time after stopping the drug, and there are few adverse reactions, which is worthy of application and promotion. (2) UEX is an important risk factor in the monitoring and nursing of children with severe pneumonia tracheal intubation, and the nursing method of PDCA cycle management is particularly important for them.

Question: Given [Fluoro-deoxyglucose-positron emission tomography/CT scan in superior vena cava syndrome due to radiation-induced fibrosis. A 43-year-old man with a 20 pack-year history of smoking presented with chest pain and hemoptysis that began one month previously. Chest computed tomography (CT) confirmed a 5-cm mass in the right upper lobe involving the right hilum with occlusion of the right main stem bronchus with ipsilateral mediastinal lymph node enlargement (Fig.1A). The primary tumor extended into the mediastinum,but there was no external compression of the carina. The patient was diagnosed as having stage IIIB non-small cell lung cancer. He received concurrent chemo-radiotherapy with cisplatin and etoposide and 60 Gy of radiation to the primary tumor. The dose distribution was calculated based on the CT image, and three-dimensional irradiation was performed. However, the tumor invaded the superior vena cava (SVC); hence, irradiation of the SVC was unavoidable. Fluoro-deoxyglucose-positron emission tomography (FDG-PET)//CT scan performed three months after treatment completion demonstrated complete response to the chemo-radiotherapy. FDG-PET/CT also showed no uptake at a radiation fibrosis near the SVC. At 48 months of follow-up, the patient presented with progressive facial and neck swelling. FDG-PET/CT scan showed pinpoint narrowing of the SVC. As the radiation fibrotic lesion near the SVC did not enlarge or present FDG uptake (Fig. 1B), SVC syndrome was evaluated not by recurrence of lung cancer but by the fibrotic lesion. Stent placement in the SVC and anticoagulation with warfarin was initiated.SVC syndrome was controlled by replacement and development of collateral circulation. Since pleural disseminated lesions were found in the CT scan at that time, the disseminated lesions were treated with irradiation, subsequent chemotherapy and immune checkpoint inhibitors. Thereafter, we conducted FDG-PET/CT scans six times every six months, but the radiation fibrotic lesion near the SVC did not enlarge or present FDG uptake. Two years after the onset of SVC syndrome, the lesion near the SVC had not enlarged and presented no FDG uptake in the FDG-PET/CT scan (Fig. 1C).The patient died of meningeal carcinomatosis that developed 7 years after the initial chemo-radiotherapy.Autopsy examination was not performed.] you can assume that [Chemoradiotherapy is used to treat meningeal carcinomatosis.].

We randomly divided 200 children with severe pneumonia who met the indications for tracheal intubation into 2 groups in this prospective study. One group that received dexmedetomidine for sedation was recorded as the dexmedetomidine group (n = 100), and the group that received midazolam for sedation was recorded as the midazolam group (n = 100). We compared the anesthesia sedation scores, time to fall asleep, time to wake up from anesthesia, related hemodynamic parameters, and adverse reactions between the two groups of children. The failure mode and effect analysis method (FMEA) was also used to investigate the causes of unplanned extubation (UEX) of tracheal intubation in 32 children with severe pneumonia. Our conclusion is as follows: (1) Compared with midazolam, the comprehensive effect of dexmedetomidine on children with severe pneumonia undergoing tracheal intubation for anesthesia and sedation is better, it can effectively shorten the anesthesia induction time and the recovery time after stopping the drug, and there are few adverse reactions, which is worthy of application and promotion. (2) UEX is an important risk factor in the monitoring and nursing of children with severe pneumonia tracheal intubation, and the nursing method of PDCA cycle management is particularly important for them.

Question: Given [Fluoro-deoxyglucose-positron emission tomography/CT scan in superior vena cava syndrome due to radiation-induced fibrosis. A 43-year-old man with a 20 pack-year history of smoking presented with chest pain and hemoptysis that began one month previously. Chest computed tomography (CT) confirmed a 5-cm mass in the right upper lobe involving the right hilum with occlusion of the right main stem bronchus with ipsilateral mediastinal lymph node enlargement (Fig.1A). The primary tumor extended into the mediastinum,but there was no external compression of the carina. The patient was diagnosed as having stage IIIB non-small cell lung cancer. He received concurrent chemo-radiotherapy with cisplatin and etoposide and 60 Gy of radiation to the primary tumor. The dose distribution was calculated based on the CT image, and three-dimensional irradiation was performed. However, the tumor invaded the superior vena cava (SVC); hence, irradiation of the SVC was unavoidable. Fluoro-deoxyglucose-positron emission tomography (FDG-PET)//CT scan performed three months after treatment completion demonstrated complete response to the chemo-radiotherapy. FDG-PET/CT also showed no uptake at a radiation fibrosis near the SVC. At 48 months of follow-up, the patient presented with progressive facial and neck swelling. FDG-PET/CT scan showed pinpoint narrowing of the SVC. As the radiation fibrotic lesion near the SVC did not enlarge or present FDG uptake (Fig. 1B), SVC syndrome was evaluated not by recurrence of lung cancer but by the fibrotic lesion. Stent placement in the SVC and anticoagulation with warfarin was initiated.SVC syndrome was controlled by replacement and development of collateral circulation. Since pleural disseminated lesions were found in the CT scan at that time, the disseminated lesions were treated with irradiation, subsequent chemotherapy and immune checkpoint inhibitors. Thereafter, we conducted FDG-PET/CT scans six times every six months, but the radiation fibrotic lesion near the SVC did not enlarge or present FDG uptake. Two years after the onset of SVC syndrome, the lesion near the SVC had not enlarged and presented no FDG uptake in the FDG-PET/CT scan (Fig. 1C).The patient died of meningeal carcinomatosis that developed 7 years after the initial chemo-radiotherapy.Autopsy examination was not performed.] you can infer that [Chemoradiotherapy is used to treat meningeal carcinomatosis.].

Question: Given [Costs of care for low-energy extremity gunshot injuries are reduced with standardized treatment. Objectives: (1) To determine the overall treatment costs associated with isolated low-energy gunshot wounds (GSWs) to the extremity and (2) to estimate cost savings associated with a single-dose IV antibiotic strategy administered in the emergency room for patients with simple GSWs. Design: Retrospective review. Setting: Level I trauma center. Patients/Participants: Patients (N = 380) with extremity-only GSW injuries from 2010 to 2015 were retrospectively reviewed. Treatment was recorded including type and duration of antibiotics, admission, and surgical intervention. Main Outcome Measures: Costs were calculated including facility services in the operating room and hospital. Results: There were 460 GSWs in 380 patients with a mean age of 30 years old. There were 309 admissions, 273 operations performed, and 1010 days of antibiotics prescribed. The total inpatient facility cost to treat all patients was $1,701,154. Among 179 patients who could be treated by the single-dose antibiotic care pathway for simple GSWs, 132 patients (73%) received additional treatment with 108 hospital admissions, 26 debridement surgeries, and 322 days of additional oral and/or IV antibiotics. The single-dose antibiotic care pathway would have saved an average of $1436 per patient with simple GSWs in actual facility expenses. Conclusions: The overall cost associated with isolated low-energy GSWs to the extremity is high. Limiting antibiotics to a single IV dose in the emergency room can reduce treatment expenses substantially for patients with simple GSWs.

Question: Given [Folinic Acid, Fluorouracil, and Oxaliplatin Therapy for Recurrent Esophageal Cancer with Syndrome of Inadequate Antidiuretic Hormone Secretion (SIADH) After Preoperative Cisplatin/5-Fluorouracil Therapy. Objective: Rare disease Background: Cisplatin/5-fluorouracil therapy is the standard therapy for unresectable and recurrent esophageal cancer. Cisplatin-based chemotherapy often causes adverse effects, such as nausea, vomiting, and renal dysfunction, which may necessitate dose modification or treatment prolongation. Therefore, novel combination therapies are urgently needed to improve the efficacy and overcome drug toxicity in this setting. Case Report: A 77-year-old man with advanced esophageal cancer received cisplatin/5-fluorouracil therapy as neoadjuvant chemotherapy. On day 8 of administration, the patient had lightheadedness, diaphoresis, and nausea and became unconscious and developed severe hyponatremia. We diagnosed the patient with cisplatin-induced syndrome of inadequate antidiuretic hormone secretion (SIADH). Subsequently, water restriction was started, and treatment with a salt-added diet and 3% hypertonic saline infusion was initiated. The hyponatremia improved and the patient was discharged on day 16 of administration. Therefore, neoadjuvant chemotherapy was discontinued, and surgical treatment was performed. However, the tumor recurred and chemotherapy was required. The patient developed severe hyponatremia while receiving neoadjuvant chemotherapy; hence, folinic acid, fluorouracil, and oxaliplatin therapy (FOLFOX) were administered as an alternative treatment. The patient completed the FOLFOX therapy without developing SIADH. Conclusions: The cisplatin/5-fluorouracil therapy is currently the standard chemotherapy regimen for esophageal cancer.

Question: Given [GDF-11 Protects the Traumatically Injured Spinal Cord by Suppressing Pyroptosis and Necroptosis via TFE3-Mediated Autophagy Augmentation. Spinal cord injury (SCI) refers to a major worldwide cause of accidental death and disability. However, the complexity of the pathophysiological mechanism can result in less-effective clinical treatment. Growth differentiation factor 11 (GDF-11), an antiageing factor, was reported to affect the development of neurogenesis and exert a neuroprotective effect after cerebral ischaemic injury. The present work is aimed at investigating the influence of GDF-11 on functional recovery following SCI, in addition to the potential mechanisms involved. We employed a mouse model of spinal cord contusion injury and assessed functional outcomes via the Basso Mouse Scale and footprint analysis following SCI. Using western blot assays and immunofluorescence, we analysed the levels of pyroptosis, autophagy, necroptosis, and molecules related to the AMPK-TRPML1-calcineurin signalling pathway. The results showed that GDF-11 noticeably optimized function-related recovery, increased autophagy, inhibited pyroptosis, and alleviated necroptosis following SCI. Furthermore, the conducive influences exerted by GDF-11 were reversed with the application of 3-methyladenine (3MA), an autophagy suppressor, indicating that autophagy critically impacted the therapeutically related benefits of GDF-11 on recovery after SCI. In the mechanistic study described herein, GDF-11 stimulated autophagy improvement and subsequently inhibited pyroptosis and necroptosis, which were suggested to be mediated by TFE3; this effect resulted from the activity of TFE3 through the AMPK-TRPML1-calcineurin signalling cascade. Together, GDF-11 protects the injured spinal cord by suppressing pyroptosis and necroptosis via TFE3-mediated autophagy augmentation and is a potential agent for SCI therapy.

Question: Given [Emphysema of the periorbital region and mediastinum in a young child following a dental procedure. A 5-year-old boy presented with periorbital swelling due to craniofacial emphysema after a dental procedure. Computed tomography also revealed emphysema of the mediastinum. Pneumoparotitis and anesthesia mumps were considered in the differential diagnosis; however, Stensen's duct as well as the parotid itself appeared normal. It was determined that the most probable cause was dissection of soft tissues around the tooth using air-driven dental handpieces or air syringes, causing air to spread from the buccal, sublingual, and submandibular spaces to the mediastinal compartment inferiorly and cervicofacial compartment superiorly.] you can imply that [Dental procedures using air-driven dental handpieces or air syringes can cause mediastinal emphysema.].

Question: Given [GDF-11 Protects the Traumatically Injured Spinal Cord by Suppressing Pyroptosis and Necroptosis via TFE3-Mediated Autophagy Augmentation. Spinal cord injury (SCI) refers to a major worldwide cause of accidental death and disability. However, the complexity of the pathophysiological mechanism can result in less-effective clinical treatment. Growth differentiation factor 11 (GDF-11), an antiageing factor, was reported to affect the development of neurogenesis and exert a neuroprotective effect after cerebral ischaemic injury. The present work is aimed at investigating the influence of GDF-11 on functional recovery following SCI, in addition to the potential mechanisms involved. We employed a mouse model of spinal cord contusion injury and assessed functional outcomes via the Basso Mouse Scale and footprint analysis following SCI. Using western blot assays and immunofluorescence, we analysed the levels of pyroptosis, autophagy, necroptosis, and molecules related to the AMPK-TRPML1-calcineurin signalling pathway. The results showed that GDF-11 noticeably optimized function-related recovery, increased autophagy, inhibited pyroptosis, and alleviated necroptosis following SCI. Furthermore, the conducive influences exerted by GDF-11 were reversed with the application of 3-methyladenine (3MA), an autophagy suppressor, indicating that autophagy critically impacted the therapeutically related benefits of GDF-11 on recovery after SCI. In the mechanistic study described herein, GDF-11 stimulated autophagy improvement and subsequently inhibited pyroptosis and necroptosis, which were suggested to be mediated by TFE3; this effect resulted from the activity of TFE3 through the AMPK-TRPML1-calcineurin signalling cascade. Together, GDF-11 protects the injured spinal cord by suppressing pyroptosis and necroptosis via TFE3-mediated autophagy augmentation and is a potential agent for SCI therapy.

Question: Given [Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy in infant newborns of diabetic mother: a heterogeneous condition, the importance of anamnesis, physical examination and follow-up. Background: Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) in neonates is a rare and heterogeneous disorder. HCM accounts for 25 to 40% of all pediatric cardiomyopathy cases and the highest incidence in pediatric population is reported in children < 1 year. Case presentation: we report two clinical cases of neonates, born to mothers respectively with a pre-pregnancy insulin-dependent diabetic mellitus type 2 and a suspected diabetes, with inadequate prenatal glycemic control for the first and underestimated glycemic control for the second case, with a different evolution. In the first case, a slow evidence of improvement of the HCM was observed, persuading us to the diagnosis of a diabetes-related HCM; In the second case the progressive worsening of the HCM during follow-up in association with further investigations, resulted in the diagnosis of Pompe disease. Conclusions: Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy in newborns can be the clinical expression of different underlying disorders. We aim to show the importance both to reassess maternal and family history and critically evaluate the physical examination in order to address the correct differential diagnosis.

Question: Given [Lower background infusion of oxycodone for patient-controlled intravenous analgesia, combined with ropivacaine intercostal nerve block, in patients undergoing thoracoscopic lobectomy for lung cancer: A randomized, double-blind, controlled clinical trial. Purpose: To compare the efficacy of a lower dose background infusion of oxycodone for patient-controlled intravenous analgesia (PCIA) with the conventional dose, following intercostal nerve block, for the management of postoperative pain in patients undergoing thoracoscopic lobectomy for lung cancer. Patients and Methods: This was a prospective, single-center, randomized, parallelgroup, double-blind, controlled clinical trial. In total, 155 patients scheduled for elective radical lobectomy via video-assisted thoracoscopy were recruited from December 2018 to July 2019, of whom 140 were ultimately included in the study population. Patients were randomized to receive either oxycodone 0.25 mg/h (low-dose group, n=70) or oxycodone 0.5 mg/h (control group, n=70) as a background infusion for PCIA, following ropivacaine intercostal nerve block, for postoperative pain management. The primary endpoints were rest and dynamic visual analogue scale (VAS) scores within 72 h of the operation. The secondary endpoints were patient satisfaction scores, consumption of postoperative analgesics, times of patient-controlled analgesia (PCA), and adverse events. Results: All 140 enrolled patients completed the study requirements and were included in the final analysis. The rest and dynamic VAS scores at 4 h, 24 h, 48 h, and 72 h postoperative were comparable between the low-dose group and the control group (P>0.05). However, the low-dose group had statistically significantly higher patient satisfaction scores (P<0.001) and lower postoperative analgesic consumption (P<0.001) as well as lower incidence of nausea and vomiting (P<0.05).

Question: Given [Gene Therapy Overexpressing Neuregulin 1 Type I in Combination With Neuregulin 1 Type III Promotes Functional Improvement in the SOD1G93A ALS Mice. Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a fatal neurodegenerative disease affecting the neuromuscular system for which currently there is no effective therapy. Motoneuron (MN) degeneration involves several complex mechanisms, including surrounding glial cells and skeletal muscle contributions. Neuregulin 1 (NRG1) is a trophic factor present particularly in MNs and neuromuscular junctions.

In this study, we combined administration of both viral vectors overexpressing NRG1-I in skeletal muscles and NRG1-III in spinal cord of the SOD1G93A mice in order to obtain a synergistic effect. The results showed that the combinatorial gene therapy increased preservation of MNs and of innervated neuromuscular junctions and reduced glial reactivity in the spinal cord of the treated SOD1G93A mice. Moreover, NRG1 isoforms overexpression improved motor function of hindlimb muscles and delayed the onset of clinical disease. However, this combinatory gene therapy did not produce a synergic effect compared with single therapies, suggesting an overlap between NRG1-I and NRG1-III activated pathways and their beneficial effects.] you can assume that [Gene Therapy Overexpressing Neuregulin 1 Type I in Combination With Neuregulin 1 Type III synergistically Promotes Functional Improvement in the SOD1G93A Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis Mice.].

Question: Given [Clinical and economic benefits of lenzilumab plus standard of care compared with standard of care alone for the treatment of hospitalized patients with COVID-19 in the United States from the hospital perspective. Aims: Estimate the clinical and economic benefits of lenzilumab plus standard of care (SOC) compared with SOC alone in the treatment of patients hospitalized with COVID-19 pneumonia from the United States (US) hospital perspective. Materials and methods: A per-patient cost calculator was developed to report the clinical and economic benefits associated with adding lenzilumab to SOC in newly hospitalized COVID-19 patients over 28 days. Clinical inputs were based on the LIVE-AIR trial, including failure to achieve survival without ventilation (SWOV), mortality, time to recovery, intensive care unit (ICU) admission, and invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV) use. Base case costs included the anticipated list price of lenzilumab, drug administration, and hospital resource costs based on the level of care required. A scenario analysis examined projected one-year rehospitalization costs. Results: In the base case and all scenarios, lenzilumab plus SOC improved all specified clinical outcomes relative to SOC alone.

Question: Given [Gomisin M2 alleviates psoriasis-like skin inflammation by inhibiting inflammatory signaling pathways. Psoriasis, a chronic inflammatory skin disease, is characterized by the excessive proliferation and impaired differentiation of epidermal keratinocytes and is accompanied by the increased infiltration of inflammatory cells. The condition requires long-term treatment and has no definitive cure. Hence, supplements and therapeutic agents have been intensely investigated. Gomisin M2 (GM2), a lignan extracted from Schisandra chinensis (Turcz). Baill. (Schisandraceae; S. chinensis), has demonstrated diverse pharmacological properties, including anticancer, anti-inflammatory and antiallergic effects. Based on these findings, the present study examined the effects of GM2 on an imiquimod (IMQ)-induced psoriasis mouse model and on keratinocytes stimulated by tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-a and interferon-?. IMQ was topically applied to the back skin of mice for 7 consecutive days, and the mice were orally administered CD. These results showed that the oral administration of GM2 suppressed the symptoms of psoriasis, as evidenced by reductions in skin thickness, psoriasis area severity index scores for psoriasis lesions, transepidermal water loss and myeloperoxidase (MPO)-associated cell infiltration. Furthermore, GM2 reduced the pathologically increased levels of immunoglobulin G2a, MPO and TNF-a in the serum and T helper (Th)1 and Th17 cell populations in the spleen. GM2 decreased the gene expression of inflammatory-related cytokines and chemokines and inhibited the expression of signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 and nuclear factor-?B in the activated keratinocytes. These results suggested that GM2 from S. chinensis is a potential therapeutic candidate to alleviate psoriasis-like skin inflammation.] you can assume that [ GM2 from S. chinensis can be used for psoriasis therapy.].

Question: Given [Gomisin M2 alleviates psoriasis-like skin inflammation by inhibiting inflammatory signaling pathways. Psoriasis, a chronic inflammatory skin disease, is characterized by the excessive proliferation and impaired differentiation of epidermal keratinocytes and is accompanied by the increased infiltration of inflammatory cells. The condition requires long-term treatment and has no definitive cure. Hence, supplements and therapeutic agents have been intensely investigated. Gomisin M2 (GM2), a lignan extracted from Schisandra chinensis (Turcz). Baill. (Schisandraceae; S. chinensis), has demonstrated diverse pharmacological properties, including anticancer, anti-inflammatory and antiallergic effects. Based on these findings, the present study examined the effects of GM2 on an imiquimod (IMQ)-induced psoriasis mouse model and on keratinocytes stimulated by tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-a and interferon-?. IMQ was topically applied to the back skin of mice for 7 consecutive days, and the mice were orally administered CD. These results showed that the oral administration of GM2 suppressed the symptoms of psoriasis, as evidenced by reductions in skin thickness, psoriasis area severity index scores for psoriasis lesions, transepidermal water loss and myeloperoxidase (MPO)-associated cell infiltration. Furthermore, GM2 reduced the pathologically increased levels of immunoglobulin G2a, MPO and TNF-a in the serum and T helper (Th)1 and Th17 cell populations in the spleen. GM2 decreased the gene expression of inflammatory-related cytokines and chemokines and inhibited the expression of signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 and nuclear factor-?B in the activated keratinocytes. These results suggested that GM2 from S. chinensis is a potential therapeutic candidate to alleviate psoriasis-like skin inflammation.] you can infer that [ GM2 from S. chinensis can be used for psoriasis therapy.].

Question: Given [Clinical and economic benefits of lenzilumab plus standard of care compared with standard of care alone for the treatment of hospitalized patients with COVID-19 in the United States from the hospital perspective. Aims: Estimate the clinical and economic benefits of lenzilumab plus standard of care (SOC) compared with SOC alone in the treatment of patients hospitalized with COVID-19 pneumonia from the United States (US) hospital perspective. Materials and methods: A per-patient cost calculator was developed to report the clinical and economic benefits associated with adding lenzilumab to SOC in newly hospitalized COVID-19 patients over 28 days. Clinical inputs were based on the LIVE-AIR trial, including failure to achieve survival without ventilation (SWOV), mortality, time to recovery, intensive care unit (ICU) admission, and invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV) use. Base case costs included the anticipated list price of lenzilumab, drug administration, and hospital resource costs based on the level of care required. A scenario analysis examined projected one-year rehospitalization costs. Results: In the base case and all scenarios, lenzilumab plus SOC improved all specified clinical outcomes relative to SOC alone. Lenzilumab plus SOC resulted in estimated cost savings of $3,190 per patient in a population aged <85 years with C-reactive protein (CRP) levels <150 mg/L and receiving remdesivir (base case). Per-patient cost savings were observed in the following scenarios: (1) aged <85 years with CRP <150 mg/L, with or without remdesivir ($1,858); (2) Black and African American patients with CRP <150 mg/L ($13,154); and (3) Black and African American patients from the full population, regardless of CRP level ($2,763). In the full modified intent-to-treat population, an additional cost of $4,952 per patient was estimated. When adding rehospitalization costs to the index hospitalization, a total per-patient cost savings of $5,154 was estimated.

Question: Given [Percutaneous Coronary Intervention in Patients With a History of Gastrointestinal Bleeding (From the Blue Cross Blue Shield of Michigan Cardiovascular Consortium). Potent antithrombotic agents are routinely prescribed after percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) to reduce ischemic complications. However, in patients who are at an increased bleeding risk, this may pose significant risks. We sought to evaluate the association between a history of gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB) and outcomes after PCI. We linked clinical registry data from PCIs performed at 48 Michigan hospitals between 1/2013 and 3/2018 to Medicare claims. We used 1:5 propensity score matching to adjust for patient characteristics. In-hospital outcomes included bleeding, transfusion, stroke or death. Post-discharge outcomes included 90-day all-cause readmission and long-term mortality. Of 30,206 patients, 1.1% had a history of GIB. Patients with a history of GIB were more likely to be older, female, and have more cardiovascular comorbidities. After matching, those with a history of GIB (n = 312) had increased post-procedural transfusions (15.7% vs 8.4%; p < 0.001), bleeding (11.9% vs 5.2%; p < 0.001), and major bleeding (2.8% vs 0.6%; p = 0.004). Ninety-day readmission rates were similar among those with and without a history of GIB (34.3% vs 31.3%; p = 0.318). There was no significant difference in post-discharge survival (1 year: 78% vs 80%; p = 0.217; 5 years: 54% vs 51%; p = 0.189).

Question: Given [HER3 PET Imaging Identifies Dynamic Changes in HER3 in Response to HER2 Inhibition with Lapatinib. Purpose: Standard therapy for HER2+ breast cancers includes HER2 inhibition. While HER2 inhibitors have significantly improved therapeutic outcomes, many patients remain resistant to therapy. An important intrinsic resistance mechanism to HER2 inhibition in some breast cancers is dynamic upregulation of HER3. Increase in HER3 expression that occurs in response to HER2 inhibition allows for continued growth signaling through HER2/HER3 heterodimers, promoting tumor escape. We hypothesized that a non-invasive method to image changes in HER3 expression would be valuable to identify those breast cancers that dynamically upregulate HER3 in response to HER2 inhibition. We further hypothesized that this imaging method could identify those tumors that would benefit by additional HER3 knockdown. Procedures: In a panel of HER2+ breast cancer cell lines treated with the HER2 inhibitor lapatinib, we evaluate changes in HER3 expression and viability. Mouse HER2+ breast cancer models treated with lapatinib were imaged with a peptide-based HER3-specific PET imaging agent [68Ga]HER3P1 to assess for dynamic changes in tumoral HER3 expression and uptake confirmed by biodistribution. Subsequently, HER2+ cell lines were treated with the HER2 inhibitor lapatinib as well HER3-specific siRNA to assess for changes in viability and correlate with HER3 expression upregulation. For all statistical comparisons, P<0.05 was considered statistically significant. Results: Lapatinib treatment of a panel of HER2+ breast cancer cell lines increased HER3 expression in the lapatinib-resistant cell line MDA-MB 453 but not the lapatinib-resistant cell-line HCC-1569. Evaluation of [68Ga]HER3P1 uptake in mice implanted with the HER2+ breast cancer cell lines MDA-MB453 or HCC-1569 prior to and after treatment with lapatinib demonstrated a significant increase in MDA-MB453 tumors only, consistent with in vitro findings. The additional knockdown of HER3 increased therapeutic efficacy of lapatinib only in MDA-MB453 cells, but not in HCC-1569 cells.

Question: Given [Multicentre point-prevalence survey of antibiotic use and healthcare-associated infections in Ethiopian hospitals. Objective Effective antimicrobial containment strategies such as Antimicrobial Stewardship Programs (ASPs) require comprehensive data on antibiotics use which are scarce in Ethiopia. This study sought to assess antibiotics use and healthcare-associated infections (HCAIs) in Ethiopian public hospitals. Design We conducted a cross-sectional study using the WHO point-prevalence survey protocol for systemic antibiotics use and HCAIs for low/middle-income countries. Setting The study was conducted among 10 public hospitals in 2021. Participants All patients admitted to adult and paediatric inpatient and emergency wards before or at 08:00 on the survey date were enrolled. Outcome measure The primary outcome measures were the prevalence of antibiotic use, HCAIs and the hospitals' readiness to implement ASP. Results Data were collected from 1820 patient records. None of the surveyed hospitals had functional ASP. The common indication for antibiotics was for HCAIs (40.3%). Pneumonia was the most common bacterial infection (28.6%) followed by clinical sepsis (17.8%). Most treatments were empiric (96.7%) and the overall prevalence of antibiotic use was 63.8% with antibiotics prescription per patient ratio of 1.77. Ceftriaxone was the most commonly prescribed antibiotic (30.4%) followed by metronidazole (15.4%). Age, having HIV infection, ward type, type of hospital, catheterisation and intubation history had significant association with antibiotic use. Patients who were treated in paediatric surgical wards were about four times more likely to be on antibiotics compared with patients treated at an adult emergency ward. Patients on urinary catheter (adjusted OR (AOR)=2.74, 95% CI: 2.04 to 3.68) and intubation device (AOR=2.62, 95% CI: 1.02 to 6.76) were more likely to be on antibiotics than their non-intubated/non-catheterised counterparts. Patients treated at secondary-level hospitals had 0.34 times lower odds of being on antibiotics compared with those in tertiary hospitals. Conclusions Antibiotic use across the surveyed hospitals was common and most were empiric which has both practical and policy implications for strengthening ASP and promoting rational antibiotics use.

However, the aim of this case report is to emphasize the diversity of symptoms of MIS-C, beyond the defined criteria. Case Presentation: We present a 10-year-old boy with 8p23.1 microdeletion syndrome and multiple comorbidities who initially came to our attention due to hematuria, persistent fever, rash, and elevated markers of inflammation. Within the next 2 days, his condition worsened despite the broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy. Assuming his past history of SARS-CoV-2 exposure, MIS-C was suspected. A high level of clinical suspicion was further supported by significant clinical features (vomiting, abdominal pain, conjunctivitis, arrhythmia, and mild left ventricular systolic dysfunction with pleural effusion) along with laboratory findings (elevated ESR, CRP, proBNP, D-dimers and fibrinogen, positive IgG SARS-CoV-2 antibodies, and negative microbiological cultures). The patient was given intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) and began to show instantaneous clinical and laboratory improvement. Conclusion: Despite numerous reports of MIS-C cases in children, there are still many uncertainties regarding the clinical presentation and laboratory findings, as well as mechanisms beyond this intriguing disorder. In our case, for the first time hematuria is reported as an early symptom of MIS-C. We strongly believe that reporting various manifestations and outcomes in MIS-C patients will lead to improved diagnosis, treatment, and overall understanding of this novel inflammatory condition.] you can assume that [hematuria is a common early symptom of Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children.].

Question: Given [Multicentre point-prevalence survey of antibiotic use and healthcare-associated infections in Ethiopian hospitals. Objective Effective antimicrobial containment strategies such as Antimicrobial Stewardship Programs (ASPs) require comprehensive data on antibiotics use which are scarce in Ethiopia. This study sought to assess antibiotics use and healthcare-associated infections (HCAIs) in Ethiopian public hospitals. Design We conducted a cross-sectional study using the WHO point-prevalence survey protocol for systemic antibiotics use and HCAIs for low/middle-income countries. Setting The study was conducted among 10 public hospitals in 2021. Participants All patients admitted to adult and paediatric inpatient and emergency wards before or at 08:00 on the survey date were enrolled. Outcome measure The primary outcome measures were the prevalence of antibiotic use, HCAIs and the hospitals' readiness to implement ASP. Results Data were collected from 1820 patient records. None of the surveyed hospitals had functional ASP. The common indication for antibiotics was for HCAIs (40.3%). Pneumonia was the most common bacterial infection (28.6%) followed by clinical sepsis (17.8%). Most treatments were empiric (96.7%) and the overall prevalence of antibiotic use was 63.8% with antibiotics prescription per patient ratio of 1.77. Ceftriaxone was the most commonly prescribed antibiotic (30.4%) followed by metronidazole (15.4%). Age, having HIV infection, ward type, type of hospital, catheterisation and intubation history had significant association with antibiotic use. Patients who were treated in paediatric surgical wards were about four times more likely to be on antibiotics compared with patients treated at an adult emergency ward. Patients on urinary catheter (adjusted OR (AOR)=2.74, 95% CI: 2.04 to 3.68) and intubation device (AOR=2.62, 95% CI: 1.02 to 6.76) were more likely to be on antibiotics than their non-intubated/non-catheterised counterparts. Patients treated at secondary-level hospitals had 0.34 times lower odds of being on antibiotics compared with those in tertiary hospitals. Conclusions Antibiotic use across the surveyed hospitals was common and most were empiric which has both practical and policy implications for strengthening ASP and promoting rational antibiotics use.

Question: Given [A rare presentation of panitumumab-involved interstitial lung disease: Spontaneous pneumomediastinum. Introduction: Developments in targeted molecular therapies have considerably improved patient survival in cancer. Panitumumab is a monoclonal antibody against the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). It is used to treat metastatic colorectal carcinoma. Although panitumumab is well tolerated in most patients, pulmonary toxicity, especially interstitial lung disease (ILD), is a life-threatening condition. The presentation of panitumumab-induced ILD with spontaneous pneumomediastinum and subcutaneous emphysema is rarely reported. Case report: We describe a 61-year-old male with metastatic colorectal carcinoma treated with FOLFIRI (folinic acid, 5-fluorouracil, irinotecan) and panitumumab. He presented to our hospital with a complaint of severe dyspnea. On the evaluation of dyspnea, the patient was diagnosed with ILD. Management and outcome: After exclusion of other common causes of pneumomediastinum and subcutaneous emphysema, panitumumab was attributed as a cause of ILD. Oxygen therapy via high flow nasal cannula and intravenous methylprednisolone regimen was started. After two weeks, the patient became asymptomatic with the radiologic amelioration. Discussion: Panitumumab-induced ILD is associated with a poor prognosis and might occur randomly in one year after the drug administration.

Question: Given [Heparin and arginine based plasmin nanoformulation for ischemic stroke therapy. Ischemic stroke is the most common type of stroke and thrombolytic therapy is the only approved treatment.

Plasmin, a direct fibrinolytic, has a significantly superior hemostatic safety profile; however, if injected intravenously it becomes rapidly inactivated by anti-plasmin. Nanoformulations have been shown to increase drug stability and half-life and hence could be applied to increase the plasmin therapeutic efficacy. Here in this paper, we report a novel heparin and arginine-based plasmin nanoformulation that exhibits increased plasmin stability and efficacy. In vitro studies revealed significant plasmin stability in the presence of anti-plasmin and efficient fibrinolytic activity. In addition, these particles showed no significant toxicity or oxidative stress effects in human brain microvascular endothelial cells, and no significant blood brain barrier permeability. Further, in a mouse photothrombotic stroke model, plasmin nanoparticles exhibited significant efficacy in reducing stroke volume without overt intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) compared to free plasmin treatment.

Question: Given [SARS-CoV-2 vaccination does not induce relapses of patients with inflammatory bowel disease. Background Vaccination against SARS-CoV-2 is a promising strategy to protect immunocompromised IBD patients from a severe course of COVID-19. As these patients were excluded from initial clinical vaccination trials, patients frequently express concerns regarding the safety of these vaccines, especially whether vaccination might trigger IBD flares (hit-and-run-hypothesis). Methods In order to assess the risk of an IBD flare after vaccination against SARS-CoV-2, an anonymous survey was performed at five German IBD centers and one patient organization (Deutsche Morbus Crohn/Colitis ulcerosa Vereinigung (DCCV) e.V.) in August and October 2021. Results The questionnaire was answered by 914 patients, 781 of whom reported a previous vaccination against SARS-CoV-2 (85.4%). Vaccination against SARS-CoV-2 was not associated with an increased risk of IBD flares (p=0.319) or unscheduled visits to the IBD physician (p=0.848). Furthermore, typical symptoms of an IBD flare including abdominal pain, increases in stool frequency, or rectal bleeding were not influenced by the vaccination. Conclusion Vaccination against SARS-CoV-2 is safe in IBD patients. These results may help to reduce fears regarding the vaccination in IBD patients.

Question: Given [High-dose Everolimus May Induce Pro-inflammatory/Fibrotic Tran-scriptomic Changes in Bronchial Epithelial Cells from Cystic Fibrosis Patients. Background: Solid-organ transplantation is an available therapeutic option for Cystic Fi-brosis (CF) patients without lung transplantation. However, the use of immunosuppressive agents may cause severe adverse events. In particular, patients treated with mTOR-inhibitors (mTOR-I) may ag-gravate pulmonary complications. It has been recently described that these drugs may induce Epithelial to Mesenchymal Transition (EMT) of the airway cells. Objective: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effects of mTOR-I on primary bronchial epithelial cells carrying F508del. Materials and Methods: Human bronchial epithelial cells homozygous for F508del were treated with 5 and 100 nM EVE for 24 hours, and their RNA was extracted and hybridized to the Human HT-12 v3 Expression BeadChip (Illumina). The microarray results were validated by Real-Time PCR. The tran-sepithelial resistance was measured by a Millicell-ERS ohmmeter. Results: High dosage EVE induced a significant up-regulation of 48 genes and a down-regulation of 14 genes. After pathway analysis by GSEA, we found that most of them were implicated in the inflammatory and pro-fibrotic pathways. Real-time PCR confirmed that 100 nM EVE was able to up-regulate some identified genes (IL-1alpha, IL-8, Pim-1) as well as pro-fibrotic elements (alpha-SMA, connective tissue growth factor, and metalloproteinase-12). In addition, a high dosage of EVE was al-so able to reduce transepithelial resistance. In contrast, a lower level of EVE did not produce similar effects.

Question: Given [Baicalin suppresses the progression of Type 2 diabetes-induced liver tumor through regulating METTL3/m6A/HKDC1 axis and downstream p-JAK2/STAT1/clevaged Capase3 pathway. Background: Epidemiological and clinical evidence suggests that diabetes increases the risk of liver cancer. Although the co-occurrence of type 2 diabetes (T2D) and liver cancer is becoming more frequent, the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Even though baicalin, extensively used in traditional Chinese medicine (TCM), can control T2D and inhibit liver cancer separately, minimal research is available regarding its possible effect on T2D-induced liver cancer. Thus, in the present study, we aimed to investigate the role of baicalin in T2D-induced hepatocellular cancer, and for the first time, we particularly emphasized the regulation of baicalin in genes RNA m6A in hepatocellular cancer. Methods: Here, we constructed a cell culture model under a high concentration of glucose and a T2D-induced liver tumor model to evaluate the in vitro and in vivo role of baicalin in T2D-induced liver cancer progression. After confirming the suppressive effect of baicalin and the HKDC1 antibody on T2D-induced liver tumors, the epigenetic alterations (DNA 5mC and RNA m6A) of the baicalin-regulated HKDC1 gene were detected using MS and q-PCR. Next, the METTL3 gene-regulated m6A (2854 site) was investigated using SELECT PCR. Finally, the impact of the other three baicalin analogs (baicalein, wogonoside, and wogonin) on tumor inhibition was tested in vivo while verifying the related RNA m6A mechanism. Results: The results showed that baicalin and the HKDC1 antibody suppressed T2D-induced liver tumor progression in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, baicalin significantly inhibited the epigenetic modification (DNA 5mC and RNA m6A) of HKDC1 in HepG2 tumors, mainly targeting the RNA m6A site (2854). The m6A-related gene, METTL3, regulated the RNA m6A site (2854) of HKDC1, which was also restricted by baicalin. Moreover, the study verified that baicalin regulated the METTL3/HKDC1/JAK2/STAT1/caspase-3 pathway in liver cancer cells when exposed to a high glucose concentration. In addition, the three baicalin analogs were proven to regulate the m6A (2854 site) of HKDC1 and suppress T2D-induced liver tumors.

Question: Given [Hinokiflavone Inhibits Growth of Esophageal Squamous Cancer By Inducing Apoptosis via Regulation of the PI3K/AKT/mTOR Signaling Pathway. Background: Globally, esophageal cancer ranks as the seventh most common cancer. Esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) is one of its major histological types. ESCC accounts for the vast majority of cases in China, and the mortality rate is high. Cisplatin, the standard adjuvant chemotherapy drug for ESCC, has a modest response rate due to the development of drug resistance. Hinokiflavone (HF) is a natural biflavonoid compound with anti-melanoma activity. However, its anti-tumor effect on ESCC and the underlying mechanisms remain largely unknown. Methods: The ESCC cell lines KYSE150 and TE14 were used. The cell counting kit-8 assay and flow cytometry analysis, along with colony formation, EdU, wound healing, and Transwell migration assays, were performed to assess cell characteristics (viability, migration, invasion, and apoptosis) following treatment with HF. Gene Ontology (GO), Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG), western blotting, and molecular docking were used to investigate the pathways potentially modulated by HF. In vivo anti-tumor effects of HF were also investigated using a mouse xenograft model. Results: Our findings revealed that HF inhibited ESCC cell proliferation. Hoechst 33342 staining, annexin V-FITC/PI staining, and western blotting confirmed that HF causes caspase-dependent apoptosis. KEGG pathway enrichment analysis and western blotting indicated that the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway played an important role in the process of HF-induced apoptosis. Furthermore, HF effectively impaired the migration and invasion abilities of KYSE150 cells and downregulated the expression of the matrix metalloproteinases (MMP) MMP2 and MMP9. HF inhibited tumor growth and exhibited minimal toxicity in the organs of the KYSE150 xenograft model. Conclusion: This is the first study to demonstrate the inhibition of ESCC growth and progression by HF. The underlying mechanism is through blocking the PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway, thereby inhibiting cell proliferation and inducing apoptosis. HF can be used as a complementary/alternative agent for ESCC therapy.] you can assume that [Hinokiflavone can be used as a drug therapy agent for esophageal squamous cell carcinoma treatment.].

Question: Given [Influence of flexible gelatinous coating layer on electrochemical performance and fatigue failure of lithium battery separator. Recently, the battery security issue receives widespread attention. Investigating the compression performance and failure mode of the battery separator, and then simulating the internal soft short-circuit of the battery due to separator rupture becomes the current focus. In this work, commercial polyethylene separators are coated with a Al2O3 composite organic silicone - acrylic acid gel layer and the electrochemical performance are characterized. The coated battery separator (PEAE-5) exhibits the lowest charge transfer resistance and increases the electrochemical stability window to 5.3 V, since the silicone exhibits oxidation resistance and the acrylic provides flexibility in polar electrolyte solvents. Subsequently, the battery separator is punched in cycles to simulate fatigue failure of the separator under external compression. The results indicate that the separator (PEAE-5) coated with a 5% solid content of organic silicone - acrylic acid emulsion exhibits the best combined physical-mechanical and electrochemical properties, maintaining nearly 80% of the original cycling performance after 50 cycles of compression. The separator coated with the composite organic silicone - acrylic acid gel layer suffers the least from cycle fatigue.

Background: The symptoms of patients with respiratory disease are influenced by local environmental factors. The incidence of allergic rhinitis in grassland areas was significantly higher than that in non-grassland areas. We aimed to compare the profiles of chronic rhinitis patients obtained during the autumn pollen season in Baotou (grassland city) and Beijing (non-grassland city), China. Methods: Questionnaire surveys and allergen testing were conducted on 1170 and 1232 patients with chronic rhinitis visiting the Second Affiliated Hospital of Baotou Medical College and Beijing Tongren Hospital, respectively, during the autumn pollen period. Information regarding medical history, severity of symptoms, and diagnosis and treatment was collected. Results: More patients with moderate to severe chronic rhinitis and asthma (both, P < 0.001) were present in Baotou than in Beijing. Mugwort was the most abundant allergen in both regions, but the number of patients sensitized to outdoor allergens in Baotou was higher than that in Beijing (P < 0.001). Indoor allergens in Beijing represented a considerable proportion of allergens, especially dust mites (33.4%).

Question: Given [Comparative analysis of chronic rhinitis patient profiles during autumn pollen season between grassland and non-grassland cities in North China. Background: The symptoms of patients with respiratory disease are influenced by local environmental factors. The incidence of allergic rhinitis in grassland areas was significantly higher than that in non-grassland areas. We aimed to compare the profiles of chronic rhinitis patients obtained during the autumn pollen season in Baotou (grassland city) and Beijing (non-grassland city), China. Methods: Questionnaire surveys and allergen testing were conducted on 1170 and 1232 patients with chronic rhinitis visiting the Second Affiliated Hospital of Baotou Medical College and Beijing Tongren Hospital, respectively, during the autumn pollen period. Information regarding medical history, severity of symptoms, and diagnosis and treatment was collected. Results: More patients with moderate to severe chronic rhinitis and asthma (both, P < 0.001) were present in Baotou than in Beijing. Mugwort was the most abundant allergen in both regions, but the number of patients sensitized to outdoor allergens in Baotou was higher than that in Beijing (P < 0.001). Indoor allergens in Beijing represented a considerable proportion of allergens, especially dust mites (33.4%). For patients with allergic rhinitis, nasal congestion, nasal itching, and runny nose were more severe in Baotou than in Beijing (P < 0.001). In both Baotou and Beijing, allergy (P < 0.001 vs. P = 0.004) and combined asthma (P = 0.049 vs. P = 0.005) were common factors affecting the severity of the clinical symptoms chronic rhinitis. In Baotou, age (rs = 0.195, P < 0.001) and family allergy history (P = 0.010) were also associated with symptom severity. Although significantly more patients in Baotou received oral antihistamines, nasal corticosteroids, and surgical treatment than in Beijing (P < 0.001), the number of people receiving allergy immunotherapy in Baotou was lower (P = 0.004) and post-treatment symptom control was worse (P < 0.001) that that in Beijing. Conclusions: During the pollen period, there were significant differences in the allergen spectrum between Baotou and Beijing. Allergy and combined asthma were common factors affecting the severity of clinical symptoms. Patients in Baotou presented with more severe clinical symptoms that were not satisfactorily managed due to the impact of pollen exposure, inconsistent access to care, and differing treatment modalities.] you can imply that [The severity of the clinical symptoms for patients with allergic rhinitis, nasal congestion, nasal itching, and runny nose is the same for residents of grassland and non-grassland cities.].

Question: Given [Hydroxytyrosol prevents periodontitis-induced bone loss by regulating mitochondrial function and mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling of bone cells. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) overproduction promotes the alveolar bone loss during the development of periodontitis. Mitochondria are the principal source of ROS. Hydroxytyrosol (HT), a natural phenolic compound present in olive oil, is well known for its antioxidant and mitochondrial-protective prosperities. Nonetheless, the impact of HT on periodontitis and its related mechanisms underlying bone cell behavior remains unknown. Osteoclasts differentiated from RAW264.7 model and oxidative stress (OS) induced pre-osteoblast MC3T3-E1 cell injury model were treated with and without HT. Cell viability, apoptosis, differentiation, mitochondrial function along with mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathway were investigated. Meanwhile, the effect and related mechanisms of HT on bone loss in mice with periodontitis were also detected. HT inhibited osteoclast differentiation and prevented OS induced pre-osteoblast cells injury via regulating mitochondrial function as well as ERK and JNK signaling pathways. Moreover, HT attenuated the alveolar bone loss, increased bone forming activity, inhibited the osteoclasts differentiation and decreased the level of OS in mice with periodontitis. Our findings, for the first time, revealed a novel function of HT in bone remodeling of periodontitis, and highlighted its therapeutical potential for the prevention/treatment of periodontitis.] you can imply that [Hydroxytyrosol can be used for the prevention or treatment of periodontitis.].

Question: Given [Docking Screens of Noncovalent Interaction Motifs of the Human Subtype-D2 Receptor-75 Schizophrenia Antipsychotic Complexes with Physicochemical Appraisal of Antipsychotics. Chemoinformatics appraisal and molecular docking were employed to investigate 225 complexes of 75 schizophrenia antipsychotics with the dopamine receptor subtypes D2R, D3R, and D4R. Considering the effective noncovalent interactions in the subtype-D2 receptor selectivity of antipsychotics, this study evaluated the possible physicochemical properties of ligands underlying the design of safer and more effective antipsychotics. The pan-Assay interference compounds (PAINs) include about 25% of typical antipsychotics and 5% of atypicals. Popular antipsychotics like haloperidol, clozapine, risperidone, and aripiprazole are not PAINs. They have stronger interactions with D2R and D4R, but their interactions with D3R are slightly weaker, which is similar to the behavior of dopamine. In contrast to typical antipsychotics, atypical antipsychotics exhibit more noncovalent interactions with D4R than with D2R. These results suggest that selectivity to D2R and D4R comes from the synergy between hydrophobic and hydrogen-bonding interactions through their concomitant occurrence in the form of a hydrogen-bonding site adorned with hydrophobic contacts in antipsychotic-receptor complexes. All the antipsychotics had more synergic interactions with D2R and D4R in comparison with D3R.

Question: Given [Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy in infant newborns of diabetic mother: a heterogeneous condition, the importance of anamnesis, physical examination and follow-up. Background: Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) in neonates is a rare and heterogeneous disorder. HCM accounts for 25 to 40% of all pediatric cardiomyopathy cases and the highest incidence in pediatric population is reported in children < 1 year. Case presentation: we report two clinical cases of neonates, born to mothers respectively with a pre-pregnancy insulin-dependent diabetic mellitus type 2 and a suspected diabetes, with inadequate prenatal glycemic control for the first and underestimated glycemic control for the second case, with a different evolution. In the first case, a slow evidence of improvement of the HCM was observed, persuading us to the diagnosis of a diabetes-related HCM; In the second case the progressive worsening of the HCM during follow-up in association with further investigations, resulted in the diagnosis of Pompe disease. Conclusions: Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy in newborns can be the clinical expression of different underlying disorders. We aim to show the importance both to reassess maternal and family history and critically evaluate the physical examination in order to address the correct differential diagnosis.

Question: Given [Iduronate-2-sulfatase transport vehicle rescues behavioral and skeletal phenotypes in a mouse model of Hunter syndrome. Mucopolysaccharidosis type II (MPS II) is a lysosomal storage disorder caused by deficiency of the iduronate-2-sulfatase (IDS) enzyme, resulting in cellular accumulation of glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) throughout the body. Treatment of MPS II remains a considerable challenge as current enzyme replacement therapies do not adequately control many aspects of the disease, including skeletal and neurological manifestations. We developed an IDS transport vehicle (ETV:IDS) that is engineered to bind to the transferrin receptor; this design facilitates receptor-mediated transcytosis of IDS across the blood-brain barrier and improves its distribution into the brain while maintaining distribution to peripheral tissues. Here we show that chronic systemic administration of ETV:IDS in a mouse model of MPS II reduced levels of peripheral and central nervous system GAGs, microgliosis, and neurofilament light chain, a biomarker of neuronal injury.

Resistance to chemotherapy, enhanced proliferation, invasion, angiogenesis, and metastasis (RPIAM) represent major obstacles that limit the efficacy of cancer treatment especially in advanced stages of cancer. Overcoming or suppressing RPIAM can dramatically improve the treatment out-come. Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is frequently diagnosed in an advanced stage and often possesses intrinsic resistance to chemotherapy accompanied by the fast development of acquired resistance during the treatment. Oncogenic receptor tyrosine kinases (TKs), specifically epidermal growth factor (EGF) TKs, play an important role in the activation of MAPK/PI3K/Akt/STAT pathways, finally leading to the development of RPIAM. However, the suppression of EGF-TK by different drugs is limited by various defensive mechanisms and mutations. In order to effectively prevent the development of RPIAM in NSCLC, we formulated and tested a multicomponent and multifunctional cancer targeted delivery system containing Nanostructured Lipid Carriers (NLCs) as vehicles, luteinizing hormone release hormone (LHRH) as a cancer targeting moiety, EFG-TK inhibitor gefitinib and/or paclitaxel as anticancer drug(s), siRNA targeted to EGF receptor (EGFR) mRNA as a suppressor of EGF receptors, and an imaging agent (rhodamine) for the visualization of cancer cells. Experimental data obtained show that this complex delivery system possesses significantly enhanced anticancer activity that cannot be achieved by individual components applied separately.] you can imply that [A complex delivery system composed of multifunctional lipid-based nanoparticles for co-delivery of anticancer drugs and siRNA shows enhanced anticancer activity for the treatment of non-small cell lung cancer cells.].

Question: Given [Identification of one novel epitope targeting p54 protein of African swine fever virus using monoclonal antibody and development of a capable ELISA. African swine fever (ASF) is one of the most lethal viral diseases affecting both domestic pigs and wild boars. The acute infection of the ASF disease in domestic pigs leads to a 100% mortality rate with symptoms including high fever, vascular changes, cyanosis of the skin. Until now, there are no commercial vaccines and antiviral drugs available for ASF control. Therefore, the spread of ASF poses great economic losses to the pig industry and the ecosystems in the affected countries. A rapid and capable method was urgently needed to monitor ASFV-specific antibodies for controlling the spread of ASFV. In this study, we obtained one strain of monoclonal antibody (mAb) against the p54 protein of ASFV, and the target epitope of the mAb was determined to be 175YTHKDLENSL184. The experimental results demonstrated that the monoclonal antibody could successfully recognize the exogenously expressed p54 protein and the chimeric virus constructed in our laboratory. The mAb could be used as a detection tool for the development of ASF vaccine strains. In addition, the ELISA established by using the obtained synthetic epitope peptide as the antigen had high sensitivity, good specificity and showed the great potential for ASF epidemic monitoring and control.] you can imply that [monoclonal antibody against the p54 protein of the African swine fever (ASF) virus can be used for ASF disease therapy.].

Question: Given [Real-Time Analysis of Antiproliferative Effects of Mouthwashes Containing Alcohol, Sodium Fluoride, Cetylpyridinium Chloride, and Chlorhexidine in Vitro. Objectives. In this study, the cytotoxic responses of six different over-the-counter mouthwashes on L929 cells were analyzed by two different techniques: the traditional colorimetric tetrazolium-based reduction assay (MTT) and the modern impedance-based real-time cell analysis (RTCA) system to investigate their biocompatibility in vitro. Thus, the investigation of the antiproliferative effects of the specified materials via different techniques is vital to reach this goal. Materials and Methods. First, L929 mouse fibroblasts were exposed to the dilutions of mouthwashes for 2 minutes. After incubation, the tetrazolium reduction method was used to assess the metabolic viability of cells measured by colorimetric MTT assay and morphological inspection of cells was performed via phase-contrast microscopy. Furthermore, the effect of each mouthwash on the proliferation, morphology, and adhesion of L929 cells was monitored continuously by a noninvasive and label-free RTCA system for 140 h. Results. Our data showed that all of the mouthwashes had varying cytotoxic effects on fibroblasts compared to the control group in MTT assay. In addition to that, RTCA technology has provided the growth kinetic profiles that can be used to analyze if the treatment is causing antimitotic or DNA-damaging effect on cells. Thus, analysis via this system can tell us the mechanism of toxicity behind the cell growth inhibition in vitro. Here, we found that only mouthwash 1 moderately maintained the viability of the L929 cells, yet displaying antimitotic effects and the other mouthwashes (mouthwash 2-mouthwash 6) showed toxicity via DNA-damaging effects. Conclusions. Of the six types of mouthwash tested, the most biocompatible result was obtained from a mouthwash containing alcohol (i.e., mouthwash 1).

Question: Given [Identifying high dose neostigmine as a risk factor for post-operative respiratory complications: A case-control study. Background: Neostigmine, an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor, is used to reverse the effects of non-depolarizing neuromuscular blocking agents. Inappropriate dosing of neostigmine can lead to post-operative respiratory complications. Post-operative respiratory complications are associated with major morbidity and mortality. The purpose of this case-control study was to determine neuromuscular blockade-related risk factors associated with post-operative respiratory complications (specifically, reintubation, respiratory insufficiency, hypoxia, and/or aspiration). Methods: We performed an Institutional Review Board-approved case-control study of all patients who underwent a general anesthetic requiring neuromuscular blockade at Tufts Medical Center between March 22, 2013 and June 1, 2019. Cases were patients who experienced post-operative complications. We identified 58 controls and 116 cases from a database of 130,178 patients during the 74-month study period. Results: After adjusting for covariates, the administration of high dose neostigmine (> 60 mg per kg ideal body weight) was associated with increased odds of post-operative respiratory complications (odds ratio = 8.2; 95% CI: 2.5-26.6, P < 0.001). Rocuronium dose and the use of train-of-four peripheral nerve stimulator were not associated with post-operative respiratory complications. Conclusions: High dose neostigmine was identified as an independent risk factor for post-operative respiratory complications.

Question: Given [Cesium treatment depresses glycolysis pathway in HeLa cell. Background/Aims: Cesium (Cs) is an alkali metal element that is of no essential use for humans; it has no known beneficial function that is verified by clinical research. When used as an alternative cancer therapy, it even causes toxicity in high doses. Thus, before using Cs as treatment in clinical settings, it is important to clearly determine its biological effects on cells. However, Cs was found to suppress the proliferation of human cervical cancer cells in a dose-dependent manner, and it was assumed that Cs inhibits the glycolysis pathway. In this study, we clearly determined the step of the glycolysis pathway that is affected by Cs. Methods: The glycolytic enzyme expressions, activities, and metabolite concentrations in HeLa cells were measured by PCR, western blotting, and enzymatic methods, after treating the cells with Cs for 3 days. Results: Cs treatment decreased transcriptional and expression levels of hexokinase, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, pyruvate kinase (PK), and lactate dehydrogenase and the activity of PK. Analysis of glycolysis pathway metabolites revealed that Cs treatment reduces lactate level and increases the level of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (oxidized form, NAD+); however, it did not affect the levels of pyruvate and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (reduced form, NADH). Increase of the [NAD+]/[NADH] ratio and decrease of the [lactate]/[pyruvate] ratio indicate that Cs treatment inhibits the aerobic glycolysis pathway. Conclusion: Cs treatment inhibits PK activity and increases the [NAD+]/[NADH] ratio. Hence, Cs has been determined to inhibit glycolysis, especially the aerobic glycolysis pathway.

Using an extended series of GIST samples, we further validated the downregulation of miR-483-3p in imatinib-treated GIST samples by RT-qPCR. Using both gain-and loss-of-function experiments, we showed that miR-483-3p could regulate mitochondrial respiratory Complex II expression, suggesting its role in OXPHOS regulation.

Question: Given [Comparison of dexmedetomidine and meperidine for the prevention of shivering following coronary artery bypass graft: study protocol of a randomised controlled trial. IntroductionShivering is a common complication in the postoperative period. The incidence of shivering has been reported to range from 5% to 65% under general anaesthesia and as 33% during epidural anaesthesia. Shivering can increase perioperative risk in patients. Both dexmedetomidine and meperidine are effective agents for the prevention of postanaesthetic shivering. However, few studies have compared the anti-shivering effects of different agents following coronary artery bypass graft (CABG). This study aims to compare the effects of dexmedetomidine and meperidine on the incidence of shivering in patients undergoing CABG.Methods and analysisA total of 180 patients aged 18-75 years, with an American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) grade of II-IV, undergoing elective CABG will be enrolled and randomly assigned to the dexmedetomidine, meperidine and control groups (placebo) in an intended 1:1:1 allocation ratio. The patients will be followed up for 7 days after surgery. The primary outcome is the incidence of shivering within 24 hours postoperatively. The secondary outcomes are the number of remedial drugs used after surgery, the incidence of postoperative hypotension and bradycardia, sedation scores, endotracheal extubation time, intensive care unit length of stay, incidence of postoperative delirium within 7 days after surgery, incidence of postoperative arrhythmias, incidence of postoperative nausea and vomiting, average hospital length of stay and mortality rate 30 days after surgery.Ethics and disseminationThe study protocol was approved by the ethics committee of The First Affiliated Hospital of Shandong First Medical University on 20 January 2021 (YXLL-KY-2021(002)) and registered at ClinicalTrials.gov. The results of this study will be presented at national and international scientific meetings and conferences. We plan to publish the data in peer-reviewed international scientific journals.Trial registration numberNCT04735965.] you can imply that [The effects of dexmedetomidine and meperidine for the prevention of shivering following a coronary artery bypass graft are similar.].

Question: Given [Imatinib regulates mir-483-3p and mitochondrial respiratory complexes in gastrointestinal stromal tumors. Metabolic adaptation to increased oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) has been found in gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST) upon imatinib treatment.

Discovering molecules that mediate imatinib-induced OXPHOS may lead to the development of therapeutic strategies synergizing the efficacy of imatinib.

Question: Given [Immunogenicity of the Oral Rabies Vaccine Strain SPBN GASGAS in Dogs Under Field Settings in Namibia. Dog-mediated rabies is endemic throughout Africa.

About 78% of the dogs vaccinated by the oral route seroconverted (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, ELISA), though the seroconversion as determined by a rapid fluorescence focus inhibition test (RFFIT) was much lower. None of the factors examined had a significant effect on the seroconversion rate.

Question: Given [High-dose Everolimus May Induce Pro-inflammatory/Fibrotic Tran-scriptomic Changes in Bronchial Epithelial Cells from Cystic Fibrosis Patients. Background: Solid-organ transplantation is an available therapeutic option for Cystic Fi-brosis (CF) patients without lung transplantation. However, the use of immunosuppressive agents may cause severe adverse events. In particular, patients treated with mTOR-inhibitors (mTOR-I) may ag-gravate pulmonary complications. It has been recently described that these drugs may induce Epithelial to Mesenchymal Transition (EMT) of the airway cells. Objective: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effects of mTOR-I on primary bronchial epithelial cells carrying F508del. Materials and Methods: Human bronchial epithelial cells homozygous for F508del were treated with 5 and 100 nM EVE for 24 hours, and their RNA was extracted and hybridized to the Human HT-12 v3 Expression BeadChip (Illumina). The microarray results were validated by Real-Time PCR. The tran-sepithelial resistance was measured by a Millicell-ERS ohmmeter. Results: High dosage EVE induced a significant up-regulation of 48 genes and a down-regulation of 14 genes. After pathway analysis by GSEA, we found that most of them were implicated in the inflammatory and pro-fibrotic pathways. Real-time PCR confirmed that 100 nM EVE was able to up-regulate some identified genes (IL-1alpha, IL-8, Pim-1) as well as pro-fibrotic elements (alpha-SMA, connective tissue growth factor, and metalloproteinase-12). In addition, a high dosage of EVE was al-so able to reduce transepithelial resistance. In contrast, a lower level of EVE did not produce similar effects. Conclusions: Although performed in vitro, our study suggested that in solid organ transplant recipients with CF without a lung transplant, mTOR-I should be used at a low dosage to reduce its contribution to pulmonary inflammation and fibrosis.] you can assume that [In solid organ transplant recipients with cystic fibrosis without a lung transplant, mTOR-I reduces pulmonary inflammation and fibrosis.].

Question: Given [Immunohistochemical Expression of AQP2 and HSP70 in Broiler Kidney Tissue Treated with Salix tetrasperma Roxb. Extract under Heat Exposure. The administration of plant extracts to broilers may be a way to mitigate the effects of heat stress. The importance of AQP2 and HSP70 compounds in maintaining the homeostasis of the chicken body when it is subjected to heat stress is well established. This study aims to determine the effect of giving the ethanolic extract of the leaves of Salix tetrasperma Roxb. on the immunohistochemical expression of AQP2 and HSP70 in exposed and unexposed broiler kidney tissue. This study used 36 samples of 28-day-old chicken kidneys. Chickens were kept in individual cages, provided with feed and drinking water ad libitum. The design used was a completely randomized design with 6 treatments and 6 replications: (a) chickens were reared in conditions exposed to heat (HS + 0); (b) chickens were reared in conditions exposed to heat and given Salix extract at a dose of 50 mg/L drinking water (HS + 50); (c) chickens were reared under heat-exposed conditions and given Salix extract at a dose of 100 mg/L drinking water (HS + 100); (d) chickens were reared in conditions without exposure to heat (n-HS + 0); (e) chickens were reared in conditions without exposure to heat and given Salix extract at a dose of 50 mg/L drinking water (nHS + 50); and (f) chickens were reared in conditions exposed without exposure to heat and given 100 mg/L drinking water (nHS + 100) of Salix extract. Salix extract was given for 24 hours and was renewed every 6 hours. The results showed that giving Salix extract 100 mg/L in drinking water to chickens exposed to heat (HS + 100) reduced the value of the H/L ratio. Giving Salix extract 50-100 mg/L in drinking water caused an upregulated AQP2 expression; on the other hand, it downregulated HSP-70 expression, in chicken kidney tubules both exposed to heat stress and nonexposed to heat stress. In conclusion, exposure to heat stress in broiler chickens and giving Salix extract can increase the formation of aquaporin 2 compounds and suppress the formation of HSP70.

Question: Given [Potential for Increasing Uptake of Radiolabeled 68Ga-DOTATOC and 123I-MIBG in Patients with Midgut Neuroendocrine Tumors Using a Histone Deacetylase Inhibitor Vorinostat. Background: Histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors have been shown in preclinical studies to upregulate norepinephrine transporters in neuroblastoma and pheochromocytoma, and somatostatin receptors in pulmonary carcinoid, small cell lung cancer, and pancreatic neuroendocrine malignancies. This pilot imaging study in humans focuses on midgut neuroendocrine carcinoma metastatic to the liver, evaluating the effect of pretreatment with the HDAC inhibitor vorinostat on uptake of 123I-MIBG and 68Ga-DOTATOC. Materials and Methods: Multiple midgut neuroendocrine liver metastases in clinically stable subjects were imaged with 123I-MIBG and 68Ga-DOTATOC before and after a 4-d course of vorinostat. Scans were performed with strict attention to detail and timed about 1 month apart occurring just before monthly long-acting octreotide administrations. Uptake changes in tumor and normal liver parenchyma were assessed on positron emission computed tomography (PET/CT) with standardized uptake values and on single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) with qualitative ratio images. Results: The experimental units were metastatic liver lesions within patients (n = 50). There was no significant difference in administered activity or uptake time between pairs of scans for either radiotracer. Statistically significant increase in maximum standardized uptake values (SUVmax) averaged over all lesions was noted on the 68Ga-DOTATOC PET scans (+11%, p < 0.01). SUVmax in normal liver showed no significant change (p = 0.12). There was no qualitative change in uptake of 123I-MIBG after vorinostat. Conclusions: In this pilot imaging study in patients with midgut neuroendocrine liver metastases, a short course of the HDAC inhibitor vorinostat induced a statistically significant increase in SUVmax on 68Ga-DOTATOC PET/computed tomography (CT) imaging in some hepatic neuroendocrine tumor metastases. There was no significant effect of vorinostat on tumor uptake of 123I-MIBG on SPECT/CT imaging. Given the pilot nature of this trial, the findings merit further investigation with a more rigorous protocol evaluating longer pretreatment and different dosages of vorinostat or other HDAC inhibitors, as well as effects on the therapeutic capability of 177Lu- or 90Y-somatostatin analogs.

BACKGROUND: Limited studies have investigated the medication profile of young adult dental patients despite the high prevalence of prescription opioid abuse in this population. OBJECTIVE: This study investigated the extent and differences in medication usage of dental patients older than 18 years by age, race/ethnicity, gender, insurance status and mechanism of action in an academic dental clinic setting. METHODS: Using an automated approach, medication names in the electronic dental record were retrieved and classified according to the National Drug Code directory. Descriptive statistics, multivariable ANOVA and Post hoc tests were performed to detect differences in the number of medications by patient demographics. RESULTS: Of the 11,220 adult patients, 53 percent reported taking at least one medication with significant differences in medication usage by demographics. Hydroxymethylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase inhibitors (21-36%), and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (19-23%) ranked the top two medication classes among patients 55 years and older. Opioid agonists (7-14%), and Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors (SSRIs) (5-12%) ranked the top two medication classes among patients aged 18-54 years.

In this study, we evaluated the effect of COVID-19 on TB service indicators in Addis Ababa, where more than two-thirds of the country's COVID-19 morbidity was recorded. Design We performed a comparative retrospective study to evaluate the impact of COVID-19 on TB services during the pre-COVID-19 era (from April 2019 to March 2020) and the COVID-19 era (from April 2020 to March 2021) in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. We extracted data on total TB detection rate, TB treatment success rate, isoniazid prophylaxis therapy, and drug susceptibility tests and others from the health information system. Using Poisson regression, we estimated the incidence rate ratios and the absolute number difference of the indicators (number per quarter and year) in the COVID-19 and pre-COVID-19 eras. Results Compared with the pre-COVID-19 era, the total TB detection, bacteriologically confirmed TB, TB treatment success rate, latent TB infection treatment and community health workers' engagement in TB detection decreased, respectively, by 11%, 11.8%, 17%, 44.7% and 77.2% during the COVID-19 period.

Question: Given [Differences in medication usage of dental patients by age, gender, race/ethnicity and insurance status. BACKGROUND: Limited studies have investigated the medication profile of young adult dental patients despite the high prevalence of prescription opioid abuse in this population. OBJECTIVE: This study investigated the extent and differences in medication usage of dental patients older than 18 years by age, race/ethnicity, gender, insurance status and mechanism of action in an academic dental clinic setting. METHODS: Using an automated approach, medication names in the electronic dental record were retrieved and classified according to the National Drug Code directory. Descriptive statistics, multivariable ANOVA and Post hoc tests were performed to detect differences in the number of medications by patient demographics. RESULTS: Of the 11,220 adult patients, 53 percent reported taking at least one medication with significant differences in medication usage by demographics. Hydroxymethylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase inhibitors (21-36%), and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (19-23%) ranked the top two medication classes among patients 55 years and older. Opioid agonists (7-14%), and Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors (SSRIs) (5-12%) ranked the top two medication classes among patients aged 18-54 years. CONCLUSIONS: The results underscore the importance of dental providers to review medical and medication histories of patients regardless of their age to avoid adverse events and to determine patient's risk for opioid abuse.

Question: Given [Impact of COVID-19 pandemic on TB prevention and care in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia: A retrospective database study. Objective The current COVID-19 pandemic in Ethiopia could cause severe dysfunction in tuberculosis (TB) treatment, diagnostic services, and prevention and control efforts. In this study, we evaluated the effect of COVID-19 on TB service indicators in Addis Ababa, where more than two-thirds of the country's COVID-19 morbidity was recorded. Design We performed a comparative retrospective study to evaluate the impact of COVID-19 on TB services during the pre-COVID-19 era (from April 2019 to March 2020) and the COVID-19 era (from April 2020 to March 2021) in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. We extracted data on total TB detection rate, TB treatment success rate, isoniazid prophylaxis therapy, and drug susceptibility tests and others from the health information system. Using Poisson regression, we estimated the incidence rate ratios and the absolute number difference of the indicators (number per quarter and year) in the COVID-19 and pre-COVID-19 eras. Results Compared with the pre-COVID-19 era, the total TB detection, bacteriologically confirmed TB, TB treatment success rate, latent TB infection treatment and community health workers' engagement in TB detection decreased, respectively, by 11%, 11.8%, 17%, 44.7% and 77.2% during the COVID-19 period. Rifampicin resistance increased by 27.7% during the same period. Comparative analysis showed a significant decline in these TB service indicators (p<0.001) Conclusion The COVID-19 pandemic has had a negative impact on TB service indicators in Addis Ababa.

Question: Given [Boosting immune response with GM-CSF optimizes primary cryotherapy outcomes in the treatment of prostate cancer: a prospective randomized clinical trial. Objective: We explored the association of prostate cryotherapy and immunomodulation with granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GMCSF) in the generation of detectable tumor-specific T- and B-cell responses in men with prostate cancer. Materials and methods: A randomized pilot study of patients assigned to either cryotherapy alone (Control group) or in combination with GMCSF (Treatment group). The impact of therapy on the development of T- and B-cell responses against tumor-related antigens was studied using enzyme-linked immune absorbent spot (ELISpot) and protein microarray panels (Sematrix) assays, respectively. Fold changes in response to treatment were calculated by normalization of post-treatment ELISpot values against the mean pre-cryoablation response. Student t tests between treatment and control groups at 4 weeks and 12 weeks across all the antigens were performed. Results: A total of 20 patients were randomized to either control or treatment arm. At 4 weeks after cryotherapy, the treatment group demonstrated an average fold change in cancer antigen-related antibodies of 2.8% above their mean baseline values, whereas controls averaged an 18% change below mean baseline (p < 0.05). At 12 weeks, antibody response in treatment group increased to 25% above baseline, while the average of control group patients remained 9% below baseline (p < 0.05). Patients in treatment group displayed, on average, higher ELISPOT readings for the 4- and 12-week times points (527 vs 481 for PSA and 748 vs 562 for PAP). Conclusions: GMCSF appeared to broadly elevate antibodies against prostate-specific and nonspecific antigens. Prostate antigen-specific T-cell responses were more enhanced over non-prostate-specific responses, preferentially in the treatment group.

Question: Given [SARS-CoV-2 vaccination does not induce relapses of patients with inflammatory bowel disease. Background Vaccination against SARS-CoV-2 is a promising strategy to protect immunocompromised IBD patients from a severe course of COVID-19. As these patients were excluded from initial clinical vaccination trials, patients frequently express concerns regarding the safety of these vaccines, especially whether vaccination might trigger IBD flares (hit-and-run-hypothesis). Methods In order to assess the risk of an IBD flare after vaccination against SARS-CoV-2, an anonymous survey was performed at five German IBD centers and one patient organization (Deutsche Morbus Crohn/Colitis ulcerosa Vereinigung (DCCV) e.V.) in August and October 2021. Results The questionnaire was answered by 914 patients, 781 of whom reported a previous vaccination against SARS-CoV-2 (85.4%). Vaccination against SARS-CoV-2 was not associated with an increased risk of IBD flares (p=0.319) or unscheduled visits to the IBD physician (p=0.848). Furthermore, typical symptoms of an IBD flare including abdominal pain, increases in stool frequency, or rectal bleeding were not influenced by the vaccination. Conclusion Vaccination against SARS-CoV-2 is safe in IBD patients. These results may help to reduce fears regarding the vaccination in IBD patients.

Question: Given [Improving rates of venous thromboembolism prophylaxis in multiple myeloma patients on immunomodulatory drugs through a pharmacy-based system. Introduction: Immunomodulatory drugs used to treat multiple myeloma carry an increased risk of venous thromboembolic (VTE) disease. Previously published guidelines outline consensus opinion on how to mitigate this risk. Methods: We collected baseline data to analyze how these strategies are utilized at our single institution and sought to improve the rates of anticoagulation for high-risk patients. This was done through a quality improvement project that added pharmacy/haematology oversight to the VTE risk assessment. Results: Thirty-nine patients newly started on IMiDs were assessed for VTE risk. This information was passed on to the myeloma provider for consideration. Twenty-two patients were classified as high risk for VTE. Of the high-risk patients, 14 (64%) were placed on an anticoagulant for thromboprophylaxis. Eleven (79%) of the 14 used direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs). Eight high-risk patients did not receive an anticoagulant for thromboprophylaxis; 4 of these developed VTE. No patients on anticoagulation developed a VTE. This strategy had rare minor bleeding complications. Conclusion: This quality action verifies guideline-based thromboprophylaxis in multiple myeloma and supports the benefit of pharmacy oversight in improving VTE rates.

Question: Given [Male genital lichen planus: A retrospective study of 89 cases. Background: Unlike other types of lichen planus (LP), there are no series concerning male genital LP. Objective: To describe the clinical characteristics, diagnosis, and response to treatment of male genital LP. Patients and methods: A retrospective study of male patients with genital LP consulting a dermatologist specialized in anogenital diseases between January 2010 and 2019. Demographic data, history, functional signs, clinical characteristics, pathology, complications, and treatment efficacy were collected. Results: Eighty-nine patients were included at four centers. The median age was 51 years. Most patients were uncircumcised and asymptomatic. In 88.8% of cases, only the genital mucosa was involved. Erythema (71%), papules (21.3%), lacy network (15.7%), atrophic lesions (15.7%), erosions (14.6%), and post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation (2.2%) were less frequently observed. Biopsy results confirmed LP in 61.3% of cases but could not rule out other inflammatory genital dermatoses in other cases. Anatomic complications were observed in 30.3% of patients. Topical corticosteroids (TCS) induced remission in most cases. Tacrolimus efficacy was comparable to that of TCS. Conclusion: Male genital LP is a rare inflammatory disorder chiefly affecting uncircumcised men. It is found predominantly on the mucosal component of the penis and presents as non-erosive inflammatory balanitis in most cases, with frequent partial or complete remission on treatment with TCS.] you can imply that [Topical corticosteroids are effective for the treatment of male genital lichen planus in all cases.].

Question: Given [In vitro activity of immunosuppressive agents against Cryptococcus neoformans. Introduction: Infections caused by Cryptococcus neoformans are a major cause of fungal mortality in HIV-infected/AIDS patients and in those receiving organ transplants. We evaluated the in vitro activity of tacrolimus and cyclosporine in combination with amphotericin B and fluconazole against C. neoformans. Methods: MICs were determined against a total of 30 clinical isolates of C. neoformans by the microdilution method following the CLSI M27-A3 guidelines and by the checkerboard method. Results: Tacrolimus and cyclosporine A showed in vitro activity against cryptococcal isolates. The combination of amphotericin B with cyclosporine A or tacrolimus was synergistic against 90% and 30% of isolates, respectively. Synergism was also observed with the combination of fluconazole with cyclosporine A or tacrolimus, against 70% and 20% of isolates, respectively. Conclusions: The synergistic interactions between the calcineurin inhibitors and antifungal drugs against C. neoformans isolates, could potentially have a role in devising novel therapeutic strategies for this opportunistic mycosis.] you can imply that [The synergistic interaction between calcineurin inhibitors and antifungal drugs is being used as a therapeutic strategy for infections caused by Cryptococcus neoformans.].

Question: Given [Chronic pleuritis and recurrent pleural effusion after atezolizumab for small cell lung cancer. Background: As use of immune checkpoint inhibitors consistently grows, so does knowledge of immune-related adverse events. Pleural complications from PD-L1 inhibitors such as atezolizumab have never been reported. We de-scribe the first reported case of biopsy-proven pleuritis manifesting as recurrent pleural effusion in a patient treated with atezolizumab. A 66-year-old woman with history of extensive-stage small cell lung cancer presented with a new pleural effu-sion. She was previously treated with carboplatin, etoposide, and atezolizumab followed by atezolizumab main-tenance, but this later was stopped due to pneumonitis. She had been on no systemic therapy for 6 months prior; radiation to the chest was completed 1 year earlier. Thoracentesis revealed an exudate with eosinophil-ia but no malignancy. She underwent medical thoracoscopy, which showed normal pleura with no evidence of radiation changes. Random pleural biopsies revealed only chronic pleuritis. Given normal-appearing pleu-ra, radiation pleuritis was ruled out. It was felt that the chemotherapy had occurred too long ago to be a present cause of her pleuritis. As such, after extensive workup, the eosinophilic pleural effusion was felt to be due to pleuritis from atezolizumab. The effusion has ultimately recurred 5 times over 1 year, and cytology remains negative for malignancy. Patients with prior cancer presenting with a new pleural effusion should undergo an extensive workup to evaluate for recurrence.

Question: Given [A Honeycomb-Like Bismuth/Manganese Oxide Nanoparticle with Mutual Reinforcement of Internal and External Response for Triple-Negative Breast Cancer Targeted Therapy. Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) exhibits aggressive behavior and high levels of metastasis owing to its complex heterogeneous structure and lack of specific receptors.

The extra-high drug load Bi@Bi2O3@MnOx NPs (honey-comb like structure) are formed by Kirkendall effect and electrostatic attraction. After modified with CM, they can home into tumor sites precisely, where they respond to internal overexpressed glutathione (GSH), releasing Mn2+ for chemodynamic therapy (CDT) with GSH depletion, while H2O2 degrades into O2 enabling relief of tumor hypoxia. In response to external near-infrared irradiation, mBMNI NPs intelligently generate vigorous heat and single oxygen (1O2) for photothermal therapy (PTT) and photodynamic therapy (PDT) owing to high load.

Rotational thromboelastography was performed in 76 patients to study clot formation dynamics. Our study demonstrated that patients with COVID-19 had increased blood viscosity despite lower hematocrit than healthy individuals, as well as increased RBC aggregation. In-vitro experiments demonstrated a strong contribution of plasma fibrinogen in this RBC hyper-aggregation. RBC aggregation correlated positively with clot firmness, negatively with clot formation time, and positively with the length of hospitalization. Patients with oxygen supplementation had higher RBC aggregation and blood viscosity than those without, and patients with pulmonary lesions had higher RBC aggregation and enhanced coagulation than those without.

Question: Given [Induction of EnR stress by Melatonin enhances the cytotoxic effect of Lapatinib in HER2-positive breast cancer. Despite HER2-targeted cancer treatments have provided considerable clinical benefits, resistance to HER2-targeted agents will inevitably develop. Targeting non-oncogene vulnerabilities including endoplasmic reticulum (EnR) stress has emerged as an attractive alternative approach to improve the efficacy of existing targeted cancer therapies. In the current study, we find that Melatonin sensitizes HER2-positive breast cancer cells to the dual tyrosine kinase inhibitor Lapatinib in vitro. Mechanistically, Melatonin enhances the cytotoxic effects of Lapatinib through promoting excessive EnR stress-induced unfolded protein response (UPR) and ROS overaccumulation. Consistently, the antioxidant N-acetylcysteine remarkably reverses the effects of the drug combination on ROS production, DNA damage and cytotoxicity. Furthermore, Melatonin significantly enhances the anti-tumor effect of Lapatinib in an HCC1954 xenograft model. Meanwhile, Lapatinib resistant HER2-positive breast cancer cells (LapR) display lower basal expression levels of UPR genes and enhanced tolerance to EnR stress with attenuated response to Brefeldin A and Tunicamycin. Importantly, Melatonin also increases the sensitivity of HCC1954 LapR cells to Lapatinib.

Despite HER2-targeted cancer treatments have provided considerable clinical benefits, resistance to HER2-targeted agents will inevitably develop. Targeting non-oncogene vulnerabilities including endoplasmic reticulum (EnR) stress has emerged as an attractive alternative approach to improve the efficacy of existing targeted cancer therapies. In the current study, we find that Melatonin sensitizes HER2-positive breast cancer cells to the dual tyrosine kinase inhibitor Lapatinib in vitro. Mechanistically, Melatonin enhances the cytotoxic effects of Lapatinib through promoting excessive EnR stress-induced unfolded protein response (UPR) and ROS overaccumulation. Consistently, the antioxidant N-acetylcysteine remarkably reverses the effects of the drug combination on ROS production, DNA damage and cytotoxicity. Furthermore, Melatonin significantly enhances the anti-tumor effect of Lapatinib in an HCC1954 xenograft model. Meanwhile, Lapatinib resistant HER2-positive breast cancer cells (LapR) display lower basal expression levels of UPR genes and enhanced tolerance to EnR stress with attenuated response to Brefeldin A and Tunicamycin. Importantly, Melatonin also increases the sensitivity of HCC1954 LapR cells to Lapatinib. Together, our findings highlight the potential utility of Melatonin as an adjuvant in the treatment of primary or therapy resistant HER2-positive breast cancer via EnR stress-mediated mechanisms.] you can imply that [Melatonin can be used as an adjuvant in the treatment of primary or therapy resistant HER2-positive breast cancer.].

Question: Given [Juvenile idiopathic arthritis-associated chronic uveitis: Recent therapeutic approaches. Pediatric patients with early onset (before the age of 6 years), antinuclear antibody positive, oligoarticular or polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA), and some children with no arthritis may develop chronic, anterior uveitis. Recent recommendations insist on the need to perform slit lamp examination every 3 months for at least 5 years in early onset JIA patients in order to diagnose uveitis before complications develop. Local steroid therapy is usually the first-line treatment. However, in patients requiring steroid eye drops for several months, systemic immunomodulatory therapy is indicated. Methotrexate (MTX) is then prescribed in most cases; however, some patients also need anti-tumor necrosis factor alpha monoclonal antibody therapy and, in some cases, other biologics to control uveitis and avoid long-term ocular damage. Expert ophthalmologists and pediatricians must be involved in taking care of such patients. Immunomodulatory treatment must not be too easily interrupted and may even be intensified in some cases, particularly if there is a need for optimal disease control before ophthalmologic surgery. In good responders to MTX and/or biologics, treatment must be maintained at least 1 year, possibly even 2 years after achieving remission before tapering treatment intensity.] you can assume that [Anti-tumor necrosis factor alpha monoclonal antibody therapy is efficient in treating juvenile idiopathic arthritis-associated chronic uveitis.].

Question: Given [Infantile Spasms and Trisomy 21: Unfavorable Outcomes with First-line Vigabatrin Therapy. Introduction: Among children with infantile spasms (ISs), those with trisomy 21 (T21) and those with normal development at onset and no identifiable etiology (previously referred to as idiopathic) are expected to have relatively favorable outcomes. The study objective is to determine if differences exist in treatment response, relapse, and subsequent epilepsy between these two groups when vigabatrin is used as first-line treatment. Methods: In this retrospective study, patients were classified into the following groups and clinical features were compared: T21 (n = 24) and IS with normal development at onset and no identified etiology (n = 40; control group). Results: There was no significant difference in the age of IS onset, sex distribution, or treatment lag between the groups. The T21 compared to the control group required a higher mean number of anti-seizure therapies (3.6 vs. 1.9, p < 0.001), had more relapses [10 (42%) vs. 4 (10%), p < 0.005)], and had higher risk of subsequent epilepsy [11 (46%) vs. 8 (20%), p < 0.003]. Relapses were often delayed in the T21 group, with a mean of 8 months after IS cessation. Conclusion: Our results differ from most studies using steroids as first-line treatment where the groups were shown to have similar treatment response and T21 patients had a low risk of relapse and subsequent epilepsy. Therefore, our results suggest that vigabatrin as first-line treatment in T21 with IS may be less favorable than steroids.

Question: Given [Real-Time Analysis of Antiproliferative Effects of Mouthwashes Containing Alcohol, Sodium Fluoride, Cetylpyridinium Chloride, and Chlorhexidine in Vitro. Objectives. In this study, the cytotoxic responses of six different over-the-counter mouthwashes on L929 cells were analyzed by two different techniques: the traditional colorimetric tetrazolium-based reduction assay (MTT) and the modern impedance-based real-time cell analysis (RTCA) system to investigate their biocompatibility in vitro. Thus, the investigation of the antiproliferative effects of the specified materials via different techniques is vital to reach this goal. Materials and Methods. First, L929 mouse fibroblasts were exposed to the dilutions of mouthwashes for 2 minutes. After incubation, the tetrazolium reduction method was used to assess the metabolic viability of cells measured by colorimetric MTT assay and morphological inspection of cells was performed via phase-contrast microscopy. Furthermore, the effect of each mouthwash on the proliferation, morphology, and adhesion of L929 cells was monitored continuously by a noninvasive and label-free RTCA system for 140 h. Results. Our data showed that all of the mouthwashes had varying cytotoxic effects on fibroblasts compared to the control group in MTT assay. In addition to that, RTCA technology has provided the growth kinetic profiles that can be used to analyze if the treatment is causing antimitotic or DNA-damaging effect on cells. Thus, analysis via this system can tell us the mechanism of toxicity behind the cell growth inhibition in vitro. Here, we found that only mouthwash 1 moderately maintained the viability of the L929 cells, yet displaying antimitotic effects and the other mouthwashes (mouthwash 2-mouthwash 6) showed toxicity via DNA-damaging effects. Conclusions. Of the six types of mouthwash tested, the most biocompatible result was obtained from a mouthwash containing alcohol (i.e., mouthwash 1).

Question: Given [Factors Influencing Change in Serum Uric Acid After Administration of the Sodium-Glucose Cotransporter 2 Inhibitor Luseogliflozin in Patients With Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus. Although sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors lower serum uric acid, their long-term effect on uric acid metabolism is not well understood. We analyzed pooled data from studies wherein patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus received luseogliflozin, an SGLT2 inhibitor. Upon stratifying patients by baseline glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) or serum uric acid, lower HbA1c or higher serum uric acid level was associated with a greater reduction in serum uric acid after treatment. At week 12 of treatment, significant increases in urinary glucose/creatinine (Cr) ratio and urinary uric acid clearance/Cr clearance ratio (CUA/CCr ratio) and a significant reduction in serum uric acid were observed. Comparison of the subgroups of patients with a reduction or an increase in serum uric acid showed that the increase subgroup had a higher estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) at baseline, and the eGFR was significantly reduced, associated with a significant reduction in the CUA/CCr ratio. Multiple regression analysis showed that the reduction in serum uric acid in the luseogliflozin group was strongly associated with baseline high serum uric acid, low HbA1c levels, and an increase in eGFR.

Question: Given [Influence of flexible gelatinous coating layer on electrochemical performance and fatigue failure of lithium battery separator. Recently, the battery security issue receives widespread attention. Investigating the compression performance and failure mode of the battery separator, and then simulating the internal soft short-circuit of the battery due to separator rupture becomes the current focus. In this work, commercial polyethylene separators are coated with a Al2O3 composite organic silicone - acrylic acid gel layer and the electrochemical performance are characterized. The coated battery separator (PEAE-5) exhibits the lowest charge transfer resistance and increases the electrochemical stability window to 5.3 V, since the silicone exhibits oxidation resistance and the acrylic provides flexibility in polar electrolyte solvents. Subsequently, the battery separator is punched in cycles to simulate fatigue failure of the separator under external compression. The results indicate that the separator (PEAE-5) coated with a 5% solid content of organic silicone - acrylic acid emulsion exhibits the best combined physical-mechanical and electrochemical properties, maintaining nearly 80% of the original cycling performance after 50 cycles of compression. The separator coated with the composite organic silicone - acrylic acid gel layer suffers the least from cycle fatigue. The existence of the flexible gelatinous coating layer affords an efficient method to protect the battery separator from destruction.] you can assume that [Acrylic acid gel protects against lithium-caused fatigue.].

Question: Given [Factors Influencing Change in Serum Uric Acid After Administration of the Sodium-Glucose Cotransporter 2 Inhibitor Luseogliflozin in Patients With Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus. Although sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors lower serum uric acid, their long-term effect on uric acid metabolism is not well understood. We analyzed pooled data from studies wherein patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus received luseogliflozin, an SGLT2 inhibitor. Upon stratifying patients by baseline glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) or serum uric acid, lower HbA1c or higher serum uric acid level was associated with a greater reduction in serum uric acid after treatment. At week 12 of treatment, significant increases in urinary glucose/creatinine (Cr) ratio and urinary uric acid clearance/Cr clearance ratio (CUA/CCr ratio) and a significant reduction in serum uric acid were observed. Comparison of the subgroups of patients with a reduction or an increase in serum uric acid showed that the increase subgroup had a higher estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) at baseline, and the eGFR was significantly reduced, associated with a significant reduction in the CUA/CCr ratio. Multiple regression analysis showed that the reduction in serum uric acid in the luseogliflozin group was strongly associated with baseline high serum uric acid, low HbA1c levels, and an increase in eGFR.

Question: Given [Identifying high dose neostigmine as a risk factor for post-operative respiratory complications: A case-control study. Background: Neostigmine, an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor, is used to reverse the effects of non-depolarizing neuromuscular blocking agents. Inappropriate dosing of neostigmine can lead to post-operative respiratory complications. Post-operative respiratory complications are associated with major morbidity and mortality. The purpose of this case-control study was to determine neuromuscular blockade-related risk factors associated with post-operative respiratory complications (specifically, reintubation, respiratory insufficiency, hypoxia, and/or aspiration). Methods: We performed an Institutional Review Board-approved case-control study of all patients who underwent a general anesthetic requiring neuromuscular blockade at Tufts Medical Center between March 22, 2013 and June 1, 2019. Cases were patients who experienced post-operative complications. We identified 58 controls and 116 cases from a database of 130,178 patients during the 74-month study period. Results: After adjusting for covariates, the administration of high dose neostigmine (> 60 mg per kg ideal body weight) was associated with increased odds of post-operative respiratory complications (odds ratio = 8.2; 95% CI: 2.5-26.6, P < 0.001). Rocuronium dose and the use of train-of-four peripheral nerve stimulator were not associated with post-operative respiratory complications. Conclusions: High dose neostigmine was identified as an independent risk factor for post-operative respiratory complications.

Inhaled epoprostenol (iEPO) has been introduced worldwide as a cost-saving alternative to iNO without high-grade evidence for this indication. Objective: To investigate whether the use of iEPO will lead to similar rates of severe/grade 3 primary graft dysfunction (PGD-3) after adult LT when compared with use of iNO. Design, Setting, and Participants: This health system-funded, randomized, blinded (to participants, clinicians, data managers, and the statistician), parallel-designed, equivalence clinical trial included 201 adult patients who underwent single or bilateral LT between May 30, 2017, and March 21, 2020. Patients were grouped into 5 strata according to key prognostic clinical features and randomized per stratum to receive either iNO or iEPO at the time of LT via 1:1 treatment allocation. Interventions: Treatment with iNO or iEPO initiated in the operating room before lung allograft reperfusion and administered continously until cessation criteria met in the intensive care unit (ICU). Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary outcome was PGD-3 development at 24, 48, or 72 hours after LT. The primary analysis was for equivalence using a two one-sided test (TOST) procedure (90% CI) with a margin of 19% for between-group PGD-3 risk difference. Secondary outcomes included duration of mechanical ventilation, hospital and ICU lengths of stay, incidence and severity of acute kidney injury, postoperative tracheostomy placement, and in-hospital, 30-day, and 90-day mortality rates. An intention-to-treat analysis was performed for the primary and secondary outcomes, supplemented by per-protocol analysis for the primary outcome. Results: A total of 201 randomized patients met eligibility criteria at the time of LT (129 men [64.2%]). In the intention-to-treat population, 103 patients received iEPO and 98 received iNO. The primary outcome occurred in 46 of 103 patients (44.7%) in the iEPO group and 39 of 98 (39.8%) in the iNO group, leading to a risk difference of 4.9% (TOST 90% CI, -6.4% to 16.2%; P =.02 for equivalence). There were no significant between-group differences for secondary outcomes.

Question: Given [Differences in medication usage of dental patients by age, gender, race/ethnicity and insurance status. BACKGROUND: Limited studies have investigated the medication profile of young adult dental patients despite the high prevalence of prescription opioid abuse in this population. OBJECTIVE: This study investigated the extent and differences in medication usage of dental patients older than 18 years by age, race/ethnicity, gender, insurance status and mechanism of action in an academic dental clinic setting. METHODS: Using an automated approach, medication names in the electronic dental record were retrieved and classified according to the National Drug Code directory. Descriptive statistics, multivariable ANOVA and Post hoc tests were performed to detect differences in the number of medications by patient demographics. RESULTS: Of the 11,220 adult patients, 53 percent reported taking at least one medication with significant differences in medication usage by demographics. Hydroxymethylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase inhibitors (21-36%), and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (19-23%) ranked the top two medication classes among patients 55 years and older. Opioid agonists (7-14%), and Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors (SSRIs) (5-12%) ranked the top two medication classes among patients aged 18-54 years. CONCLUSIONS: The results underscore the importance of dental providers to review medical and medication histories of patients regardless of their age to avoid adverse events and to determine patient's risk for opioid abuse.

Question: Given [Initial dose reduction of enzalutamide does not decrease the incidence of adverse events in castration-resistant prostate cancer. Background There was no clear evidence whether the initial dose of enzalutamide affects the incidence of adverse events (AEs), and oncological outcome in patients with castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC). Methods The clinical charts of 233 patients with CRPC treated with enzalutamide were reviewed retrospectively. After 1:3 propensity score matching (PSM), 124 patients were divided into a reduced dose group and a standard dose group, and the prostate specific antigen (PSA) response and the incidence of AEs were compared. Results 190 patients with CRPC initiated with standard dose enzalutamide were younger and better performance status compared with 43 patients beginning with reduced dose. After PSM, the baseline characteristics were not different between the standard and the reduced dose group. In the PSM cohort, the PSA response rate was significantly lower in the reduced dose group than in the standard dose group (-66.3% and -87.4%, p = 0.02). The incidence rates of AEs were not statistically different between the groups (22.6% and 34.4%, respectively, p = 0.24). Conclusion Initiating treatment with a reduced dose of enzalutamide did not significantly decrease the incidence rate of AEs, and it showed poorer PSA response rate.

Question: Given [Case Report: Cutaneous Pleomorphic Lymphangiosarcoma in a Dog Exhibiting Features of Human Composite Hemangioendothelioma. Background: Angiosarcomas are a broad category of vascular origin neoplasms that are poorly characterized in veterinary species. Lymphangiosarcoma (LAS) is an uncommon type of angiosarcoma reported in humans and canines arising from lymphatic endothelium. LAS can be differentiated from other angiosarcomas in dogs based on expression of Prospero-related homeobox gene-1 (PROX-1) or lymphatic vessel endothelial receptor-1 (LYVE-1). Composite hemangioendothelioma (CHE) is a rare angiosarcoma subtype described in people and characterized by a variable biologic behavior and infrequent metastasis. This variant of angiosarcoma histologically combines features of retiform hemangioendothelioma and epithelioid hemangioendothelioma. Information regarding the cytologic and histopathologic appearance and clinical course of dogs with vascular tumors that exhibit features of CHE are unknown. Here, we report a case of pleomorphic LAS with features of CHE arising in a dog and treated with surgery and adjuvant chemotherapy. Case presentation: A 10-year-old intact male Labrador retriever presented with an approximately 6-cm-diameter cutaneous mass caudal to the left elbow that was progressively growing over 1.5 years. On physical examination, palpable extensions were identified coursing proximally over the triceps with concurrent loco-regional peripheral lymphadenopathy. Fine needle aspirates (FNA) and cytologic assessment of the cutaneous mass, left prescapular, and accessory axillary lymph nodes reported that this appeared to be a metastatic epithelial neoplasm, although a mixed carcinoma or collision tumor could not be excluded. An incisional biopsy of the mass was submitted for histopathology and was consistent with a well-differentiated angiosarcoma with features of CHE. The neoplasm expressed vimentin, CD31, von Willebrand factor (vWf), and PROX-1, supporting the diagnosis of LAS. Complete staging was performed, and no additional metastatic lesions were identified. Left forelimb amputation and lymph node removal were performed. Based on the diagnosis of metastatic LAS, doxorubicin chemotherapy was administered. 7 months post-amputation, the tumor recurred at the amputation site without evidence of metastatic disease. Conclusion: This report describes a malignant, locally aggressive lymphatic origin vascular tumor in a dog, with features consistent with descriptions of CHE in humans. Cytologic features in this case were discordant with its true mesenchymal etiology, obfuscating diagnosis.

Question: Given [International Society for the Study of Women's Sexual Health Clinical Practice Guideline for the Use of Systemic Testosterone for Hypoactive Sexual Desire Disorder in Women. Aim: To provide a clinical practice guideline for the use of testosterone including identification of patients, laboratory testing, dosing, post-treatment monitoring, and follow-up care in women with hypoactive sexual desire disorder (HSDD). Methods: The International Society for the Study of Women's Sexual Health appointed a multidisciplinary panel of experts who performed a literature review of original research, meta-analyses, review papers, and consensus guidelines regarding testosterone use in women. Consensus was reached using a modified Delphi method. Outcomes: A clinically useful guideline following a biopsychosocial assessment and treatment approach for the safe and efficacious use of testosterone in women with HSDD was developed including measurement, indications, formulations, prescribing, dosing, monitoring, and follow-up. Results: Although the Global Position Statement endorses testosterone therapy for only postmenopausal women, limited data also support the use in late reproductive age premenopausal women, consistent with the International Society for the Study of Women's Sexual Health Process of Care for the Management of HSDD. Systemic transdermal testosterone is recommended for women with HSDD not primarily related to modifiable factors or comorbidities such as relationship or mental health problems. Current available research supports a moderate therapeutic benefit. Safety data show no serious adverse events with physiologic testosterone use, but long-term safety has not been established. Before initiation of therapy, clinicians should provide an informed consent. Shared decision-making involves a comprehensive discussion of off-label use, as well as benefits and risks. A total testosterone level should not be used to diagnose HSDD, but as a baseline for monitoring. Government-approved transdermal male formulations can be used cautiously with dosing appropriate for women. Patients should be assessed for signs of androgen excess and total testosterone levels monitored to maintain concentrations in the physiologic premenopausal range. Compounded products cannot be recommended because of the lack of efficacy and safety data. Clinical implications: This clinical practice guideline provides standards for safely prescribing testosterone to women with HSDD, including identification of appropriate patients, dosing, and monitoring. Strengths and limitations: This evidence-based guideline builds on a recently published comprehensive meta-analysis and the Global Position Statement endorsed by numerous societies. The limitation is that testosterone therapy is not approved for women by most regulatory agencies, thereby making prescribing and proper dosing challenging. Conclusion: Despite substantial evidence regarding safety, efficacy, and clinical use, access to testosterone therapy for the treatment of HSDD in women remains a significant unmet need.] you can assume that [Systemic transdermal testosterone is effective in women with hypoactive sexual desire disorder.].

Question: Given [Raloxifene in the Treatment of Osteoporosis in Postmenopausal Women with End-Stage Renal Disease: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis. As a selective estrogen receptor modulator (SERM), raloxifene is used in healthy postmenopausal women to prevent bone loss and reduce fractures. However, the benefit of raloxifene is uncertain in the treatment of osteoporosis among patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) or those who require maintenance dialysis.

Question: Given [Inulin Fermentable Fiber Ameliorates Type I Diabetes via IL22 and Short-Chain Fatty Acids in Experimental Models. Background & Aims: Nourishment of gut microbiota via consumption of fermentable fiber promotes gut health and guards against metabolic syndrome. In contrast, how dietary fiber impacts type 1 diabetes is less clear. Methods: To examine impact of dietary fibers on development of type 1 diabetes in the streptozotocin (STZ)-induced and spontaneous non-obese diabetes (NOD) models, mice were fed grain-based chow (GBC) or compositionally defined diets enriched with a fermentable fiber (inulin) or an insoluble fiber (cellulose). Spontaneous (NOD mice) or STZ-induced (wild-type mice) diabetes was monitored. Results: Relative to GBC, low-fiber diets exacerbated STZ-induced diabetes, whereas diets enriched with inulin, but not cellulose, strongly protected against or treated it. Inulin's restoration of glycemic control prevented loss of adipose depots, while reducing food and water consumption. Inulin normalized pancreatic function and markedly enhanced insulin sensitivity. Such amelioration of diabetes was associated with alterations in gut microbiota composition and was eliminated by antibiotic administration. Pharmacologic blockade of fermentation reduced inulin's beneficial impact on glycemic control, indicating a role for short-chain fatty acids (SCFA). Furthermore, inulin's microbiota-dependent anti-diabetic effect associated with SCFA-independent restoration of interleukin 22, which was necessary and sufficient to ameliorate STZ-induced diabetes. Inulin-enriched diets significantly delayed diabetes in NOD mice. Conclusions: Fermentable fiber confers microbiota-dependent increases in SCFA and interleukin 22 that, together, may have potential to prevent and/or treat type 1 diabetes.] you can assume that [Fermentable fiber can be used in the prevention of type 1 diabetes.].

Question: Given [Inulin Fermentable Fiber Ameliorates Type I Diabetes via IL22 and Short-Chain Fatty Acids in Experimental Models. Background & Aims: Nourishment of gut microbiota via consumption of fermentable fiber promotes gut health and guards against metabolic syndrome. In contrast, how dietary fiber impacts type 1 diabetes is less clear. Methods: To examine impact of dietary fibers on development of type 1 diabetes in the streptozotocin (STZ)-induced and spontaneous non-obese diabetes (NOD) models, mice were fed grain-based chow (GBC) or compositionally defined diets enriched with a fermentable fiber (inulin) or an insoluble fiber (cellulose). Spontaneous (NOD mice) or STZ-induced (wild-type mice) diabetes was monitored. Results: Relative to GBC, low-fiber diets exacerbated STZ-induced diabetes, whereas diets enriched with inulin, but not cellulose, strongly protected against or treated it. Inulin's restoration of glycemic control prevented loss of adipose depots, while reducing food and water consumption. Inulin normalized pancreatic function and markedly enhanced insulin sensitivity. Such amelioration of diabetes was associated with alterations in gut microbiota composition and was eliminated by antibiotic administration. Pharmacologic blockade of fermentation reduced inulin's beneficial impact on glycemic control, indicating a role for short-chain fatty acids (SCFA). Furthermore, inulin's microbiota-dependent anti-diabetic effect associated with SCFA-independent restoration of interleukin 22, which was necessary and sufficient to ameliorate STZ-induced diabetes. Inulin-enriched diets significantly delayed diabetes in NOD mice. Conclusions: Fermentable fiber confers microbiota-dependent increases in SCFA and interleukin 22 that, together, may have potential to prevent and/or treat type 1 diabetes.] you can infer that [Fermentable fiber can be used in the prevention of type 1 diabetes.].

Question: Given [Raloxifene in the Treatment of Osteoporosis in Postmenopausal Women with End-Stage Renal Disease: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis. As a selective estrogen receptor modulator (SERM), raloxifene is used in healthy postmenopausal women to prevent bone loss and reduce fractures. However, the benefit of raloxifene is uncertain in the treatment of osteoporosis among patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) or those who require maintenance dialysis. We assessed the safety and efficacy of raloxifene in this particular population. Studies were selected from PubMed, Springer, CNKI (Chinese National Knowledge Infrastructure) and Wanfang Database. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and prospective studies with control/placebo groups were included. Five studies were included with a total of 244 participants (121 patients in the raloxifene group and 123 patients in the placebo/control group). The median duration of treatment was 12 months. The incidence rate of side effects of raloxifene was 0/121 (0%). There was a significant improvement of lumbar spine bone mineral density (BMD) levels in the raloxifene group compared with the placebo group (MD: 33.88, 95% CI: 10.93, 56.84, p=0.004). There was no significant difference concerning the improvement of femoral neck BMD (MD: 8.42, 95% CI: -10.21, 27.04, p=0.38), intact parathyroid hormone (iPTH) (MD: -12.62, 95% CI: -35.36, 10.13, p=0.28), calcium (MD: -0.08, 95% CI: -0.61, 0.44, p=0.76), phosphorus (MD: 0.18, 95% CI: -0.12, 0.48, p=0.23) or bone alkaline phosphatase (BAP) (MD: -4.33, 95% CI: -14.44, 5.79, p=0.40). Raloxifene seems to be effective in improving the lumbar spine BMD in postmenopausal women with ESRD.

Question: Given [Ipilimumab alone or in combination with nivolumab in patients with advanced melanoma who have progressed or relapsed on PD-1 blockade: Clinical outcomes and translational biomarker analyses. Background There are no validated biomarkers that can aid clinicians in selecting who would best benefit from anticytotoxic T lymphocyte-associated antigen 4 monotherapy versus combination checkpoint blockade in patients with advanced melanoma who have progressive disease after programmed death 1 (PD-1) blockade. Methods We conducted a randomized multicenter phase II trial in patients with advanced melanoma. Patients were randomly assigned to receive either 1 mg/kg of nivolumab plus 3 mg/kg of ipilimumab or 3 mg/kg of ipilimumab every 3 weeks for up to four doses. Patients were stratified by histological subtype and prior response to PD-1 therapy. The primary clinical objective was overall response rate by week 18. Translational biomarker analyses were conducted in patients with blood and tissue samples. Results Objective responses were seen in 5 of 9 patients in the ipilimumab arm and 2 of 10 patients in the ipilimumab+nivolumab arm; disease control rates (DCRs) (66.7% vs 60.0%) and rates of grade 3-4 adverse events (56% vs 50%) were comparable between arms. In a pooled analysis, patients with clinical benefit (CB), defined as Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors response or progression-free for 6 months, showed increased circulating CD4+ T cells with higher polyfunctionality and interferon gamma production following treatment.

Question: Given [Midodrine for the Prevention of Vasovagal Syncope. Background: Recurrent vasovagal syncope is common, responds poorly to treatment, and causes physical trauma and poor quality of life. Midodrine prevents hypotension and syncope during tilt tests in patients with vasovagal syncope. Objective: To determine whether midodrine can prevent vasovagal syncope in usual clinical conditions. Design: Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial. (ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT01456481) Setting: 25 university hospitals in Canada, the United States, Mexico, and the United Kingdom. Patients: Patients with recurrent vasovagal syncope and no serious comorbid conditions. Intervention: Patients were randomly assigned 1:1 to placebo or midodrine and followed for 12 months. Measurements: The primary outcome measure was the proportion of patients with at least 1 syncope episode during follow-up. Results: The study included 133 patients who had had a median of 6 syncope episodes in the prior year (median age, 32 years; 73% female). Compared with patients receiving placebo, fewer patients receiving midodrine had at least 1 syncope episode (28 of 66 [42%] vs. 41 of 67 [61%]). The relative risk was 0.69 (95% CI, 0.49 to 0.97; P = 0.035). The absolute risk reduction was 19 percentage points (CI, 2 to 36 percentage points), and the number needed to treat to prevent 1 patient from having syncope was 5.3 (CI, 2.8 to 47.6). The time to first syncope was longer with midodrine (hazard ratio, 0.59 [CI, 0.37 to 0.96]; P = 0.035; log-rank P = 0.031). Adverse effects were similar in both groups. Limitation: Small study size, young and healthy patients, relatively short observation period, and high proportion of patients from 1 center.

Three years with Nilotinib, the patient developed a persistent pancytopenia grade 4 while a major molecular response was achieved. Management & Outcome: Nilotinib was discontinued. However, the hematologic finding of the patient had not recovered after three months. A bone marrow biopsy showed marked hypocellularity and fatty tissue without evidence of myelofibrosis. Immunosuppressive therapy was started. Unfortunately, the patient died due to septic and hemorrhagic shock nine months after Nilotinib interruption. According to Naranjo's algorithm, the causality relationship with the drug is probable with a score of 5.

Question: Given [Joint Damage and Neuropathic Pain in Rats Treated With Lysophosphatidic Acid. Joint pain is a complex phenomenon that involves multiple endogenous mediators and pathophysiological events. In addition to nociceptive and inflammatory pain, some patients report neuropathic-like pain symptoms. Examination of arthritic joints from humans and preclinical animal models have revealed axonal damage which is likely the source of the neuropathic pain. The mediators responsible for joint peripheral neuropathy are obscure, but lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) has emerged as a leading candidate target. In the present study, male and female Wistar rats received an intra-articular injection of LPA into the right knee and allowed to recover for 28 days. Joint pain was measured by von Frey hair algesiometry, while joint pathology was determined by scoring of histological sections. Both male and female rats showed comparable degenerative changes to the LPA-treated knee including chondrocyte death, focal bone erosion, and synovitis. Mechanical withdrawal thresholds decreased by 20-30% indicative of secondary allodynia in the affected limb; however, there was no significant difference in pain sensitivity between the sexes. Treatment of LPA animals with the neuropathic pain drug amitriptyline reduced joint pain for over 2 hours with no sex differences being observed. In summary, intra-articular injection of LPA causes joint degeneration and neuropathic pain thereby mimicking some of the characteristics of neuropathic osteoarthritis.] you can assume that [Lysophosphatidic acid can be used to treat neuropathic pain.].

Question: Given [Joint Damage and Neuropathic Pain in Rats Treated With Lysophosphatidic Acid. Joint pain is a complex phenomenon that involves multiple endogenous mediators and pathophysiological events. In addition to nociceptive and inflammatory pain, some patients report neuropathic-like pain symptoms. Examination of arthritic joints from humans and preclinical animal models have revealed axonal damage which is likely the source of the neuropathic pain. The mediators responsible for joint peripheral neuropathy are obscure, but lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) has emerged as a leading candidate target. In the present study, male and female Wistar rats received an intra-articular injection of LPA into the right knee and allowed to recover for 28 days. Joint pain was measured by von Frey hair algesiometry, while joint pathology was determined by scoring of histological sections. Both male and female rats showed comparable degenerative changes to the LPA-treated knee including chondrocyte death, focal bone erosion, and synovitis. Mechanical withdrawal thresholds decreased by 20-30% indicative of secondary allodynia in the affected limb; however, there was no significant difference in pain sensitivity between the sexes. Treatment of LPA animals with the neuropathic pain drug amitriptyline reduced joint pain for over 2 hours with no sex differences being observed. In summary, intra-articular injection of LPA causes joint degeneration and neuropathic pain thereby mimicking some of the characteristics of neuropathic osteoarthritis.] you can infer that [Lysophosphatidic acid can be used to treat neuropathic pain.].

Question: Given [Aplastic anemia secondary to tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapy in a patient with chronic myeloid leukemia. Introduction: Nilotinib, as the second generation of tyrosine kinase inhibitor, has significant efficacy in patients with chronic myeloid leukemia resistant or intolerant to Imatinib. Aplastic anemia induced by tyrosine kinase inhibitors is an uncommon complication. Case report: A 34-year-old female case with CML in the chronic phase was treated with Imatinib in first-line therapy. Nilotinib was switched because of failure to achieve complete cytogenetic response at 6 months following Imatinib. Three years with Nilotinib, the patient developed a persistent pancytopenia grade 4 while a major molecular response was achieved. Management & Outcome: Nilotinib was discontinued. However, the hematologic finding of the patient had not recovered after three months. A bone marrow biopsy showed marked hypocellularity and fatty tissue without evidence of myelofibrosis. Immunosuppressive therapy was started. Unfortunately, the patient died due to septic and hemorrhagic shock nine months after Nilotinib interruption. According to Naranjo's algorithm, the causality relationship with the drug is probable with a score of 5. Discussion: Aplastic anemia is an uncommon adverse event of tyrosine kinase inhibitors but it can be a fatal complication. The early diagnosis of aplastic anemia related to Nilotinib therapy is needed to avoid further detrimental effects of the drug.] you can imply that [Nilotinib can induce aplastic anemia in patients with chronic myeloid leukemia resistant or intolerant to imatinib.].

Question: Given [Gut microbiota-derived l-histidine/imidazole propionate axis fights against the radiation-induced cardiopulmonary injury. Radiation-induced cardiopulmonary injuries are the most common and intractable side effects that are entwined with radiotherapy for thorax cancers. However, the therapeutic options for such complications have yielded disappointing results in clinical applications. Here, we reported that gut microbiota-derived L-Histidine and its secondary metabolite imidazole propionate (ImP) fought against radiation-induced cardiopulmonary injury in an entiric flora-dependent manner in mouse models. Local chest irradiation decreased the level of L-Histidine in fecal pellets, which was increased following fecal microbiota transplantation. L-Histidine replenishment via an oral route retarded the pathological process of lung and heart tissues and improved lung respiratory and heart systolic function following radiation exposure. L-Histidine preserved the gut bacterial taxonomic proportions shifted by total chest irradiation but failed to perform radioprotection in gut microbiota-deleted mice. ImP, the downstream metabolite of L-Histidine, accumulated in peripheral blood and lung tissues following L-Histidine replenishment and protected against radiation-induced lung and heart toxicity. Orally gavaged ImP could not enter into the circulatory system in mice through an antibiotic cocktail treatment. Importantly, ImP inhibited pyroptosis to nudge lung cell proliferation after radiation challenge. Together, our findings pave a novel method of protection against cardiopulmonary complications intertwined with radiotherapy in pre-clinical settings and underpin the idea that gut microbiota-produced L-Histidine and ImP are promising radioprotective agents.] you can assume that [Gut microbiota-produced L-Histidine and ImP are promising radioprotective agents that could be used to prevent radiotherapy-related cardiopulmonary complications.].

Question: Given [ALCAM regulates multiple myeloma chemoresistant side population. Drug-resistance is a major problem preventing a cure in patients with multiple myeloma (MM). Previously, we demonstrated that activated-leukocyte-cell-adhesion-molecule (ALCAM) is a prognostic factor in MM and inhibits EGF/EGFR-initiated MM clonogenicity. In this study, we further showed that the ALCAM-EGF/EGFR axis regulated the MM side population (SP)-mediated drug-resistance. ALCAM-knockdown MM cells displayed an enhanced ratio of SP cells in the presence of bone marrow stromal cells (BMSCs) or with the supplement of recombinant EGF. SP MM cells were resistant to chemotherapeutics melphalan or bortezomib. Drug treatment stimulated SP-genesis. Mechanistically, EGFR, primed with EGF, activated the hedgehog pathway and promoted the SP ratio; meanwhile, ALCAM inhibited EGFR downstream pro-MM cell signaling. Further, SP MM cells exhibited an increased number of mitochondria compared to the main population. Interference of the mitochondria function strongly inhibited SP-genesis. Animal studies showed that combination therapy with both an anti-MM agent and EGFR inhibitor gefitinib achieved prolonged MM-bearing mice survival.

Question: Given [LEAP2 Impairs the Capability of the Growth Hormone Secretagogue Receptor to Regulate the Dopamine 2 Receptor Signaling. The growth hormone secretagogue receptor (GHSR) signals in response to ghrelin, but also acts via ligand-independent mechanisms that include either constitutive activation or interaction with other G protein-coupled receptors, such as the dopamine 2 receptor (D2R). A key target of GHSR in neurons is voltage-gated calcium channels type 2.2 (CaV2.2). Recently, the liver-expressed antimicrobial peptide 2 (LEAP2) was recognized as a novel GHSR ligand, but the mechanism of action of LEAP2 on GHSR is not well understood. Here, we investigated the role of LEAP2 on the canonical and non-canonical modes of action of GHSR on CaV2.2 function. Using a heterologous expression system and patch-clamp recordings, we found that LEAP2 impairs the reduction of CaV2.2 currents induced by ghrelin-evoked and constitutive GHSR activities, acting as a GHSR antagonist and inverse agonist, respectively. We also found that LEAP2 prevents GHSR from modulating the effects of D2R signaling on CaV2.2 currents, and that the GHSR-binding N-terminal region LEAP2 underlies these effects. Using purified labeled receptors assembled into lipid nanodiscs and Forster Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET) assessments, we found that the N-terminal region of LEAP2 stabilizes an inactive conformation of GHSR that is dissociated from Gq protein and, consequently, reverses the effect of GHSR on D2R-dependent Gi activation. Thus, our results provide critical molecular insights into the mechanism mediating LEAP2 modulation of GHSR.] you can assume that [The N-terminal region of LEAP2 binds the growth hormone secretagogue receptor and stabilizes its inactive conformation.].

Question: Given [Effect of perinatal vitamin d deficiency on lung mesenchymal stem cell differentiation and injury repair potential. Stem cells, including the resident lung mesenchymal stem cells (LMSCs), are critically important for injury repair. Compelling evidence links perinatal vitamin D (VD) deficiency to reactive airway disease; however, the effects of perinatal VD deficiency on LMSC function is unknown. We tested the hypothesis that perinatal VD deficiency alters LMSC proliferation, differentiation, and function, leading to an enhanced myogenic phenotype. We also determined whether LMSCs' effects on alveolar type II (ATII) cell function are paracrine. Using an established rat model of perinatal VD deficiency, we studied the effects of four dietary regimens (0, 250, 500, or 1,000 IU/kg cholecalciferol-supplemented groups). At Postnatal Day 21, LMSCs were isolated, and cell proliferation and differentiation (under basal and adipogenic induction conditions) were determined. LMSC paracrine effects on ATII cell proliferation and differentiation were determined by culturing ATII cells in LMSC-conditioned media from different experimental groups. Using flow cytometry, .95% of cells were CD45-ve, .90% were CD901ve, .58% were CD1051ve, and .64% were Stro-11ve, indicating their stem cell phenotype. Compared with the VD-supplemented groups, LMSCs from the VD-deficient group demonstrated suppressed PPARc, but enhanced Wnt signaling, under basal and adipogenic induction conditions. LMSCs from 250 VD- and 500 VD-supplemented groups effectively blocked the effects of perinatal VD deficiency. LMSC-conditioned media from the VD-deficient group inhibited ATII cell proliferation and differentiation compared with those from the 250 VD- and 500 VD-supplemented groups. These data support the concept that perinatal VD deficiency alters LMSC proliferation and differentiation, potentially contributing to increased respiratory morbidity seen in children born to mothers with VD deficiency.] you can assume that [perinatal vitamin D (VD) deficiency contributes to increased respiratory morbidity seen in children born to mothers with VD deficiency.].

Question: Given [Leveraging network using controlled weight learning approach for thyroid cancer lymph node detection. Identification of cervical metastatic lymph nodes (LN) on I-131 post-ablation whole-body planar scans (WBS) for cancer staging is crucial for patients with papillary thyroid cancer (PTC). The existing deep network is plagued by instability in finding the under-represented LN classes on highly complex WBS, where end-to-end tuned models that can account for this uncertainty region for multi-class locations are needed. Hence, as a key contribution of this study, we designed a novel leveraging segmentation network with input guidance (LSIG) end-to-end training model without pre and post-processing features that can learn ideal parameter settings depending on the quantity of multiple-object instances. To improve the co-occurrence of classes and control the false positive regions, we proposed a re-weighting negative control (RNC) mechanism that combines two key components, namely the re-weighting (Rw) term and the negative control function (NcF). This unified approximation of weighted training would leverage the network to control and learn the desired weights of true positives towards the LN region. As an end-to-end network training, we utilize a Unet-like convolution neural network (CNN) model. The performance of the LSIG is compared with the CNN-based networks, based on the ground truth (GT) mask developed using post-ablation single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT/CT). Furthermore, the effectiveness of the two components used in the LSIG framework is evaluated on WBS datasets.

Question: Given [Levodopa Challenge Test Predicts STN-DBS Outcomes in Various Parkinson's Disease Motor Subtypes: A More Accurate Judgment. Background. The relationship between the levodopa challenge test (LDCT) and postoperative subthalamic nucleus-deep brain stimulation (STN-DBS) benefits is controversial in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD). We aim to evaluate the value of total levodopa response (TLR) and symptom levodopa response (SLR) in predicting postoperative improvement in different PD motor subtypes. Methods. Studies were split into a training set (147 patients) and a validation set (304 patients). We retrospectively collected data from 147 patients who received the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale- (UPDRS-) III and the Parkinson's Disease Questionnaire- (PDQ-) 39 evaluation. Patients were classified into tremor-dominant (TD), akinetic-rigid-dominant (AR), and mixed (MX) groups. Clinically important difference (CID) was employed to dichotomize DBS effects. For patients in each subtype group from the training set, we used the correlation and receiver operator characteristic (ROC) curve analyses to explore the strength of their relations. Areas under the curve (AUCs) were calculated and compared through the DeLong test. Results developed from the training set were applied into the validation set to predict postoperative improvement in different PD motor subtypes. Results. In the validation cohort, TLR significantly correlated with postoperative motor (p<0.001) and quality of life (QOL) (p<0.001) improvement in the MX group. The AUC between TLR and UPDRS-III (TU) is 0.800. The AUC between TLR and PDQ-39 (TP) is 0.770. An associated criterion in both TU and TP is around 50%. In the AR group, strong correlation was only found in SLR and PDQ-39 (SP) (p<0.001). And the AUC of SP is significantly larger than that in TLR and PDQ-39 (TP) (p=0.034). An associated criterion in SP is around 37%. No significant correlation was found in the TD group. Conclusions. We provide a more accurate judgment for LDCT. TLR strongly correlated with postoperative UPDRS-III and PDQ-39 improvement in MX patients. A TLR>50% may indicate a higher possibility of clinically meaningful benefits from STN-DBS comparing to medication only. SLR can well predict QOL improvement in AR patients. Similarly, a SLR>37% may indicate a higher possibility of clinically significant benefits from STN-DBS. LDCT provides limited information for TD patients.

Secondary endpoints included the type, frequency, and severity of errors identified during second verification using a modified National Coordinating Council for Medication Error Reporting and Prevention Index. Results: A total of 1970 anti-cancer parenteral orders were screened, from which 1645 received an independent double check and were included. The number of errors identified during first and second verification were 30 (1.8%) and 10 (0.6%) respectively; second verification resulted in a 33.3% increase in corrected errors. The 10 errors identified during second verification included: four rate transcriptions to optimize pump interoperability, three rate and/or volume modifications, two dosage adjustments, and one treatment deferral due to toxicity. The severity was classified as Category A for four (40%), Category C for three (30%), and Category D for three (30%) errors.

Question: Given [Life-Threatening Docetaxel Toxicity in a Patient With Reduced-Function CYP3A Variants: A Case Report. Docetaxel therapy occasionally causes severe and life-threatening toxicities. Some docetaxel toxicities are related to exposure, and inter-individual variability in exposure has been described based on genetic variation and drug-drug interactions that impact docetaxel clearance. Cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4) and CYP3A5 metabolize docetaxel into inactive metabolites, and this is the primary mode of docetaxel clearance. Supporting their role in these toxicities, increased docetaxel toxicities have been found in patients with reduced- or loss-of-function variants in CYP3A4 and CYP3A5. However, since these variants in CYP3A4 are rare, little is known about the safety of docetaxel in patients who are homozygous for the reduced-function CYP3A4 variants. Here we present a case of life-threatening (grade 4) pneumonitis, dyspnea, and neutropenia resulting from a single dose of docetaxel. This patient was (1) homozygous for CYP3A4*22, which causes reduced expression and is associated with increased docetaxel-related adverse events, (2) heterozygous for CYP3A4*3, a rare reduced-function missense variant, and (3) homozygous for CYP3A5*3, a common loss of function splicing defect that has been associated with increased docetaxel exposure and adverse events. The patient also carried functional variants in other genes involved in docetaxel pharmacokinetics that may have increased his risk of toxicity. We identified one additional CYP3A4*22 homozygote that received docetaxel in our research cohort, and present this case of severe hematological toxicity. Furthermore, the one other CYP3A4*22 homozygous patient we identified from the literature died from docetaxel toxicity. This case report provides further evidence for the need to better understand the impact of germline CYP3A variants in severe docetaxel toxicity and supports using caution when treating patients with docetaxel who have genetic variants resulting in CYP3A poor metabolizer phenotypes.] you can assume that [The impact of germline CYP3A variants on severe docetaxel toxicity is well understood.].

The primary endpoint was error identification rates during first and second verification. Secondary endpoints included the type, frequency, and severity of errors identified during second verification using a modified National Coordinating Council for Medication Error Reporting and Prevention Index. Results: A total of 1970 anti-cancer parenteral orders were screened, from which 1645 received an independent double check and were included. The number of errors identified during first and second verification were 30 (1.8%) and 10 (0.6%) respectively; second verification resulted in a 33.3% increase in corrected errors. The 10 errors identified during second verification included: four rate transcriptions to optimize pump interoperability, three rate and/or volume modifications, two dosage adjustments, and one treatment deferral due to toxicity. The severity was classified as Category A for four (40%), Category C for three (30%), and Category D for three (30%) errors. This correlated to a low capacity for harm for seven (70%) and a serious capacity for three (30%) errors. Conclusions: Second verification of outpatient, parenteral anti-cancer medication orders resulted in a 33.3% increase in corrected errors. Three errors detected during second verification were determined to have a serious capacity for harm, supporting the value of independent double checks during pharmacist cognitive order verification.] you can imply that [Second verification of outpatient parenteral anti-cancer medication cognitive orders does not result in an increase in corrected errors.].

Question: Given [Life-Threatening Docetaxel Toxicity in a Patient With Reduced-Function CYP3A Variants: A Case Report. Docetaxel therapy occasionally causes severe and life-threatening toxicities. Some docetaxel toxicities are related to exposure, and inter-individual variability in exposure has been described based on genetic variation and drug-drug interactions that impact docetaxel clearance. Cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4) and CYP3A5 metabolize docetaxel into inactive metabolites, and this is the primary mode of docetaxel clearance. Supporting their role in these toxicities, increased docetaxel toxicities have been found in patients with reduced- or loss-of-function variants in CYP3A4 and CYP3A5. However, since these variants in CYP3A4 are rare, little is known about the safety of docetaxel in patients who are homozygous for the reduced-function CYP3A4 variants. Here we present a case of life-threatening (grade 4) pneumonitis, dyspnea, and neutropenia resulting from a single dose of docetaxel. This patient was (1) homozygous for CYP3A4*22, which causes reduced expression and is associated with increased docetaxel-related adverse events, (2) heterozygous for CYP3A4*3, a rare reduced-function missense variant, and (3) homozygous for CYP3A5*3, a common loss of function splicing defect that has been associated with increased docetaxel exposure and adverse events. The patient also carried functional variants in other genes involved in docetaxel pharmacokinetics that may have increased his risk of toxicity. We identified one additional CYP3A4*22 homozygote that received docetaxel in our research cohort, and present this case of severe hematological toxicity. Furthermore, the one other CYP3A4*22 homozygous patient we identified from the literature died from docetaxel toxicity. This case report provides further evidence for the need to better understand the impact of germline CYP3A variants in severe docetaxel toxicity and supports using caution when treating patients with docetaxel who have genetic variants resulting in CYP3A poor metabolizer phenotypes.] you can imply that [The impact of germline CYP3A variants on severe docetaxel toxicity is well understood.].

Question: Given [Non-immediate drug hypersensitivity reactions secondary to intravitreal anti-vascular endothelial growth factors. Purpose: To describe a series of non-immediate drug hypersensitivity reactions after intravitreal anti-vascular endothelial growth factors (anti-VEGFs). Patients and methods: Retrospective report of 6 patients with cutaneous non-immediate drug hypersensitivity reactions following intravitreal anti-VEGF injections, 4 after ranibizumab, 1 after bevacizumab and 1 after aflibercept. Results: Clinical manifestations ranged from mild maculopapular rash, purpura to severe generalized erythroderma, with or without systemic involvement such as microscopic hematuria and proteinuria or fever. In two out of the six patients, reintroduction of either the same or an alternative anti-VEGF drug did induce a recurrence of the drug hypersensitivity reaction, while 4 patients showed no recurrence. Conclusion: Cutaneous non-immediate drug hypersensitivity reactions secondary to intravitreal anti-VEGF may occur. Continuation of the same drug or switch to another anti-VEGF may either induce recurrence or be well supported by the patient.

Question: Given [Ligand-Induced Stabilization of the Native Human Superoxide Dismutase 1. A common characteristic of familial (fALS) and sporadic amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (sALS) is the accumulation of aberrant proteinaceous species in the motor neurons and spinal cord of ALS patients - including aggregates of the human superoxide dismutase 1 (hSOD1). hSOD1 is an enzyme that occurs as a stable dimeric protein with several post-translational modifications such as the formation of an intramolecular disulfide bond and the acquisition of metal cofactors that are essential for enzyme activity and further contribute to protein stability. Some mutations and/or destabilizing factors promote hSOD1 misfolding, causing neuronal death. Aggregates containing misfolded wild-type hSOD1 have been found in the spinal cords of sALS as well as in non-hSOD1 fALS patients, leading to the hypothesis that hSOD1 misfolding is a common part of the ALS pathomechanism. Therefore, stabilizing the native conformation of SOD1 may be a promising approach to prevent the formation of toxic hSOD1 species and thus ALS pathogenesis. Here, we present the 16-mer peptide S1VL-21 that interferes with hSOD1 aggregation. S1VL-21 was identified by phage display selection with the native conformation of hSOD1 as a target. Several methods such as microscale thermophoresis (MST) measurements, aggregation assays, and cell viability assays revealed that S1VL-21 has a micromolar binding affinity to native hSOD1 and considerably reduces the formation of hSOD1 aggregates. This present work therefore provides the first important data on a potential lead compound for hSOD1-related drug development for ALS therapy.

Importance: Suicide and suicide attempts are persistent and increasing public health problems. Observational studies and meta-analyses of randomized clinical trials have suggested that lithium may prevent suicide in patients with bipolar disorder or depression. Objective: To assess whether lithium augmentation of usual care reduces the rate of repeated episodes of suicide-related events (repeated suicide attempts, interrupted attempts, hospitalizations to prevent suicide, and deaths from suicide) in participants with bipolar disorder or depression who have survived a recent event. Design, Setting, and Participants: This double-blind, placebo-controlled randomized clinical trial assessed lithium vs placebo augmentation of usual care in veterans with bipolar disorder or depression who had survived a recent suicide-related event. Veterans at 29 VA medical centers who had an episode of suicidal behavior or an inpatient admission to prevent suicide within 6 months were screened between July 1, 2015, and March 31, 2019. Interventions: Participants were randomized to receive extended-release lithium carbonate beginning at 600 mg/d or placebo. Main Outcomes and Measures: Time to the first repeated suicide-related event, including suicide attempts, interrupted attempts, hospitalizations specifically to prevent suicide, and deaths from suicide. Results: The trial was stopped for futility after 519 veterans (mean [SD] age, 42.8 [12.4] years; 437 [84.2%] male) were randomized: 255 to lithium and 264 to placebo. Mean lithium concentrations at 3 months were 0.54 mEq/L for patients with bipolar disorder and 0.46 mEq/L for patients with major depressive disorder.

Question: Given [Secondary syphilis associated crescentic glomerulonephritis: A case report. Introduction: Syphilis is a sexually transmitted disease caused by the bacterium Treponema Pallidum and has a diverse clinical presentation, including nephropathies, the most common of which is membranous nephropathy. Crescentic glomerulonephritis is not typically considered to be a manifestation of Syphilis associated renal disease. Case presentation: Here we describe an unusual case of crescentic glomerulonephritis associated with secondary syphilis resulting in a rapidly progressing glomerulonephritis presentation requiring hemodialysis. The patient was treated with Penicillin G and intravenous solumedrol. The patient's kidney function recovered and several months after presentation the patient was asymptomatic off hemodialysis with a serum creatinine of 1.54 mg/dL. Discussion/conclusion: Secondary syphilis rarely presents with rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis. This report is only the third such case reported to date of a diffuse necrotizing/crescentic glomerulonephritis resulting from a syphilis infection. As syphilis is on the rise, this report highlights an important differential diagnostic consideration for any necrotizing/crescentic glomerulonephritis.] you can imply that [Crescentic glomerulonephritis could be a manifestation of syphilis-associated renal disease.].

Question: Given [Loncastuximab tesirine for treatment of relapsed or refractory diffuse large B cell lymphoma. Introduction: Approximately, a third of patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) have refractory or relapsed disease after initial treatment. Despite recent regulatory approval of several new agents, including CAR-T cell therapy, polatuzumab vedotin and tafasitamab, there is still a need for additional therapies that expand the therapeutic alternatives and improve outcomes for patients with DLBCL that progresses after first line therapy.

Aim: To investigate effectiveness and safety outcomes among patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D) initiating empagliflozin versus dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitor treatment across the broad spectrum of cardiovascular risk. Methods: In a population-based cohort study we identified 39 072 pairs of 1:1 propensity score-matched adult patients with T2D initiating empagliflozin or DPP-4 inhibitors, using data from 2 US commercial insurance databases and Medicare between August 2014 and September 2017. The primary outcomes were a composite of myocardial infarction (MI)/stroke, and hospitalization for heart failure (HHF). Safety outcomes were bone fractures, lower-limb amputations (LLAs), diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), and acute kidney injury (AKI). We estimated pooled hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) adjusting for more than 140 baseline covariates. Results: Study participants had a mean age of 60 years and only 28% had established cardiovascular disease. Compared to DPP-4 inhibitors, empagliflozin was associated with similar risk of MI/stroke (HR 0.99 [95% CI 0.81-1.21]), and lower risk of HHF (HR 0.48 [95% CI 0.35-0.67] and 0.63 [95% CI 0.54-0.74], based on a primary and any heart failure discharge diagnosis, respectively).

Question: Given [Long term outcome of functional hemispherectomy for refractory epilepsy: Experience from a single center. Background: Hemispherectomy has an established role as a treatment of last resort in patients with unilateral hemispheric lesions suffering from refractory epilepsy. Methods: Seven patients were evaluated at our Epilepsy Unit. We compared the seizure outcome at 6 months, 1, 2, 5 years post-surgery, as well as at end follow-up (mean 7.1 years) using Engel classification. Reduction of antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) was also assessed utilizing equal time frames. Results: The mean age of seizure onset was 5.4 years. Engel I was achieved in 5 patients at 6 months (71.4%). Engel at 1 year was predicted by the Engel at 6 months (p = 0.013) with a similar number of patients being classified as Engel I outcome. Engel at 2 years was also predicted by Engel at 6 months and at 1 year (p = 0.030). At end follow-up only 3 patients (42.9%) remained categorized as Engel I outcome. There was a trend toward a stability in Engel classification. All patients with developmental causes for their epilepsy experienced some deterioration of the surgical outcomes. Conversely, all patients with acquired causes were stable throughout follow-up. Seizure outcome at 6 months was worse in the patients who had post-op complications (p = 0.044). Adult and pediatric populations did not differ significantly in any tested variable. Conclusions: Hemispherectomy is a valuable resource for seizure control in properly selected patients.

Question: Given [Iduronate-2-sulfatase transport vehicle rescues behavioral and skeletal phenotypes in a mouse model of Hunter syndrome. Mucopolysaccharidosis type II (MPS II) is a lysosomal storage disorder caused by deficiency of the iduronate-2-sulfatase (IDS) enzyme, resulting in cellular accumulation of glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) throughout the body. Treatment of MPS II remains a considerable challenge as current enzyme replacement therapies do not adequately control many aspects of the disease, including skeletal and neurological manifestations. We developed an IDS transport vehicle (ETV:IDS) that is engineered to bind to the transferrin receptor; this design facilitates receptor-mediated transcytosis of IDS across the blood-brain barrier and improves its distribution into the brain while maintaining distribution to peripheral tissues. Here we show that chronic systemic administration of ETV:IDS in a mouse model of MPS II reduced levels of peripheral and central nervous system GAGs, microgliosis, and neurofilament light chain, a biomarker of neuronal injury. Additionally, ETV:IDS rescued auricular and skeletal abnormalities when introduced in adult MPS II mice. These effects were accompanied by improvements in several neurobehavioral domains, including motor skills, sensorimotor gating, and learning and memory. Together, these results highlight the therapeutic potential of ETV:IDS for treating peripheral and central abnormalities in MPS II.

Question: Given [Long-term Follow-up of Psychiatric Disorders in Children and Adolescents Conceived by Assisted Reproductive Techniques in Sweden. Importance: Individuals conceived with assisted reproductive techniques (ARTs) could be at elevated risk of psychiatric disorders owing to potential adverse effects of the procedures themselves, or because such traits or their risk factors may be more common in couples with infertility. Objective: To investigate the risk of psychiatric disorders in adolescents and young adults conceived with ARTs and to evaluate the role of treatment-related parental characteristics. Design, Setting, and Participants: This prospective follow-up of a nationwide birth cohort used linkage of Swedish population registers with coverage through 2018. All children born in Sweden from January 1, 1994, to December 31, 2006, were included in the analysis. Follow-up was completed on December 31, 2018, when participants were 12 to 25 years of age, and data was analyzed from March 17, 2020, to September 10, 2021. Exposures: In vitro fertilization with or without intracytoplasmic sperm injection and transfer of fresh or frozen-thawed embryos. Main Outcomes and Measures: Clinical diagnoses of mood disorder, including major depression, anxiety, obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), or suicidal behavior, were identified from hospital records and outpatient specialist care. Suicide was additionally identified from death certificates. Antidepressant use was identified from dispensations of prescribed medications. Results: A total of 1221812 children (48.6% female, 51.4% male) born between 1994 and 2006 were followed up to a median age of 18 (IQR, 15-21) years. Among these participants, 31565 (2.6%) were conceived with ART. Compared with all others, adolescents conceived with ART had an elevated risk of OCD (hazard ratio [HR], 1.35 [95% CI, 1.20-1.51]), but the association was attenuated and no longer statistically significant after adjustment for parental characteristics (adjusted HR [aHR], 1.10 [95% CI, 0.98-1.24]) and was no longer present when restricted to individuals born to couples with known infertility (aHR, 1.02 [95% CI, 0.89-1.17]). Adolescents conceived with ARTs were not at elevated risk of depression or suicidal behavior compared with other adolescents (irrespective of parental infertility). Type of fertilization (standard in vitro fertilization or intracytoplasmic sperm injection) had no association with outcomes. Compared with non-ART-conceived children of couples with infertility, fresh, but not frozen, embryo transfer was associated with a lower risk of mood disorders (aHR, 0.90 [95% CI, 0.83-0.97]), making frozen embryo transfer appear less advantageous when directly contrasted with fresh embryo transfer. Conclusions and Relevance: These findings suggest that adolescents conceived with ARTs around the millennium are not at risk of poor psychiatric health compared with the general population, except for an elevated risk of OCD that may be explained by differences in parental characteristics..] you can assume that [Compared with non-ART-conceived children of couples with infertility, frozen embryo transfer was associated with a lower risk of mood disorders.].

We present the case of a young woman with fully reversible radiculomyelitis, which happened after the first dose of the ChAdOx1 nCOVID-19 vaccine. A previously healthy woman in her 20s presented with a subacute onset of legs' weakness and sensory disturbances, urinary dysfunction and cramping pain after receiving the first dose of the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine. A diagnostic workup led to the diagnosis of inflammatory radiculomyelitis. Her clinical status improved, with complete recovery after a few months. The case described a reversible radiculomyelitis associated with the ChAdOx1 nCOVID-19 vaccine. The clinical picture and evolution supported the diagnosis. No other identifiable causes of myelopathy were found. Our patient showed clinically moderate symptoms and signs, showing good recovery. The post-vaccine inflammatory radiculomyelitis is a rare side effect of the anti-COVID-19 vaccination, and it should not discourage the SARS-CoV-2 vaccination programme.

Question: Given [Long-term efficacy and safety of CT-P10 or rituximab in untreated advanced follicular lymphoma: A randomized phase 3 study. Rituximab biosimilars are a cornerstone of treatment of advanced-stage follicular lymphoma (FL). This double-blind, parallel-group, phase 3 trial randomized (1:1) adults ($18 years) with stage III to IV indolent B-cell lymphoma, including grades 1 to 3a FL, to receive CT-P10 or rituximab (375 mg/m2 IV), with cyclophosphamide, vincristine, and prednisone, every 3 weeks for 8 cycles (induction period). Patients achieving complete response (CR), unconfirmed CR, or partial response (PR) received CT-P10 or rituximab maintenance for 2 years (375 mg/m2, every 8 weeks). Primary end points were previously reported, proving noninferiority of efficacy and pharmacokinetic equivalence of CT-P10 to rituximab. Secondary end points included overall response rate (PR1CR) during the induction period per 2007 International Working Group (IWG) criteria, survival analyses, and overall safety. Between 28 July 2014 and 29 December 2015, 140 patients were randomized (70 per group). Median follow-up was 39.9 months (interquartile range, 36.7-43.5). Per 1999 IWG criteria, 4-year Kaplan-Meier estimates (95% confidence interval [CI]) for CT-P10 and rituximab were 61% (47% to 73%) and 55% (36% to 70%) for progression-free survival (hazard ratio, 1.33 [95% CI, 0.67-2.63]; P5.409), respectively, and 88% (77% to 94%) and 93% (83% to 97%) for overall survival (5.29 [0.84-33.53]; P5.077).

Question: Given [Silybin Alleviates Experimental Autoimmune Encephalomyelitis by Suppressing Dendritic Cell Activation and Th17 Cell Differentiation. Silybin, a peculiar flavonoid compound derived from the fruit and seeds of Silybum marianum, exhibits strong anti-inflammatory activities. In the present study, we found that silybin effectively alleviated experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), an animal model of multiple sclerosis (MS), via inhibition of dendritic cell (DC) activation and Th17 cell differentiation. Silybin treatment greatly ameliorated the disease severity and significantly declined inflammation and demyelination of the central nervous system (CNS) of EAE mice. Consistent with the disease development, silybin-treated bone marrow-derived DCs (BM-DCs) exhibited reduced costimulatory molecules (e.g., CD80 and CD86) and MHC II expression. These results demonstrated the distinguished bioactivity of silybin for suppressing DC activation, inhibiting pathogenic Th17 inflammatory cell responses, and, eventually, alleviating EAE severity.

Question: Given [Longitudinal change of genetic variations in cetuximab-treated metastatic colorectal cancer.

Moreover, we identified the emergent gene mutations (CDK6, EPHA3, ERCC2, MYC, PCMTD1, PIK3CA, PRIM2, RICTOR, and ZNRF3) and copy number alterations (ARAF, BCL2, BRCA2, EGFR, MYC, and SMAD4) that were recurrently observed only in postprogression samples and not in pretreatment or posttreatment samples from patients revealing clinical response. Furthermore, to identify the feasible candidate variations implicated in treatment resistance, we examined the variants with clonal expansion during treatment and discovered PCBP1 as a variant associated with posttreatment progression. Various recurrent mutations were enriched in the TGF-beta signaling pathway. Collectively, we identified recurrent variations in mCRC samples exhibiting post-cetuximab progression.

Question: Given [CD36 is Associated With the Development of Coronary Artery Lesions in Patients With Kawasaki Disease. Kawasaki disease (KD) is an autoimmune-like vasculitis of childhood involving the coronary arteries. Macrophages require scavenger receptors such as CD36 to effectively clear cellular debris and induce self-tolerance. In this study, we hypothesized that CD36 plays an important role in the immunopathogenesis of KD, by aiding in the clearance of plasma mitochondrial DNA, and by amplifying the immune response by activating the inflammasome pathway via AIM2. Fifty-two healthy controls, 52 febrile controls, and 102 KD patients were recruited for RT-PCR of target mRNA expression and plasma mitochondrial DNA. Blood samples were obtained 24 hours prior and 21 days after the administration of intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) therapy. Patients with acute KD had higher plasma levels of cell-free mitochondrial DNA (ND1, ND4, and COX1), and higher mRNA expressions of CD36 and AIM2 when compared to both healthy and febrile controls. A greater decrease in both CD36 and AIM2 mRNA expression after IVIG therapy was associated with the development of coronary artery lesions. Coronary artery lesions were associated with a larger decrease of CD36 expression following IVIG therapy, which may indicate that prolonged expression of the scavenger receptor may have a protective effect against the development of coronary artery lesions in KD.] you can assume that [CD36 plays an important role in the development of coronary artery lesions in patients with Kawasaki disease.].

BACKGROUND: The intensity of the thromboprophylaxis needed as a potential factor for preventing inpatient mortality due to coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) remains unclear. OBJECTIVE: To explore the association between anticoagulation intensity and COVID-19 survival. DESIGN AND SETTING: Retrospective observational study in a tertiary-level hospital in Spain. METHODS: Low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) status was ascertained based on prescription at admission. To control for immortal time bias, anticoagulant use was analyzed as a time-dependent variable. RESULTS: 690 patients were included (median age, 72 years). LMWH was administered to 615 patients, starting from hospital admission (89.1%). 410 (66.7%) received prophylactic-dose LMWH; 120 (19.5%), therapeutic-dose LMWH; and another 85 (13.8%) who presented respiratory failure, high D-dimer levels (> 3 mg/l) and non-worsening of inflammation markers received prophylaxis of intermediate-dose LMWH.

Question: Given [Exosome-mediated miR-7-5p delivery enhances the anticancer effect of Everolimus via blocking MNK/eIF4E axis in non-small cell lung cancer. Everolimus is a kind of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitors. Activated mitogen-activated protein kinase interacting kinases/eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E (MNK/eIF4E) axis plays a crucial role in resistance to Everolimus in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The eIF4E phosphorylation increased by mTOR inhibitors is mainly mediated by MNKs. However, the mechanisms are poorly understood. Recently, extensive reprogramming of miRNA profiles has also been found after long-term mTOR inhibitor exposure. Our previous studies have confirmed that tumor suppressor miR-7-5p is decreased in A549 cells after treatment with Everolimus. Exactly, MNK1 is the target of miR-7-5p. In this study, we investigated the biological functions and potential molecular mechanisms of miR-7-5p in the NSCLC undergoing treatment with Everolimus. We confirmed that Everolimus targeted mTORC1 inducing NSCLC cells to secrete miR-7-5p-loaded exosomes in Rab27A and Rab27B-dependent manners. Loss of intracellular miR-7-5p induced phosphorylation of MNK/eIF4E axis, but a supplement of extra exosomal miR-7-5p could reverse it. Of note, both low expression of miR-7-5p and elevated MNK1 protein were associated with a poor prognosis of NSCLC. Both endogenous miR-7-5p and exo-miR-7-5p enhanced the therapeutic efficacy of Everolimus by inhibiting the proliferation, migration, and metastasis of NSCLC in vitro and in vivo. The combination of miR-7-5p with Everolimus induced apoptosis to exhibit a synergistic anticancer therapeutic efficacy through dual abrogation of MNK/eIF4E and mTOR in NSCLC. In conclusion, Everolimus decreases the intracellular miR-7-5p by releasing of miR-7-5p loaded exosomes from NSCLC cells in Rab27A and Rab27B dependent manners. Either endogenous miR-7-5p or exo-miR-7-5p combined with Everolimus can enhance the anticancer efficacy by targeting MNK/eIF4E axis and mTOR. Besides, both low levels of miR-7-5p and positive expression of MNK1 act as independent poor prognostic biomarkers for NSCLC. Therefore, restoring miR-7-5p carried by exosome may be a promising novel combined therapeutic strategy with Everolimus for NSCLC.] you can assume that [miR-7-5p blocks MNK/eIF4E axis in non-small cell lung cancer cells.].

Question: Given [Lower background infusion of oxycodone for patient-controlled intravenous analgesia, combined with ropivacaine intercostal nerve block, in patients undergoing thoracoscopic lobectomy for lung cancer: A randomized, double-blind, controlled clinical trial. Purpose: To compare the efficacy of a lower dose background infusion of oxycodone for patient-controlled intravenous analgesia (PCIA) with the conventional dose, following intercostal nerve block, for the management of postoperative pain in patients undergoing thoracoscopic lobectomy for lung cancer. Patients and Methods: This was a prospective, single-center, randomized, parallelgroup, double-blind, controlled clinical trial. In total, 155 patients scheduled for elective radical lobectomy via video-assisted thoracoscopy were recruited from December 2018 to July 2019, of whom 140 were ultimately included in the study population. Patients were randomized to receive either oxycodone 0.25 mg/h (low-dose group, n=70) or oxycodone 0.5 mg/h (control group, n=70) as a background infusion for PCIA, following ropivacaine intercostal nerve block, for postoperative pain management. The primary endpoints were rest and dynamic visual analogue scale (VAS) scores within 72 h of the operation. The secondary endpoints were patient satisfaction scores, consumption of postoperative analgesics, times of patient-controlled analgesia (PCA), and adverse events. Results: All 140 enrolled patients completed the study requirements and were included in the final analysis. The rest and dynamic VAS scores at 4 h, 24 h, 48 h, and 72 h postoperative were comparable between the low-dose group and the control group (P>0.05). However, the low-dose group had statistically significantly higher patient satisfaction scores (P<0.001) and lower postoperative analgesic consumption (P<0.001) as well as lower incidence of nausea and vomiting (P<0.05). The times of PCA was not statistically significantly different between the two groups, and no serious adverse events occurred in either group (P>0.05). Conclusion: A low-dose background infusion of oxycodone for postoperative PCIA can achieve a comparable analgesic effect to the conventional dose after thoracoscopic lobectomy for lung cancer. Furthermore, the low-dose regimen was associated with reduced consumption of oxycodone and increased patient satisfaction.] you can assume that [A low-dose background infusion of oxycodone for postoperative patient-controlled intravenous analgesia after thoracoscopic lobectomy for lung cancer can reduce oxycodone consumption with comparable analgesic effects to the conventional dose.].

Hence, as a key contribution of this study, we designed a novel leveraging segmentation network with input guidance (LSIG) end-to-end training model without pre and post-processing features that can learn ideal parameter settings depending on the quantity of multiple-object instances. To improve the co-occurrence of classes and control the false positive regions, we proposed a re-weighting negative control (RNC) mechanism that combines two key components, namely the re-weighting (Rw) term and the negative control function (NcF). This unified approximation of weighted training would leverage the network to control and learn the desired weights of true positives towards the LN region. As an end-to-end network training, we utilize a Unet-like convolution neural network (CNN) model. The performance of the LSIG is compared with the CNN-based networks, based on the ground truth (GT) mask developed using post-ablation single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT/CT). Furthermore, the effectiveness of the two components used in the LSIG framework is evaluated on WBS datasets. Our proposed LSIG with a fully guided (Fg) LS-FgCNN model yielded a superior performance with high AUC value of 94.9%, which is 14.6% higher than the previous network for PTC.] you can imply that [A novel leveraging segmentation network with input guidance (LSIG) training model improves thyroid cancer lymph node detection by single-photon emission computed tomography.].

Question: Given [Apremilast Prolongs the Time to First Biologic Therapy in Japanese Patients with Psoriasis. Introduction: Biologic agents are used in patients with severe psoriasis who have not adequately responded to existing conventional systemic therapies. However, only a limited number of medical institutions in Japan are approved to use them, and their relatively high cost represents a substantial burden to patients. Apremilast is an oral phosphodiesterase-4 inhibitor approved in Japan for the treatment of psoriasis vulgaris in adult patients with an inadequate response to topical therapies and psoriatic arthritis in adult patients with active disease. To date, a large-scale real-world study of treatment patterns and costs associated with apremilast in Japan has not been conducted. The objective of this study was to assess whether apremilast can prolong time to first biologic therapy use and decrease total medical cost. Methods: Using the Medical Data Vision hospital-based claims database, 506 psoriasis patients were propensity score matched and analyzed (apremilast: n = 253; non-apremilast: n = 253). Results: The incidence rate of first biologic therapy use per 1000 patient-years was significantly lower in the apremilast group than in the non-apremilast group (30.3 vs. 107.6; P < 0.001), and the total medical costs per month were significantly lower in the apremilast group than in the non-apremilast group (76,594 yen/month vs. 102,411 yen/month, P < 0.001). In a sensitivity analysis of a propensity-score-matched subset of eligible patients prescribed biologics during the follow-up period (apremilast: n = 14; non-apremilast: n = 14), the incidence of first biologic therapy use was 2,797.6 per 1000 patient-years (95% CI: 1,656.9, 4,723.6) in the non-apremilast group and 856.1 per 1000 patient-years (95% CI: 507.0, 1,445.5) in the apremilast group. Conclusion: These results suggest that apremilast prolongs the time to first biologic therapy use in patients with psoriasis, thereby reducing the total medical cost and decreasing the economic burden on patients.] you can assume that [Apremilast can reduce total medical costs per month compared to the non-apremilast group in Japanese patients with psoriasis.].

Identification of primary tumors and metastasis sites is an essential step in cancer diagnostics and the following treatment. Positron emission tomography-computed tomography (PET/CT) is one of the most reliable methods for scanning the whole organism for malignancies. In this work, we synthesized an 11C-labeled oligonucleotide primer and hybridized it to an anti-cancer DNA aptamer. The 11C-aptamer was applied for in vivo imaging of Ehrlich ascites carcinoma and its metastases in mice using PET/CT. The imaging experiments with the 11C-aptamer determined very small primary and secondary tumors of 3 mm2 and less. We also compared 11C imaging with the standard radiotracer, 2-deoxy-2-[fluorine-18]fluoro-D-glucose (18F-FDG), and found better selectivity of the 11C-aptamer to metastatic lesions in the metabolically active organs than 18F-FDG. 11C radionuclide with an ultra-short (20.38 min) half-life is considered safest for PET/CT imaging and does not cause false-positive results in heart imaging.

Question: Given [Meropenem Target Attainment and Population Pharmacokinetics in Critically Ill Septic Patients with Preserved or Increased Renal Function. Purpose: Critically ill patients with preserved or increased renal function have been shown to be at risk of underexposure to meropenem. Although many meropenem population pharmacokinetic (PK) models have been published, there is no large prospective population PK study with rich sampling focusing on patients most at risk of suboptimal pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) target attainment. Therefore, the aim of the present study was to evaluate PK/PD target attainment and to perform a thorough covariate screening using population PK modelling of meropenem in septic patients with preserved or increased renal function. Patients and Methods: A single-centre prospective observational PK study was performed in the intensive care unit (ICU) of the University Hospitals Leuven. Patients with severe sepsis or septic shock and treated with meropenem in the ICU were screened for inclusion. Patients were excluded if they received renal replacement therapy or had an estimated glomerular filtration rate according to the Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology collaboration equation <70 mL/min/1.73m2 on the day of PK sampling. Successful PK/PD target attainment was defined as an unbound meropenem trough concentration above 2 mg/L or 8 mg/L. Population PK modelling was performed with NONMEM7.4. Results: In total, 58 patients were included, contributing 345 plasma samples over 70 dosing intervals. The 2 mg/L and 8 mg/L targets were successfully attained in 46% and 11% of all dosing intervals, respectively.

Question: Given [SARS-CoV-2 in Zimbabwe: Milestones and challenges faced towards achieving the expected 60% herd immunity. In response to COVID-19 pandemic, the Zimbabwe government put in place various rigorous measures to curb the spread of the virus. Although roll-out and access to COVID-19 vaccines in Africa have been slow, the World Health Organization (WHO)-led COVID-19 Vaccines Global Access (COVAX) consortium and the African vaccine acquisition task team are striving to provide 720 million doses of COVID-19 vaccines to achieve 60% coverage in Africa by June, 2022. In line with this, the Zimbabwe vaccination programme commenced on the 26th February 2021 and as of 9th June 2021, approximately, 2.6% of the population have been fully vaccinated in the country. Although the COVID-19 pandemic has crippled the economy and caused significant strain on the public health system, much has been done in the country since the first case was recorded (20th March 2020).

Question: Given [Meropenem Target Attainment and Population Pharmacokinetics in Critically Ill Septic Patients with Preserved or Increased Renal Function. Purpose: Critically ill patients with preserved or increased renal function have been shown to be at risk of underexposure to meropenem. Although many meropenem population pharmacokinetic (PK) models have been published, there is no large prospective population PK study with rich sampling focusing on patients most at risk of suboptimal pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) target attainment. Therefore, the aim of the present study was to evaluate PK/PD target attainment and to perform a thorough covariate screening using population PK modelling of meropenem in septic patients with preserved or increased renal function. Patients and Methods: A single-centre prospective observational PK study was performed in the intensive care unit (ICU) of the University Hospitals Leuven. Patients with severe sepsis or septic shock and treated with meropenem in the ICU were screened for inclusion. Patients were excluded if they received renal replacement therapy or had an estimated glomerular filtration rate according to the Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology collaboration equation <70 mL/min/1.73m2 on the day of PK sampling. Successful PK/PD target attainment was defined as an unbound meropenem trough concentration above 2 mg/L or 8 mg/L. Population PK modelling was performed with NONMEM7.4. Results: In total, 58 patients were included, contributing 345 plasma samples over 70 dosing intervals. The 2 mg/L and 8 mg/L targets were successfully attained in 46% and 11% of all dosing intervals, respectively.

Question: Given [Combined ASBT Inhibitor and FGF15 Treatment Improves Therapeutic Efficacy in Experimental Nonalcoholic Steatohepatitis. Background & Aims: Pharmacologic agents targeting bile acid signaling show promise for treating nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). However, clinical findings suggest that new treatment strategies with enhanced therapeutic efficacy and minimized undesired effects are needed. This preclinical study investigates whether combining an apical sodium-bile acid transporter (ASBT) inhibitor GSK233072 (GSK672) and fibroblast growth factor-15 (FGF15) signaling activation improves anti-NASH efficacy. Methods: Mice with high fat, cholesterol, and fructose (HFCFr) diet-induced NASH and stage 2 fibrosis are used as a NASH model. GSK672 or AAV8-TBG-FGF15 interventions are administered alone or in combination to HFCFr diet-fed mice. Results: The combined treatment significantly enhances therapeutic efficacy against steatosis, inflammation, ballooning, and fibrosis than either single treatment. Mechanistically, the synergistic actions of GSK672 and FGF15 on inhibiting gut bile acid reuptake and hepatic bile acid synthesis achieve greater magnitude of bile acid pool reduction that not only decreases bile acid burden in NASH livers but also limits intestinal lipid absorption, which, together with FGF15 signaling activation, produces weight loss, reduction of adipose inflammation, and attenuated hepatocellular organelle stress. Furthermore, the combined treatment attenuates increased fecal bile acid excretion and repressed bile acid synthesis, which underlie diarrhea and hypercholesterolemia associated with ASBT inhibition and FGF19 analogue, respectively, in clinical settings. Conclusions: Concomitant ASBT inhibition and FGF15 signaling activation produce metabolic changes that partially mimic the bariatric surgery condition whereby lipid malabsorption and increased FGF15/19 signaling synergistically mediate weight loss and metabolic improvement.

Question: Given [Gut microbiota-derived l-histidine/imidazole propionate axis fights against the radiation-induced cardiopulmonary injury. Radiation-induced cardiopulmonary injuries are the most common and intractable side effects that are entwined with radiotherapy for thorax cancers. However, the therapeutic options for such complications have yielded disappointing results in clinical applications. Here, we reported that gut microbiota-derived L-Histidine and its secondary metabolite imidazole propionate (ImP) fought against radiation-induced cardiopulmonary injury in an entiric flora-dependent manner in mouse models. Local chest irradiation decreased the level of L-Histidine in fecal pellets, which was increased following fecal microbiota transplantation. L-Histidine replenishment via an oral route retarded the pathological process of lung and heart tissues and improved lung respiratory and heart systolic function following radiation exposure. L-Histidine preserved the gut bacterial taxonomic proportions shifted by total chest irradiation but failed to perform radioprotection in gut microbiota-deleted mice. ImP, the downstream metabolite of L-Histidine, accumulated in peripheral blood and lung tissues following L-Histidine replenishment and protected against radiation-induced lung and heart toxicity. Orally gavaged ImP could not enter into the circulatory system in mice through an antibiotic cocktail treatment. Importantly, ImP inhibited pyroptosis to nudge lung cell proliferation after radiation challenge. Together, our findings pave a novel method of protection against cardiopulmonary complications intertwined with radiotherapy in pre-clinical settings and underpin the idea that gut microbiota-produced L-Histidine and ImP are promising radioprotective agents.] you can assume that [Gut microbiota-produced L-Histidine and ImP are promising radioprotective agents that could be used to prevent radiotherapy-related cardiopulmonary complications.].

The underlying mechanisms of differing aging rates across body masses are unclear, but it is generally agreed that metabolism is a significant regulator of the aging process. Herein, we performed a targeted metabolomics analysis on primary fibroblasts isolated from small and large breed young and old dogs. Regardless of size, older dogs exhibited lower glutathione and ATP, consistent with a role for oxidative stress and bioenergetic decline in aging. Furthermore, several size-specific metabolic patterns were observed with aging, including the following: (i) An apparent defect in the lower half of glycolysis in large old dogs at the level of pyruvate kinase. (ii) Increased glutamine anaplerosis into the TCA cycle in large old dogs. (iii) A potential defect in coenzyme A biosynthesis in large old dogs. (iv) Low nucleotide levels in small young dogs that corrected with age. (v) An age-dependent increase in carnitine in small dogs that was absent in large dogs.

Question: Given [Metformin Associated Lactic Acidosis in Clinical Practice - A Case Series. Aims The aim of this case report is to specify the frequency and mortality of Metformin-Associated Lactic Acidosis (MALA) in emergency medicine, as the diagnosis seems to occur more often than estimated. Methods To identify the subjects, we developed screening criteria for MALA. We measured the serum metformin concentration to confirm the diagnosis in all patients fulfilling these criteria. Retrospectively the patients were grouped according to individual risk (according to a defined risk score) and the application of renal replacement therapy. Results From 2013 until 2018 we were able to identify 11 MALA patients revealing a frequency of 1:4,000 emergency patients. Six patients survived and five died in the follow-up. All three patients in the high-risk group died although all of them received renal replacement therapy. In the low-risk group (three patients, one with renal replacement therapy), all patients survived, while in the intermediate-risk group (five patients, one with renal replacement therapy) three patients survived and two died. Additional severe comorbidities also contributed to mortality. Conclusions Every patient matching the screening criteria of acute renal failure, lactic acidosis and continued intake of metformin can be considered a potential MALA case. A risk score assessment which includes severe comorbidities may help to identify high-risk individuals and should be evaluated in larger studies.To prevent MALA, patients should be trained to immediately interrupt their own metformin use when showing signs of volume depletion. Physicians should be aware of the additional risk factors such as co-medication with diuretics, ACE (angiotensin converting enzyme) ACE inhibitors and NSAIDs (non steroidal anti inflammatory drugs).] you can assume that [Co-medication with diuretics, ACE inhibitors, and NSAIDs can increase the risk of metformin-associated lactic acidosis.].

Question: Given [Metformin Associated Lactic Acidosis in Clinical Practice - A Case Series. Aims The aim of this case report is to specify the frequency and mortality of Metformin-Associated Lactic Acidosis (MALA) in emergency medicine, as the diagnosis seems to occur more often than estimated. Methods To identify the subjects, we developed screening criteria for MALA. We measured the serum metformin concentration to confirm the diagnosis in all patients fulfilling these criteria. Retrospectively the patients were grouped according to individual risk (according to a defined risk score) and the application of renal replacement therapy. Results From 2013 until 2018 we were able to identify 11 MALA patients revealing a frequency of 1:4,000 emergency patients. Six patients survived and five died in the follow-up. All three patients in the high-risk group died although all of them received renal replacement therapy. In the low-risk group (three patients, one with renal replacement therapy), all patients survived, while in the intermediate-risk group (five patients, one with renal replacement therapy) three patients survived and two died. Additional severe comorbidities also contributed to mortality. Conclusions Every patient matching the screening criteria of acute renal failure, lactic acidosis and continued intake of metformin can be considered a potential MALA case. A risk score assessment which includes severe comorbidities may help to identify high-risk individuals and should be evaluated in larger studies.To prevent MALA, patients should be trained to immediately interrupt their own metformin use when showing signs of volume depletion. Physicians should be aware of the additional risk factors such as co-medication with diuretics, ACE (angiotensin converting enzyme) ACE inhibitors and NSAIDs (non steroidal anti inflammatory drugs).] you can infer that [Co-medication with diuretics, ACE inhibitors, and NSAIDs can increase the risk of metformin-associated lactic acidosis.].

Question: Given [Case Report: Sarcoid-Like Reactions and Tertiary Lymphoid Structures Following Dual Checkpoint Inhibition in a Patient with Early-Stage Lung Adenocarcinoma. Immune checkpoint inhibitor-induced sarcoid-like reactions and tertiary lymphoid structures (TLSs) are increasingly recognized but rarely reported in the same patient. We report a patient with lung adenocarcinoma who displayed sarcoid-like reactions in intrathoracic lymph nodes and tertiary lymphoid structures in surgical tumor after neoadjuvant therapy with nivolumab plus ipilimumab. Pathological examination revealed 50% residual tumor cells after treatment, and the CT evaluation of the primary tumor showed a stable disease. The patient experienced a recurrence eight months after surgery. To identify immune correlates of the limited response to immunotherapy, we conducted genomic and transcriptional assays, multiplex immunoassay, and multiplex immunohistochemistry on the pre- and post-immunotherapy tumor, lymph node, and plasma samples. TP53 R181C, KRAS G12C and SMAD4 R361H were identified as driver mutations of the tumor. In addition to abundant infiltrated lymphocytes, immunotherapy induced high levels of inhibitory components in post-treatment tissue samples, especially the FOXP3+ regulatory T cells in tumor and PD-L1 expression in the lymph node. Despite abundant TLSs in the post-treatment tumor, most TLSs were immature.

Question: Given [Description of the role of pharmacist independent double checks during cognitive order verification of outpatient parenteral anti-cancer therapy. Introduction: To describe pharmacist interventions as a result of an independent double check during cognitive order verification of outpatient parenteral anti-cancer therapy. Methods: A single-center, retrospective analysis of all individual orders for outpatient, parenteral anti-cancer agents within a hematology/oncology infusion center during a 30 day period was conducted. The primary endpoint was error identification rates during first and second verification. Secondary endpoints included the type, frequency, and severity of errors identified during second verification using a modified National Coordinating Council for Medication Error Reporting and Prevention Index. Results: A total of 1970 anti-cancer parenteral orders were screened, from which 1645 received an independent double check and were included. The number of errors identified during first and second verification were 30 (1.8%) and 10 (0.6%) respectively; second verification resulted in a 33.3% increase in corrected errors. The 10 errors identified during second verification included: four rate transcriptions to optimize pump interoperability, three rate and/or volume modifications, two dosage adjustments, and one treatment deferral due to toxicity. The severity was classified as Category A for four (40%), Category C for three (30%), and Category D for three (30%) errors. This correlated to a low capacity for harm for seven (70%) and a serious capacity for three (30%) errors.

These associations were stronger in models using metrics adjusted for the pre-vaccination baseline period.

Design: Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial. (ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT01456481) Setting: 25 university hospitals in Canada, the United States, Mexico, and the United Kingdom. Patients: Patients with recurrent vasovagal syncope and no serious comorbid conditions. Intervention: Patients were randomly assigned 1:1 to placebo or midodrine and followed for 12 months. Measurements: The primary outcome measure was the proportion of patients with at least 1 syncope episode during follow-up. Results: The study included 133 patients who had had a median of 6 syncope episodes in the prior year (median age, 32 years; 73% female). Compared with patients receiving placebo, fewer patients receiving midodrine had at least 1 syncope episode (28 of 66 [42%] vs. 41 of 67 [61%]). The relative risk was 0.69 (95% CI, 0.49 to 0.97; P = 0.035). The absolute risk reduction was 19 percentage points (CI, 2 to 36 percentage points), and the number needed to treat to prevent 1 patient from having syncope was 5.3 (CI, 2.8 to 47.6).

The relative risk was 0.69 (95% CI, 0.49 to 0.97; P = 0.035). The absolute risk reduction was 19 percentage points (CI, 2 to 36 percentage points), and the number needed to treat to prevent 1 patient from having syncope was 5.3 (CI, 2.8 to 47.6). The time to first syncope was longer with midodrine (hazard ratio, 0.59 [CI, 0.37 to 0.96]; P = 0.035; log-rank P = 0.031). Adverse effects were similar in both groups. Limitation: Small study size, young and healthy patients, relatively short observation period, and high proportion of patients from 1 center.

Question: Given [Meta-analysis of arbidol versus lopinavir/ritonavir in the treatment of coronavirus disease 2019. Objectives: To systematically evaluate the efficacy and safety of arbidol and lopinavir/ritonavir (LPV/r) in the treatment of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) using a meta-analysis method. Methods: The China Knowledge Network, VIP database, WanFang database PubMed database, Embase database, and Cochrane Library were searched for a collection of comparative studies on arbidol and lopinavir/ritonavir in the treatment of COVID-19. Meta-analysis was used to evaluate the efficacy and safety of Arbidol and lopinavir/ritonavir in the treatment of COVID-19. Results: The results of the systematic review indicated that Arbidol had a higher positive-to-negative conversion rate of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) nucleic acid on Day 7 (p = 0.03), a higher positive-to-negative conversion rate of SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid on Day 14 (p = 0.006), a higher improvement rate of chest computed tomography on Day 14 (p = 0.02), a lower incidence of adverse reactions (p = 0.002) and lower rate of mortality (p = 0.007). There was no difference in the rate of cough disappearance on Day 14 (p = 0.24) or the rate of severe/critical illness (p = 0.07) between the two groups. Conclusions: Arbidol may be superior to lopinavir/ritonavir in the treatment of COVID-19. However, due to the small number of included studies and the number of patients, high-quality multicenter large-sample randomized double-blind controlled trials are still needed for verification.] you can imply that [Arbidol is superior to lopinavir/ritonavir in the treatment of COVID-19.].

Question: Given [Midodrine for the Prevention of Vasovagal Syncope. Background: Recurrent vasovagal syncope is common, responds poorly to treatment, and causes physical trauma and poor quality of life. Midodrine prevents hypotension and syncope during tilt tests in patients with vasovagal syncope. Objective: To determine whether midodrine can prevent vasovagal syncope in usual clinical conditions. Design: Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial. (ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT01456481) Setting: 25 university hospitals in Canada, the United States, Mexico, and the United Kingdom. Patients: Patients with recurrent vasovagal syncope and no serious comorbid conditions. Intervention: Patients were randomly assigned 1:1 to placebo or midodrine and followed for 12 months. Measurements: The primary outcome measure was the proportion of patients with at least 1 syncope episode during follow-up. Results: The study included 133 patients who had had a median of 6 syncope episodes in the prior year (median age, 32 years; 73% female).

Question: Given [Mixed Sexually Transmitted Infections in Infertile Couples: Empirical Treatment and Influence on Semen Quality. Background: Trichomonas vaginalis (TV), Mycoplasma genitalium (MG) and Ureaplasma urealyticum (UU) are common sexually transmitted infections (STIs) that are diagnosed in infertile couples (cps). In cases with their simultaneous presence in a patient (mixed STI, MSTIs), treatment is complicated by the different sensitivity of microorganisms to antibacterial drugs. Moreover, in cases of complicated infections, the empirical treatment should be started before obtaining the results of drug susceptibilities. Objective: The objective of the current study is to find the effective and well-tolerated combination of drugs for the empirical antibacterial treatment of mixed STIs presented by TV, MG and UU in infertile couples. We also aimed to establish the influence of mixed STIs on semen quality. Methods: Our prospective study included 154 infertile couples (308 patients) with confirmed symptomatic MSTIs in one of the couples caused by the simultaneous presence of TV, MG and UU. All couples were randomized on three groups for empirical treatment: Group 1 (n=49 cps, 98 pts) who were treated by initial prescribing of anti-trichomoniasis drug Secnidazole, 2.0 g po followed by Azythromycin 500 mg on day 1 continuing by 250 mg on days 2-7; Group 2 (n=52 cps, 104 pts: Secnidazole, 2.0 g po followed by Josamycin 1000 mg bid for 12 days); Group 3 (n=53 cps, 106 pts: Secnidazole, 2.0 g po followed by Moxifloxacin 400 mg once daily for 12 days). The endpoints were clinical and microbiological cure rates as well as the frequency of side-effects in analyzed groups. We determined the basic parameters of the spermogram and Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) fragmentation levels in 59 patients with MSTIs before and at the 3rd, 6th and 9th month after pathogens eradication comparing them with results in 63 healthy sperm donors. Results: After the treatment, clinical cure rates in analyzed groups were 82.6% (Group 1) vs. 96.1% (Group 2) vs. 92.3% (Group 3). Microbiological cure rates (UU+MG) were 73.9% vs. 97.1% vs. 84.5% correspondingly (p<0.05). TV microbiological cure rates were 97.8% vs. 98.0% vs. 96.1% (p>0.05). Side-effects were registered in 28.6% vs. 12.5% vs. 18.9% cases correspondingly (p<0.05). In MSTIs patients, we registered the increasing DNA fragmentation rates, leucocytes count and decreasing semen volume, motility, vitality, sperm concentration, total spermatozoa number and number of spermatozoa with normal morphology. At the 6th month after complete pathogens eradication, these parameters approached normal values.

Question: Given [Modelling the relative benefits of using the measles vaccine outside cold chain for outbreak response. Introduction: Rapid outbreak response vaccination is a strategy for measles control and elimination. Measles vaccines must be stored and transported within a specified temperature range, but this can present significant challenges when targeting remote populations. Measles vaccine licensure for delivery outside cold chain (OCC) could provide more vaccine transport/storage space without ice packs, and a solution to shorten response times. However, due to vaccine safety and wastage considerations, the OCC strategy will require other operational changes, potentially including the use of 1-dose (monodose) instead of 10-dose vials, requiring larger transport/storage equipment currently achieved with 10-dose vials. These trade-offs require quantitative comparisons of vaccine delivery options to evaluate their relative benefits. Methods: We developed a modelling framework combining elements of the vaccine supply chain - cold chain, vial, team, and transport equipment types - with a measles transmission dynamics model to compare vaccine delivery options. We compared 10 strategies resulting from combinations of the vaccine supply elements and grouped into three main classes: OCC, partial cold chain (PCC), and full cold chain (FCC). For each strategy, we explored a campaign with 20 teams sequentially targeting 5 locations with 100,000 individuals each. We characterised the time needed to freeze ice packs and complete the campaign (campaign duration), vaccination coverage, and cases averted, assuming a fixed pre-deployment delay before campaign commencement. We performed sensitivity analyses of the pre-deployment delay, population sizes, and two team allocation schemes. Results: The OCC, PCC, and FCC strategies achieve campaign durations of 50, 51, and 52 days, respectively. Nine of the ten strategies can achieve a vaccination coverage of 80%, and OCC averts the most cases. Discussion: The OCC strategy, therefore, presents improved operational and epidemiological outcomes relative to current practice and the other options considered.] you can assume that [Measles vaccine licensure for delivery outside the cold chain presents improved operational and epidemiological outcomes relative to current practice.].

Question: Given [Leveraging network using controlled weight learning approach for thyroid cancer lymph node detection. Identification of cervical metastatic lymph nodes (LN) on I-131 post-ablation whole-body planar scans (WBS) for cancer staging is crucial for patients with papillary thyroid cancer (PTC). The existing deep network is plagued by instability in finding the under-represented LN classes on highly complex WBS, where end-to-end tuned models that can account for this uncertainty region for multi-class locations are needed. Hence, as a key contribution of this study, we designed a novel leveraging segmentation network with input guidance (LSIG) end-to-end training model without pre and post-processing features that can learn ideal parameter settings depending on the quantity of multiple-object instances. To improve the co-occurrence of classes and control the false positive regions, we proposed a re-weighting negative control (RNC) mechanism that combines two key components, namely the re-weighting (Rw) term and the negative control function (NcF). This unified approximation of weighted training would leverage the network to control and learn the desired weights of true positives towards the LN region. As an end-to-end network training, we utilize a Unet-like convolution neural network (CNN) model. The performance of the LSIG is compared with the CNN-based networks, based on the ground truth (GT) mask developed using post-ablation single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT/CT). Furthermore, the effectiveness of the two components used in the LSIG framework is evaluated on WBS datasets. Our proposed LSIG with a fully guided (Fg) LS-FgCNN model yielded a superior performance with high AUC value of 94.9%, which is 14.6% higher than the previous network for PTC.] you can assume that [A novel leveraging segmentation network with input guidance (LSIG) training model improves thyroid cancer lymph node detection by single-photon emission computed tomography.].

Question: Given [Modified EASIX predicts severe cytokine release syndrome and neurotoxicity after chimeric antigen receptor T cells. Patients who develop chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell-related severe cytokine release syndrome (CRS) and immune effector cell-associated neurotoxicity syndrome (ICANS) exhibit hemodynamic instability and endothelial activation. The EASIX (Endothelial Activation and Stress Index) score (lactate dehydrogenase [LDH; U/L] 3 creatinine [mg/dL]/platelets [PLTs; 109 cells/L]) is a marker of endothelial damage that correlates with outcomes in allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation. Elevated LDH and low PLTs have been associated with severe CRS and ICANS, as has C-reactive protein (CRP), while increased creatinine is seen only in a minority of advanced severe CRS cases. We hypothesized that EASIX and 2 new modified EASIX formulas (simplified EASIX, which excludes creatinine, and modified EASIX [m-EASIX], which replaces creatinine with CRP [mg/dL]), calculated peri-CAR T-cell infusion, would be associated with development of severe (grade $ 3) CRS and ICANS. We included 118 adults, 53 with B-acute lymphoblastic leukemia treated with 1928z CAR T cells (NCT01044069) and 65 with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma treated with axicabtagene ciloleucel or tisagenlecleucel. The 3 formulas showed similar predictive power for severe CRS and ICANS. However, low PLTs and high CRP values were the only variables individually correlated with these toxicities. Moreover, only m-EASIX was a significant predictor of disease response. m-EASIX could discriminate patients who subsequently developed severe CRS preceding the onset of severe symptoms (area under the curve [AUC] at lymphodepletion, 80.4%; at day 21, 73.0%; and at day 11, 75.4%). At day 13, it also had high discriminatory ability for severe ICANS (AUC, 73%).

Question: Given [Leveraging network using controlled weight learning approach for thyroid cancer lymph node detection. Identification of cervical metastatic lymph nodes (LN) on I-131 post-ablation whole-body planar scans (WBS) for cancer staging is crucial for patients with papillary thyroid cancer (PTC). The existing deep network is plagued by instability in finding the under-represented LN classes on highly complex WBS, where end-to-end tuned models that can account for this uncertainty region for multi-class locations are needed. Hence, as a key contribution of this study, we designed a novel leveraging segmentation network with input guidance (LSIG) end-to-end training model without pre and post-processing features that can learn ideal parameter settings depending on the quantity of multiple-object instances. To improve the co-occurrence of classes and control the false positive regions, we proposed a re-weighting negative control (RNC) mechanism that combines two key components, namely the re-weighting (Rw) term and the negative control function (NcF). This unified approximation of weighted training would leverage the network to control and learn the desired weights of true positives towards the LN region. As an end-to-end network training, we utilize a Unet-like convolution neural network (CNN) model. The performance of the LSIG is compared with the CNN-based networks, based on the ground truth (GT) mask developed using post-ablation single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT/CT). Furthermore, the effectiveness of the two components used in the LSIG framework is evaluated on WBS datasets. Our proposed LSIG with a fully guided (Fg) LS-FgCNN model yielded a superior performance with high AUC value of 94.9%, which is 14.6% higher than the previous network for PTC.] you can infer that [A novel leveraging segmentation network with input guidance (LSIG) training model improves thyroid cancer lymph node detection by single-photon emission computed tomography.].

Question: Given [Modified EASIX predicts severe cytokine release syndrome and neurotoxicity after chimeric antigen receptor T cells. Patients who develop chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell-related severe cytokine release syndrome (CRS) and immune effector cell-associated neurotoxicity syndrome (ICANS) exhibit hemodynamic instability and endothelial activation. The EASIX (Endothelial Activation and Stress Index) score (lactate dehydrogenase [LDH; U/L] 3 creatinine [mg/dL]/platelets [PLTs; 109 cells/L]) is a marker of endothelial damage that correlates with outcomes in allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation. Elevated LDH and low PLTs have been associated with severe CRS and ICANS, as has C-reactive protein (CRP), while increased creatinine is seen only in a minority of advanced severe CRS cases. We hypothesized that EASIX and 2 new modified EASIX formulas (simplified EASIX, which excludes creatinine, and modified EASIX [m-EASIX], which replaces creatinine with CRP [mg/dL]), calculated peri-CAR T-cell infusion, would be associated with development of severe (grade $ 3) CRS and ICANS. We included 118 adults, 53 with B-acute lymphoblastic leukemia treated with 1928z CAR T cells (NCT01044069) and 65 with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma treated with axicabtagene ciloleucel or tisagenlecleucel. The 3 formulas showed similar predictive power for severe CRS and ICANS. However, low PLTs and high CRP values were the only variables individually correlated with these toxicities. Moreover, only m-EASIX was a significant predictor of disease response. m-EASIX could discriminate patients who subsequently developed severe CRS preceding the onset of severe symptoms (area under the curve [AUC] at lymphodepletion, 80.4%; at day 21, 73.0%; and at day 11, 75.4%).

Question: Given [A pilot study on controlling coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) inflammation using melatonin supplement. No effective antiviral drugs and vaccines are available for the treatment of patients with severe coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19). Therefore, available, safe, and inexpensive drugs and supplements such as melatonin are among the proposed options for controlling inflammation. We did a randomized, single-blind study in Imam Khomeini Hospital between June 30, 2020, and August 5, 2020. Mild to moderate COVID-19 patients aged 25-65 years were eligible to enter the study based on chest CT scan, clinical symptoms, and physician diagnosis. The intervention group was prescribed 6 mg of oral melatonin for 2 weeks, which consumed half an hour before bedtime every night in low light conditions. Clinical symptoms and C-reactive protein (CRP) were measured before and after treatment in the melatonin received and control (regular medications) groups. Among screened patients with COVID-19, 14 patients were assigned to receive melatonin, and 17 patients were considered as controls. A significant difference (p=0.005) between CRP 1 and CRP 2 levels (before and after using melatonin) was found in the melatonin group while this difference (p=0.069) was not significant in the control group. Also, the percentage of recovery (based on symptoms) in patients who took melatonin was higher than that of patients in the control group (85.7% VS 47.1%). The result of this study confirmed the effectiveness of melatonin in mild to moderate outpatients with COVID-19.

Question: Given [Molecular docking and dynamics simulations reveal the potential of Anti-HCV drugs to inhibit COVID-19 main protease. Background: Drug repurposing is the fastest effective method to provide treatment for coronavirus disease (COVID-19). Drugs that targeting a closely related virus with similar genetic material such as hepatitis C virus (HCV) and more specifically targeting a similar viral protease would be an excellent choice. Methods: In this study, we carried out a virtual screening for fifteen anti HCV drugs against COVID-19 main protease using computational molecular docking techniques. Moreover, Velpatasvir (4) and Sofosbuvir (13) drugs were further evaluated through molecular dynamics simulations followed by calculating the binding free energy using the molecular mechanics generalised born/solvent accessibility (MM-GBSA) approach. Results: The binding affinity descending order was N3 natural inhibitor (1), Velpatasvir (4), Sofosbuvir (13), Ombitasvir (3), Glecaprevir (2), Asunaprevir (8), Paritaprevir (10), Grazoprevir (11), Elbasvir (6), Ledipasvir (5), Daclatasvir (7), Pibrentasvir (9), Simeprevir (12), Dasabuvir (14), Taribavirin (16) and finally Ribavirin (15). Molecular dynamics simulation reveals that Sofosbuvir (13) has exciting properties and it was stable within the active site and also showed good MM-GBSA compared to the natural inhibitor N3. Conclusion: Our results could be auspicious for fast repurposing of the examined drugs either alone or in combinations with each other for the treatment of the COVID-19. Furthermore, this work provides a clear spot on the structure-activity relationship (SAR) for targeting the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) main protease and helps the design and synthesis of new drugs in the future targeting it as well.

Question: Given [Inulin Fermentable Fiber Ameliorates Type I Diabetes via IL22 and Short-Chain Fatty Acids in Experimental Models. Background & Aims: Nourishment of gut microbiota via consumption of fermentable fiber promotes gut health and guards against metabolic syndrome. In contrast, how dietary fiber impacts type 1 diabetes is less clear. Methods: To examine impact of dietary fibers on development of type 1 diabetes in the streptozotocin (STZ)-induced and spontaneous non-obese diabetes (NOD) models, mice were fed grain-based chow (GBC) or compositionally defined diets enriched with a fermentable fiber (inulin) or an insoluble fiber (cellulose). Spontaneous (NOD mice) or STZ-induced (wild-type mice) diabetes was monitored. Results: Relative to GBC, low-fiber diets exacerbated STZ-induced diabetes, whereas diets enriched with inulin, but not cellulose, strongly protected against or treated it. Inulin's restoration of glycemic control prevented loss of adipose depots, while reducing food and water consumption. Inulin normalized pancreatic function and markedly enhanced insulin sensitivity. Such amelioration of diabetes was associated with alterations in gut microbiota composition and was eliminated by antibiotic administration. Pharmacologic blockade of fermentation reduced inulin's beneficial impact on glycemic control, indicating a role for short-chain fatty acids (SCFA). Furthermore, inulin's microbiota-dependent anti-diabetic effect associated with SCFA-independent restoration of interleukin 22, which was necessary and sufficient to ameliorate STZ-induced diabetes. Inulin-enriched diets significantly delayed diabetes in NOD mice.

Objective Effective antimicrobial containment strategies such as Antimicrobial Stewardship Programs (ASPs) require comprehensive data on antibiotics use which are scarce in Ethiopia. This study sought to assess antibiotics use and healthcare-associated infections (HCAIs) in Ethiopian public hospitals. Design We conducted a cross-sectional study using the WHO point-prevalence survey protocol for systemic antibiotics use and HCAIs for low/middle-income countries. Setting The study was conducted among 10 public hospitals in 2021. Participants All patients admitted to adult and paediatric inpatient and emergency wards before or at 08:00 on the survey date were enrolled. Outcome measure The primary outcome measures were the prevalence of antibiotic use, HCAIs and the hospitals' readiness to implement ASP. Results Data were collected from 1820 patient records. None of the surveyed hospitals had functional ASP. The common indication for antibiotics was for HCAIs (40.3%). Pneumonia was the most common bacterial infection (28.6%) followed by clinical sepsis (17.8%). Most treatments were empiric (96.7%) and the overall prevalence of antibiotic use was 63.8% with antibiotics prescription per patient ratio of 1.77. Ceftriaxone was the most commonly prescribed antibiotic (30.4%) followed by metronidazole (15.4%). Age, having HIV infection, ward type, type of hospital, catheterisation and intubation history had significant association with antibiotic use. Patients who were treated in paediatric surgical wards were about four times more likely to be on antibiotics compared with patients treated at an adult emergency ward. Patients on urinary catheter (adjusted OR (AOR)=2.74, 95% CI: 2.04 to 3.68) and intubation device (AOR=2.62, 95% CI: 1.02 to 6.76) were more likely to be on antibiotics than their non-intubated/non-catheterised counterparts. Patients treated at secondary-level hospitals had 0.34 times lower odds of being on antibiotics compared with those in tertiary hospitals. Conclusions Antibiotic use across the surveyed hospitals was common and most were empiric which has both practical and policy implications for strengthening ASP and promoting rational antibiotics use.

Patients on urinary catheter (adjusted OR (AOR)=2.74, 95% CI: 2.04 to 3.68) and intubation device (AOR=2.62, 95% CI: 1.02 to 6.76) were more likely to be on antibiotics than their non-intubated/non-catheterised counterparts. Patients treated at secondary-level hospitals had 0.34 times lower odds of being on antibiotics compared with those in tertiary hospitals. Conclusions Antibiotic use across the surveyed hospitals was common and most were empiric which has both practical and policy implications for strengthening ASP and promoting rational antibiotics use.

Question: Given [Multifunctional lipid-based nanoparticles for codelivery of anticancer drugs and sirna for treatment of non-small cell lung cancer with different level of resistance and egfr mutations. Resistance to chemotherapy, enhanced proliferation, invasion, angiogenesis, and metastasis (RPIAM) represent major obstacles that limit the efficacy of cancer treatment especially in advanced stages of cancer. Overcoming or suppressing RPIAM can dramatically improve the treatment out-come. Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is frequently diagnosed in an advanced stage and often possesses intrinsic resistance to chemotherapy accompanied by the fast development of acquired resistance during the treatment. Oncogenic receptor tyrosine kinases (TKs), specifically epidermal growth factor (EGF) TKs, play an important role in the activation of MAPK/PI3K/Akt/STAT pathways, finally leading to the development of RPIAM. However, the suppression of EGF-TK by different drugs is limited by various defensive mechanisms and mutations. In order to effectively prevent the development of RPIAM in NSCLC, we formulated and tested a multicomponent and multifunctional cancer targeted delivery system containing Nanostructured Lipid Carriers (NLCs) as vehicles, luteinizing hormone release hormone (LHRH) as a cancer targeting moiety, EFG-TK inhibitor gefitinib and/or paclitaxel as anticancer drug(s), siRNA targeted to EGF receptor (EGFR) mRNA as a suppressor of EGF receptors, and an imaging agent (rhodamine) for the visualization of cancer cells. Experimental data obtained show that this complex delivery system possesses significantly enhanced anticancer activity that cannot be achieved by individual components applied separately.] you can assume that [A complex delivery system composed of multifunctional lipid-based nanoparticles for co-delivery of anticancer drugs and siRNA shows enhanced anticancer activity for the treatment of non-small cell lung cancer cells.].

Question: Given [Life-Threatening Docetaxel Toxicity in a Patient With Reduced-Function CYP3A Variants: A Case Report. Docetaxel therapy occasionally causes severe and life-threatening toxicities. Some docetaxel toxicities are related to exposure, and inter-individual variability in exposure has been described based on genetic variation and drug-drug interactions that impact docetaxel clearance. Cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4) and CYP3A5 metabolize docetaxel into inactive metabolites, and this is the primary mode of docetaxel clearance.

However, since these variants in CYP3A4 are rare, little is known about the safety of docetaxel in patients who are homozygous for the reduced-function CYP3A4 variants. Here we present a case of life-threatening (grade 4) pneumonitis, dyspnea, and neutropenia resulting from a single dose of docetaxel. This patient was (1) homozygous for CYP3A4*22, which causes reduced expression and is associated with increased docetaxel-related adverse events, (2) heterozygous for CYP3A4*3, a rare reduced-function missense variant, and (3) homozygous for CYP3A5*3, a common loss of function splicing defect that has been associated with increased docetaxel exposure and adverse events. The patient also carried functional variants in other genes involved in docetaxel pharmacokinetics that may have increased his risk of toxicity. We identified one additional CYP3A4*22 homozygote that received docetaxel in our research cohort, and present this case of severe hematological toxicity. Furthermore, the one other CYP3A4*22 homozygous patient we identified from the literature died from docetaxel toxicity.

In this study, we further showed that the ALCAM-EGF/EGFR axis regulated the MM side population (SP)-mediated drug-resistance. ALCAM-knockdown MM cells displayed an enhanced ratio of SP cells in the presence of bone marrow stromal cells (BMSCs) or with the supplement of recombinant EGF. SP MM cells were resistant to chemotherapeutics melphalan or bortezomib. Drug treatment stimulated SP-genesis. Mechanistically, EGFR, primed with EGF, activated the hedgehog pathway and promoted the SP ratio; meanwhile, ALCAM inhibited EGFR downstream pro-MM cell signaling. Further, SP MM cells exhibited an increased number of mitochondria compared to the main population. Interference of the mitochondria function strongly inhibited SP-genesis.

Question: Given [Case report: Proton pump inhibitor drug-related problem in pancreatic cancer patient unmasks pancreatic enzyme insufficiency. Introduction: Palliative care aims to improve the quality of life of patients with a life-limiting or life-threatening illness and is multifaceted involving comprehensive interdisciplinary assessments and interventions. Interdisciplinary palliative care in the setting of untreatable cancer diagnoses is of particular importance due to additional considerations that must be taken as patients are often undergoing palliative chemotherapy and/or radiation therapy. These patients' complexity warrants special considerations and attentiveness to drug-related problems. Case report: The purpose of this case report is to highlight the importance of both complete and comprehensive medication histories in cancer care and the impact of proton pump inhibitors on pancreatic enzyme insufficiencies secondary to pancreatic cancers. This case involves a drug-related problem involving three medications that are commonly used in pancreatic cancer patients: pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy, a proton pump inhibitor, and a fluoroquinolone antibiotic. The patient presented in this case report is an 80-year-old man diagnosed with unresectable pancreatic cancer with a history of symptomatic gastroesophageal reflux disease managed with a proton pump inhibitor, specifically tablets of the 40 mg strength of pantoprazole magnesium taken orally once daily. During the patient's first of five 28-day cycles of palliative-intent chemotherapy with gemcitabine and nab-paclitaxel, the patient presented to the emergency department due to fever and, although not severely neutropenic, was prescribed amoxicillin/clavulanate and ciprofloxacin due to his advanced age. After reading a patient advisory on a ciprofloxacin patient information sheet that advised avoidance of concomitant administration of ciprofloxacin and magnesium, the patient self-discontinued his pantoprazole as it was a magnesium salt formulation. This discontinuation was followed by two weeks of persistent foul-smelling diarrhea, flatulence, and abdominal pain. Management and outcome: The patient's healthcare team symptomatically managed the patient with oral and intravenous rehydration unaware of the cause of the symptoms.

Question: Given [Case report: Proton pump inhibitor drug-related problem in pancreatic cancer patient unmasks pancreatic enzyme insufficiency. Introduction: Palliative care aims to improve the quality of life of patients with a life-limiting or life-threatening illness and is multifaceted involving comprehensive interdisciplinary assessments and interventions. Interdisciplinary palliative care in the setting of untreatable cancer diagnoses is of particular importance due to additional considerations that must be taken as patients are often undergoing palliative chemotherapy and/or radiation therapy. These patients' complexity warrants special considerations and attentiveness to drug-related problems. Case report: The purpose of this case report is to highlight the importance of both complete and comprehensive medication histories in cancer care and the impact of proton pump inhibitors on pancreatic enzyme insufficiencies secondary to pancreatic cancers. This case involves a drug-related problem involving three medications that are commonly used in pancreatic cancer patients: pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy, a proton pump inhibitor, and a fluoroquinolone antibiotic. The patient presented in this case report is an 80-year-old man diagnosed with unresectable pancreatic cancer with a history of symptomatic gastroesophageal reflux disease managed with a proton pump inhibitor, specifically tablets of the 40 mg strength of pantoprazole magnesium taken orally once daily. During the patient's first of five 28-day cycles of palliative-intent chemotherapy with gemcitabine and nab-paclitaxel, the patient presented to the emergency department due to fever and, although not severely neutropenic, was prescribed amoxicillin/clavulanate and ciprofloxacin due to his advanced age. After reading a patient advisory on a ciprofloxacin patient information sheet that advised avoidance of concomitant administration of ciprofloxacin and magnesium, the patient self-discontinued his pantoprazole as it was a magnesium salt formulation. This discontinuation was followed by two weeks of persistent foul-smelling diarrhea, flatulence, and abdominal pain. Management and outcome: The patient's healthcare team symptomatically managed the patient with oral and intravenous rehydration unaware of the cause of the symptoms. A trial of pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy was initiated; however, it was unsuccessful in resolving his symptoms. After further investigation and a more in-depth patient interview, it was discovered that the discontinued proton pump inhibitor was likely the cause of the patient's new symptoms and was subsequently re-initiated.

Question: Given [Meropenem Target Attainment and Population Pharmacokinetics in Critically Ill Septic Patients with Preserved or Increased Renal Function. Purpose: Critically ill patients with preserved or increased renal function have been shown to be at risk of underexposure to meropenem. Although many meropenem population pharmacokinetic (PK) models have been published, there is no large prospective population PK study with rich sampling focusing on patients most at risk of suboptimal pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) target attainment. Therefore, the aim of the present study was to evaluate PK/PD target attainment and to perform a thorough covariate screening using population PK modelling of meropenem in septic patients with preserved or increased renal function. Patients and Methods: A single-centre prospective observational PK study was performed in the intensive care unit (ICU) of the University Hospitals Leuven. Patients with severe sepsis or septic shock and treated with meropenem in the ICU were screened for inclusion. Patients were excluded if they received renal replacement therapy or had an estimated glomerular filtration rate according to the Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology collaboration equation <70 mL/min/1.73m2 on the day of PK sampling. Successful PK/PD target attainment was defined as an unbound meropenem trough concentration above 2 mg/L or 8 mg/L. Population PK modelling was performed with NONMEM7.4. Results: In total, 58 patients were included, contributing 345 plasma samples over 70 dosing intervals. The 2 mg/L and 8 mg/L targets were successfully attained in 46% and 11% of all dosing intervals, respectively. A two-compartment population PK model with linear elimination and interindividual variability on clearance best described meropenem PK. The estimated creatinine clearance according to the Cockcroft-Gault equation was the only covariate retained during population PK analysis. Conclusion: This study provided detailed insight into meropenem PK in critically ill patients with preserved or increased renal function.

Netrin 1 is currently being evaluated as a therapeutic target. These receptors, known as dependence receptors, and their ligands, have not yet been extensively explored in hematological malignancies. Here, we performed a screening of various human myeloma cell lines and bone marrow samples from multiple myeloma patients for netrin-1 and its receptors to determine the expression of netrin 1 and its receptors in multiple myeloma as well as to assess the potential anti-myeloma activity of a novel anti-netrin-1 treatment (NP137). Our results showed heterogeneous expression of netrin-1 and its receptors DCC and UNC5H2(B) in six human myeloma lines. Additionally, immunohistochemistry and flow cytometry showed expression of these molecules in a majority of myeloma patient samples. In vitro NP137 did not induce apoptosis of myeloma cell lines yet enhanced the cytotoxicity of bortezomib and dexamethasone. In vivo, NP137 treatment of SCID mice with established RPMI8226 myeloma tumors led to a reduction of tumor size compared to controls.

Study Design Present work is an in vitro study. Setting The study conducted at an academic research laboratory. Materials and Methods An in vitro study on automated high-throughput screening of chordoma cells was performed using a library of 1,406 drugs as both mono- and combination therapies with PI3K inhibitors. Combination indices were determined for dual therapies and synergistic outliers were identified as potential therapeutic agents. T (brachyury) siRNA knockdown in combination with PI3K pathway inhibition was also assessed. Results Fifty-nine combination therapies were identified as having potential therapeutic efficacy. Effective combinations included PI3K inhibitors with GSK1838705A (ALK/IGF-1R inhibitor), LY2874455 (VEGFR/FGFR inhibitor), El1 (selective Ezh2 inhibitor), and (-)-p-bromotetramisole oxalate (alkaline phosphatase inhibitor).

Question: Given [Nicotinamide and Pyruvate for Neuroenhancement in Open-Angle Glaucoma: A Phase 2 Randomized Clinical Trial. Importance: Open-angle glaucoma may continue to progress despite significant lowering of intraocular pressure (IOP). Preclinical research has suggested that enhancing mitochondrial function and energy production may enhance retinal ganglion cell survival in animal models of glaucoma, but there is scant information on its effectiveness in a clinical setting. Objective: To test the hypothesis that a combination of nicotinamide and pyruvate can improve retinal ganglion cell function in human glaucoma as measured with standard automated perimetry. Design, Setting, and Participants: In this phase 2, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial at a single academic institution, 197 patients were assessed for eligibility. Of these, 42 patients with treated open-angle glaucoma and moderate visual field loss in at least 1 eye were selected for inclusion and randomized. A total of 32 completed the study and were included in the final analysis. The mean (SD) age was 64.6 (9.8) years. Twenty-one participants (66%) were female. Participant race and ethnicity data were collected via self-report to ensure the distribution reflected that observed in clinical practice in the US but are not reported here to protect patient privacy. Recruitment took place in April 2019 and patients were monitored through December 2020. Data were analyzed from January to May 2021. Interventions: Ascending oral doses of nicotinamide (1000 to 3000 mg) and pyruvate (1500 to 3000 mg) vs placebo (2:1 randomization). Main Outcomes and Measures: Number of visual field test locations improving beyond normal variability in the study eye. Secondary end points were the rates of change of visual field global indices (mean deviation [MD], pattern standard deviation [PSD], and visual field index [VFI]). Results: Twenty-two of 29 participants (76%) randomized to the intervention group and 12 of 13 participants (92%) randomized to placebo received their allocation, and 32 participants (32 eyes; ratio 21:11) completed the study (21 from the intervention group and 11 from the placebo group). Median (IQR) follow-up time was 2.2 (2.0-2.4) months. No serious adverse events were reported during the study. The number of improving test locations was significantly higher in the treatment group than in the placebo group (median [IQR], 15 [6-25] vs 7 [6-11]; P =.005). Rates of change of PSD suggested improvement with treatment compared with placebo (median, -0.06 vs 0.02 dB per week; 95% CI, 0.02 to 0.24; P =.02) but not MD (0.04 vs -0.002 dB per week; 95% CI, -0.27 to 0.09; P =.35) or VFI (0.09 vs -0.02% per week; 95% CI, -0.53 to 0.36; P =.71). Conclusions and Relevance: A combination of nicotinamide and pyruvate yielded significant short-term improvement in visual function, supporting prior experimental research suggesting a role for these agents in neuroprotection for individuals with glaucoma and confirming the need for long-term studies to establish their usefulness in slowing progression.

Recruitment took place in April 2019 and patients were monitored through December 2020. Data were analyzed from January to May 2021. Interventions: Ascending oral doses of nicotinamide (1000 to 3000 mg) and pyruvate (1500 to 3000 mg) vs placebo (2:1 randomization). Main Outcomes and Measures: Number of visual field test locations improving beyond normal variability in the study eye. Secondary end points were the rates of change of visual field global indices (mean deviation [MD], pattern standard deviation [PSD], and visual field index [VFI]). Results: Twenty-two of 29 participants (76%) randomized to the intervention group and 12 of 13 participants (92%) randomized to placebo received their allocation, and 32 participants (32 eyes; ratio 21:11) completed the study (21 from the intervention group and 11 from the placebo group). Median (IQR) follow-up time was 2.2 (2.0-2.4) months. No serious adverse events were reported during the study. The number of improving test locations was significantly higher in the treatment group than in the placebo group (median [IQR], 15 [6-25] vs 7 [6-11]; P =.005). Rates of change of PSD suggested improvement with treatment compared with placebo (median, -0.06 vs 0.02 dB per week; 95% CI, 0.02 to 0.24; P =.02) but not MD (0.04 vs -0.002 dB per week; 95% CI, -0.27 to 0.09; P =.35) or VFI (0.09 vs -0.02% per week; 95% CI, -0.53 to 0.36; P =.71). Conclusions and Relevance: A combination of nicotinamide and pyruvate yielded significant short-term improvement in visual function, supporting prior experimental research suggesting a role for these agents in neuroprotection for individuals with glaucoma and confirming the need for long-term studies to establish their usefulness in slowing progression.

Question: Given [Advancement of PI3 Kinase Inhibitor Combination Therapies for PI3K-Aberrant Chordoma. Objectives Targeted inhibitors of the PI3 kinase (PI3K) pathway have shown promising but incomplete antitumor activity in preclinical chordoma models. The aim of this study is to advance methodology for a high-throughput drug screen using chordoma models to identify new combination therapies for chordoma. Study Design Present work is an in vitro study. Setting The study conducted at an academic research laboratory. Materials and Methods An in vitro study on automated high-throughput screening of chordoma cells was performed using a library of 1,406 drugs as both mono- and combination therapies with PI3K inhibitors. Combination indices were determined for dual therapies and synergistic outliers were identified as potential therapeutic agents. T (brachyury) siRNA knockdown in combination with PI3K pathway inhibition was also assessed. Results Fifty-nine combination therapies were identified as having potential therapeutic efficacy. Effective combinations included PI3K inhibitors with GSK1838705A (ALK/IGF-1R inhibitor), LY2874455 (VEGFR/FGFR inhibitor), El1 (selective Ezh2 inhibitor), and (-)-p-bromotetramisole oxalate (alkaline phosphatase inhibitor). The top ranking targets identified included ALK, PDGFR, VEGFR, aurora kinase, and BCL-2. T (brachyury) inhibition produced significant reduction in cell viability and growth; however PI3K inhibition in combination with T (brachyury) knockdown did not result in further reduction in growth and viability in vitro. Conclusion High throughput with in vitro combination screening is feasible with chordoma cells and allows for rapid identification of synergistic dual-therapies. Potential combination therapies and targetable pathways were identified. T (brachyury) knockdown produced significant reduction in cell viability, but did not show additional benefit with PI3K pathway inhibition in this model. Further in vitro and in vivo validation of these therapeutic combinations is warranted.] you can imply that [T (brachyury) siRNA knockdown in combination with PI3K pathway inhibition has a synergistic effect in PI3K-aberrant chordoma therapy.].

Question: Given [Nicotinamide and Pyruvate for Neuroenhancement in Open-Angle Glaucoma: A Phase 2 Randomized Clinical Trial. Importance: Open-angle glaucoma may continue to progress despite significant lowering of intraocular pressure (IOP). Preclinical research has suggested that enhancing mitochondrial function and energy production may enhance retinal ganglion cell survival in animal models of glaucoma, but there is scant information on its effectiveness in a clinical setting. Objective: To test the hypothesis that a combination of nicotinamide and pyruvate can improve retinal ganglion cell function in human glaucoma as measured with standard automated perimetry. Design, Setting, and Participants: In this phase 2, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial at a single academic institution, 197 patients were assessed for eligibility.

Question: Given [Disulfiram-loaded lactoferrin nanoparticles for treating inflammatory diseases. Sepsis is a dysregulated immune response to infection and potentially leads to life-threatening organ dysfunction, which is often seen in serious Covid-19 patients. Disulfiram (DSF), an old drug that has been used to treat alcohol addiction for decades, has recently been identified as a potent inhibitor of the gasdermin D (GSDMD)-induced pore formation that causes pyroptosis and inflammatory cytokine release. Therefore, DSF represents a promising therapeutic for the treatment of inflammatory disorders. Lactoferrin (LF) is a multifunctional glycoprotein with potent antibacterial and anti-inflammatory activities that acts by neutralizing circulating endotoxins and activating cellular responses. In addition, LF has been well exploited as a drug nanocarrier and targeting ligands. In this study, we developed a DSF-LF nanoparticulate system (DSF-LF NP) for combining the immunosuppressive activities of both DSF and LF. DSF-LF NPs could effectively block pyroptosis and inflammatory cytokine release from macrophages. Treatment with DSF-LF NPs showed remarkable therapeutic effects on lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced sepsis. In addition, this therapeutic strategy was also applied to treat ulcerative colitis (UC), and substantial treatment efficacy was achieved in a murine colitis model. The underlying mode of action of these DSF-LF-NPs may contribute to efficiently suppressing macrophage-mediated inflammatory responses and ameliorating the complications caused by sepsis and UC. As macrophage pyroptosis plays a pivotal role in inflammation, this safe and effective biomimetic nanomedicine may offer a versatile therapeutic strategy for treating various inflammatory diseases by repurposing DSF.

Question: Given [Case Report: Preemptive Treatment With Low-Dose PD-1 Blockade and Azacitidine for Molecular Relapsed Acute Myeloid Leukemia With RUNX1-RUNX1T1 After Allogeneic Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation. Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients who develop hematological relapse (HR) after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) generally have dismal clinical outcomes. Measurable residual disease (MRD)-directed preemptive interventions are effective approaches to prevent disease progression and improve prognosis for molecular relapsed patients with warning signs of impending HR. In this situation, boosting the graft-vs-leukemia (GVL) effect with immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) might be a promising prevention strategy, despite the potential for causing severe graft-vs-host disease (GVHD). In the present study, we reported for the first time an AML patient with RUNX1-RUNX1T1 who underwent preemptive treatment with the combined application of tislelizumab (an anti-PD-1 antibody) and azacitidine to avoid HR following allo-HSCT. On day +81, molecular relapse with MRD depicted by RUNX1-RUN1T1-positivity as well as mixed donor chimerism occurred in the patient. On day +95, with no signs of GVHD and an excellent eastern cooperative oncology group performance status (ECOG PS), the patient thus was administered with 100 mg of tislelizumab on day 1 and 100 mg of azacitidine on days 1-7. After the combination therapy, complete remission was successfully achieved with significant improvement in hematologic response, and the MRD marker RUNX1-RUNX1T1 turned negative, along with a complete donor chimerism in bone marrow. Meanwhile, the patient experienced moderate GVHD and immune-related adverse events (irAEs), successively involving the lung, liver, lower digestive tract and urinary system, which were well controlled by immunosuppressive therapies. As far as we know, this case is the first one to report the use of tislelizumab in combination with azacitidine to prevent post-transplant relapse in AML.

Question: Given [Meropenem Target Attainment and Population Pharmacokinetics in Critically Ill Septic Patients with Preserved or Increased Renal Function. Purpose: Critically ill patients with preserved or increased renal function have been shown to be at risk of underexposure to meropenem. Although many meropenem population pharmacokinetic (PK) models have been published, there is no large prospective population PK study with rich sampling focusing on patients most at risk of suboptimal pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) target attainment. Therefore, the aim of the present study was to evaluate PK/PD target attainment and to perform a thorough covariate screening using population PK modelling of meropenem in septic patients with preserved or increased renal function. Patients and Methods: A single-centre prospective observational PK study was performed in the intensive care unit (ICU) of the University Hospitals Leuven. Patients with severe sepsis or septic shock and treated with meropenem in the ICU were screened for inclusion. Patients were excluded if they received renal replacement therapy or had an estimated glomerular filtration rate according to the Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology collaboration equation <70 mL/min/1.73m2 on the day of PK sampling. Successful PK/PD target attainment was defined as an unbound meropenem trough concentration above 2 mg/L or 8 mg/L. Population PK modelling was performed with NONMEM7.4. Results: In total, 58 patients were included, contributing 345 plasma samples over 70 dosing intervals. The 2 mg/L and 8 mg/L targets were successfully attained in 46% and 11% of all dosing intervals, respectively. A two-compartment population PK model with linear elimination and interindividual variability on clearance best described meropenem PK. The estimated creatinine clearance according to the Cockcroft-Gault equation was the only covariate retained during population PK analysis.

Question: Given [Off-Label Use of Intravenous Olanzapine for Agitation After Neurologic Injury. Background: Small studies have described the off-label use of intravenous (IV) olanzapine for the management of acute agitation. Objective: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of IV olanzapine to manage acutely agitated patients with neurological injuries. Methods: This was a retrospective analysis of IV olanzapine use in patients admitted to the neurotrauma and neurovascular intensive care units at a single academic center. The primary endpoint was the requirement of additional IV olanzapine, IV benzodiazepine, or IV haloperidol within 60 minutes from the time of first IV olanzapine dose. Secondary safety endpoints included QTc prolongation and respiratory depression. Results: Forty-six patients received IV olanzapine during the study period. One patient required an additional dose of IV olanzapine and two patients received benzodiazepine or antipsychotic agents within 60 minutes of IV olanzapine administration. One patient had a post-administration QTc level >500 ms. Two patients had an increased oxygen requirement, but none required intubation. Conclusion: IV olanzapine appears to be efficacious in reducing the need for sedatives and antipsychotics with low risk for QTc prolongation and respiratory depression in acutely agitated patients with neurological injuries.] you can assume that [Off-label use of intravenous olanzapine prolongs respiratory depression in acutely agitated patients with neurological injuries.].

Question: Given [Meropenem Target Attainment and Population Pharmacokinetics in Critically Ill Septic Patients with Preserved or Increased Renal Function. Purpose: Critically ill patients with preserved or increased renal function have been shown to be at risk of underexposure to meropenem. Although many meropenem population pharmacokinetic (PK) models have been published, there is no large prospective population PK study with rich sampling focusing on patients most at risk of suboptimal pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) target attainment. Therefore, the aim of the present study was to evaluate PK/PD target attainment and to perform a thorough covariate screening using population PK modelling of meropenem in septic patients with preserved or increased renal function. Patients and Methods: A single-centre prospective observational PK study was performed in the intensive care unit (ICU) of the University Hospitals Leuven. Patients with severe sepsis or septic shock and treated with meropenem in the ICU were screened for inclusion. Patients were excluded if they received renal replacement therapy or had an estimated glomerular filtration rate according to the Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology collaboration equation <70 mL/min/1.73m2 on the day of PK sampling. Successful PK/PD target attainment was defined as an unbound meropenem trough concentration above 2 mg/L or 8 mg/L. Population PK modelling was performed with NONMEM7.4. Results: In total, 58 patients were included, contributing 345 plasma samples over 70 dosing intervals. The 2 mg/L and 8 mg/L targets were successfully attained in 46% and 11% of all dosing intervals, respectively. A two-compartment population PK model with linear elimination and interindividual variability on clearance best described meropenem PK. The estimated creatinine clearance according to the Cockcroft-Gault equation was the only covariate retained during population PK analysis.

Question: Given [Postinfection Irritable Bowel Syndrome Following Clostridioides difficile Infection: A Systematic-review and Meta-analysis. Background: Postinfection irritable bowel syndrome (PI-IBS) affects 14% patients after acute bacterial enterocolitis. Aim: The aim of this study was to conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis to find the prevalence of PI-IBS following Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI). Methods: We systematically searched Medline, Embase, and Web of Science from inception through January 20, 2020 for cohort studies assessing PI-IBS following CDI. Primary outcome was pooled prevalence calculated using inverse variance heterogeneity model [MetaXL (v. 5.3)]. A priori subgroup analyses were done [by irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) diagnostic criteria-Rome vs. others, time of IBS diagnosis-<6 or >6 mo, exclusion or inclusion of pre-existing IBS and CDI treatment-antibiotic with fecal microbiota transplantation vs. antibiotic only]. Heterogeneity was considered substantial if I 2>50%. Results: From 2007 to 2019, 15 studies were included (10 prospective, 5 retrospective; 9 full-text, 6 abstracts). Data from 1218 patients were included in the quantitative analysis. Risk of bias was low in 7, medium in 4 and high in 4 studies. Pooled prevalence of PI-IBS was 21.1% (95% confidence interval, 8.2%-35.7%), I 2=96%. Common PI-IBS subtypes were diarrhea-predominant in 46.3% (50) patients, and mixed in 33.3% (36) patients. Subgroup analyses by IBS diagnostic criteria, time of IBS diagnosis or CDI treatment did not significantly change the primary outcome (all P>0.05), nor decrease heterogeneity. Funnel plot analysis revealed publication bias. Conclusions: Over 20% of patients develop PI-IBS after CDI. Factors such as diagnostic criteria for IBS and CDI treatment did not affect prevalence, though small numbers limit the confidence in these conclusions.

Question: Given [Raloxifene in the Treatment of Osteoporosis in Postmenopausal Women with End-Stage Renal Disease: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis. As a selective estrogen receptor modulator (SERM), raloxifene is used in healthy postmenopausal women to prevent bone loss and reduce fractures. However, the benefit of raloxifene is uncertain in the treatment of osteoporosis among patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) or those who require maintenance dialysis. We assessed the safety and efficacy of raloxifene in this particular population. Studies were selected from PubMed, Springer, CNKI (Chinese National Knowledge Infrastructure) and Wanfang Database. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and prospective studies with control/placebo groups were included. Five studies were included with a total of 244 participants (121 patients in the raloxifene group and 123 patients in the placebo/control group). The median duration of treatment was 12 months. The incidence rate of side effects of raloxifene was 0/121 (0%). There was a significant improvement of lumbar spine bone mineral density (BMD) levels in the raloxifene group compared with the placebo group (MD: 33.88, 95% CI: 10.93, 56.84, p=0.004). There was no significant difference concerning the improvement of femoral neck BMD (MD: 8.42, 95% CI: -10.21, 27.04, p=0.38), intact parathyroid hormone (iPTH) (MD: -12.62, 95% CI: -35.36, 10.13, p=0.28), calcium (MD: -0.08, 95% CI: -0.61, 0.44, p=0.76), phosphorus (MD: 0.18, 95% CI: -0.12, 0.48, p=0.23) or bone alkaline phosphatase (BAP) (MD: -4.33, 95% CI: -14.44, 5.79, p=0.40).

Question: Given [Oridonin Alters Hepatic Urea Cycle via Gut Microbiota and Protects against Acetaminophen-Induced Liver Injury. Acetaminophen (APAP) hepatotoxicity is the leading cause of acute liver failure in the western world. Oridonin (OD), which is the major active ingredient of the traditional Chinese medicine Rabdosia rubescens, reportedly exerts anti-inflammatory and antioxidative effects. Here, we first find that OD protects against APAP-induced hepatotoxicity. The results of hepatic tissue-associated RNA-seq and metabolomics showed that the protective effects of OD were dependent upon urea cycle regulation. And such regulation of OD is gut microbiota partly dependent, as demonstrated by fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT).

Question: Given [Raloxifene in the Treatment of Osteoporosis in Postmenopausal Women with End-Stage Renal Disease: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis. As a selective estrogen receptor modulator (SERM), raloxifene is used in healthy postmenopausal women to prevent bone loss and reduce fractures. However, the benefit of raloxifene is uncertain in the treatment of osteoporosis among patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) or those who require maintenance dialysis. We assessed the safety and efficacy of raloxifene in this particular population. Studies were selected from PubMed, Springer, CNKI (Chinese National Knowledge Infrastructure) and Wanfang Database. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and prospective studies with control/placebo groups were included. Five studies were included with a total of 244 participants (121 patients in the raloxifene group and 123 patients in the placebo/control group). The median duration of treatment was 12 months. The incidence rate of side effects of raloxifene was 0/121 (0%).

Question: Given [Safety of the BNT162b2 mRNA Covid-19 vaccine in a nationwide setting. Background: Preapproval trials showed that messenger RNA (mRNA)-based vaccines against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) had a good safety profile, yet these trials were subject to size and patient-mix limitations. An evaluation of the safety of the BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine with respect to a broad range of potential adverse events is needed. Methods: We used data from the largest health care organization in Israel to evaluate the safety of the BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine. For each potential adverse event, in a population of persons with no previous diagnosis of that event, we individually matched vaccinated persons to unvaccinated persons according to sociodemographic and clinical variables. Risk ratios and risk differences at 42 days after vaccination were derived with the use of the Kaplan-Meier estimator. To place these results in context, we performed a similar analysis involving SARS-CoV-2-infected persons matched to uninfected persons. The same adverse events were studied in the vaccination and SARS-CoV-2 infection analyses. Results: In the vaccination analysis, the vaccinated and control groups each included a mean of 884,828 persons. Vaccination was most strongly associated with an elevated risk of myocarditis (risk ratio, 3.24; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.55 to 12.44; risk difference, 2.7 events per 100,000 persons; 95% CI, 1.0 to 4.6), lymphadenopathy (risk ratio, 2.43; 95% CI, 2.05 to 2.78; risk difference, 78.4 events per 100,000 persons; 95% CI, 64.1 to 89.3), appendicitis (risk ratio, 1.40; 95% CI, 1.02 to 2.01; risk difference, 5.0 events per 100,000 persons; 95% CI, 0.3 to 9.9), and herpes zoster infection (risk ratio, 1.43; 95% CI, 1.20 to 1.73; risk difference, 15.8 events per 100,000 persons; 95% CI, 8.2 to 24.2). SARS-CoV-2 infection was associated with a substantially increased risk of myocarditis (risk ratio, 18.28; 95% CI, 3.95 to 25.12; risk difference, 11.0 events per 100,000 persons; 95% CI, 5.6 to 15.8) and of additional serious adverse events, including pericarditis, arrhythmia, deep-vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, myocardial infarction, intracranial hemorrhage, and thrombocytopenia. Conclusions: In this study in a nationwide mass vaccination setting, the BNT162b2 vaccine was not associated with an elevated risk of most of the adverse events examined. The vaccine was associated with an excess risk of myocarditis (1 to 5 events per 100,000 persons). The risk of this potentially serious adverse event and of many other serious adverse events was substantially increased after SARS-CoV-2 infection.

Question: Given [Outcomes of patients with oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma treated with induction chemotherapy followed by concurrent chemoradiation compared with those treated with concurrent chemoradiation. Background: Induction chemotherapy (IC) has been associated with a decreased risk of distant metastasis in locally advanced head and neck squamous cell carcinoma. However, its role in the treatment of oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (OPSCC) is not well established. Methods: The outcomes of patients with OPSCC treated with IC followed by concurrent chemoradiation (CRT) were compared with the outcomes of those treated with CRT alone. The primary outcome was overall survival (OS), and the secondary end points were the times to locoregional and distant recurrence. Results: In an existing database, 585 patients met the inclusion criteria: 137 received IC plus CRT, and 448 received CRT. Most patients were positive for human papillomavirus (HPV; 90.9%). Patients receiving IC were more likely to present with a higher T stage, a higher N stage, and low neck disease. The 3-year OS rate was significantly lower in patients receiving IC (75.7%) versus CRT alone (92.9%). In a multicovariate analysis, receipt of IC (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR], 3.4; P <.001), HPV tumor status (aHR, 0.36; P =.002), and receipt of concurrent cetuximab (aHR, 2.7; P =.002) were independently associated with OS. The risk of distant metastasis was also significantly higher in IC patients (aHR, 2.8; P =.001), whereas an HPV-positive tumor status (aHR, 0.44; P =.032) and completion of therapy (aHR, 0.51; P =.034) were associated with a lower risk of distant metastasis. In HPV-positive patients, IC remained associated with distant metastatic progression (aHR, 2.6; P =.004) but not OS. Conclusions: In contrast to prior studies, IC was independently associated with worse OS and a higher risk of distant metastasis in patients with OPSCC.

Question: Given [PAX2 promoter methylation and AIB1 overexpression promote tamoxifen resistance in breast carcinoma patients. Introduction: Disease recurrence is an important obstacle in estrogen receptor positive (ER+) tamoxifen treated breast carcinoma patients. Tamoxifen resistance-related molecular mechanisms are not fully understood. Alteration in DNA methylation which contributes to transcriptional regulation of cancer-related genes plays a crucial role in tamoxifen response. In the present study, the contribution of promoter methylation and mRNA expression of PAX2 and AIB1 in the development of breast carcinoma and tamoxifen refractory was assessed. Methods: Methylation specific-high resolution melting (MS-HRM) analysis and Real-time quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) experiment were performed to analyze the promoter methylation and mRNA expression levels of PAX2 and AIB1 genes in 102 breast tumors and adjacent normal breast specimens. Results: We indicated that PAX2 expression is decreased in breast tissues due to hypermethylation in its promoter region. Compared to the adjacent normal tissues, the tumors exhibited significantly lower relative mRNA levels of PAX2 and increased expression of AIB1. Aberrant promoter methylation of PAX2 and overexpression of AIB1 was observed in tamoxifen resistance patients compared to the sensitive ones. Cox regression analysis exhibited that the increased promoter methylation status of PAX2 and overexpression of AIB1 remained as unfavorable identifiers which influence patients' survival independently. Conclusions: Our results revealed that the aberration in PAX2 promoter methylation and AIB1 overexpression are associated with the tamoxifen response in breast carcinoma patients. Further research is needed to demonstrate the potential of using PAX2 and AIB1 expression and their methylation-mediated regulation as predictive or prognostic biomarkers or as a new target therapy for better disease management.] you can assume that [Aberrations in PAX2 promoter methylation are associated with tamoxifen resistance in breast carcinoma patients.].

Question: Given [11C-radiolabeled aptamer for imaging of tumors and metastases using positron emission tomography- computed tomography. Identification of primary tumors and metastasis sites is an essential step in cancer diagnostics and the following treatment. Positron emission tomography-computed tomography (PET/CT) is one of the most reliable methods for scanning the whole organism for malignancies. In this work, we synthesized an 11C-labeled oligonucleotide primer and hybridized it to an anti-cancer DNA aptamer. The 11C-aptamer was applied for in vivo imaging of Ehrlich ascites carcinoma and its metastases in mice using PET/CT. The imaging experiments with the 11C-aptamer determined very small primary and secondary tumors of 3 mm2 and less. We also compared 11C imaging with the standard radiotracer, 2-deoxy-2-[fluorine-18]fluoro-D-glucose (18F-FDG), and found better selectivity of the 11C-aptamer to metastatic lesions in the metabolically active organs than 18F-FDG. 11C radionuclide with an ultra-short (20.38 min) half-life is considered safest for PET/CT imaging and does not cause false-positive results in heart imaging. Its combination with aptamers gives us high-specificity and high-contrast imaging of cancer cells and can be applied for PET/CT-guided drug delivery in cancer therapies.] you can imply that [11C-radiolabeled aptamer is better than 18F-FDG for imaging tumors and metastases using positron emission tomography-computed tomography.].

Question: Given [PAX2 promoter methylation and AIB1 overexpression promote tamoxifen resistance in breast carcinoma patients. Introduction: Disease recurrence is an important obstacle in estrogen receptor positive (ER+) tamoxifen treated breast carcinoma patients. Tamoxifen resistance-related molecular mechanisms are not fully understood. Alteration in DNA methylation which contributes to transcriptional regulation of cancer-related genes plays a crucial role in tamoxifen response. In the present study, the contribution of promoter methylation and mRNA expression of PAX2 and AIB1 in the development of breast carcinoma and tamoxifen refractory was assessed. Methods: Methylation specific-high resolution melting (MS-HRM) analysis and Real-time quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) experiment were performed to analyze the promoter methylation and mRNA expression levels of PAX2 and AIB1 genes in 102 breast tumors and adjacent normal breast specimens. Results: We indicated that PAX2 expression is decreased in breast tissues due to hypermethylation in its promoter region. Compared to the adjacent normal tissues, the tumors exhibited significantly lower relative mRNA levels of PAX2 and increased expression of AIB1. Aberrant promoter methylation of PAX2 and overexpression of AIB1 was observed in tamoxifen resistance patients compared to the sensitive ones. Cox regression analysis exhibited that the increased promoter methylation status of PAX2 and overexpression of AIB1 remained as unfavorable identifiers which influence patients' survival independently.

They are divided into primary, arising within a healthy gland, and secondary, observed with an underlying pre-existing lesion. Here we present the eighth case reported of a secondary abscess within a craniopharyngioma. A 59-year-old-woman presented with a 3-week history of headache, and fever. Physical examination was unremarkable. An Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) showed a pituitary lesion suggestive of a chronic inflammatory process. She was diagnosed with lymphocytic meningitis with hypophysitis and she was treated with corticosteroids. Two months later she presented with headache and fever again. Control MRI showed enlargement of the pituitary lesion. Therefore, a transsphenoidal biopsy was performed. During the procedure, purulent material was released. Histological study demonstrated a craniopharyngioma and meningeal inflammation. Empiric antibiotics were started. Three months post-operatively, a follow-up MRI showed a suspect minimal residual mass. Secondary pituitary abscesses are rare. The key to successful management is a high index of suspicion.

Question: Given [Paclitaxel-based supramolecular hydrogel loaded with mifepristone for the inhibition of breast cancer metastasis. Breast cancer is the leading cause of cancer death among women and almost all of the breast cancer-caused mortality is related to metastasis. It has been reported that glucocorticoid facilitates the metastasis of breast cancer in mice, and mifepristone can antagonize the effect of glucocorticoid. Paclitaxel is one of the important drugs in the treatment of breast cancer. Mifepristone combined with paclitaxel could be an effective strategy for inhibiting breast cancer metastasis. However, their inherent defects, in terms of short blood circulation half-life and lack of tumor targeting, not only limit their effectiveness but also cause adverse reactions. Therefore, our aim is to explore a novel protocol against breast cancer metastasis, further optimize its therapeutic efficacy by a nanodelivery system, and explore its mechanism. Herein, a paclitaxel-conjugated and mifepristone-loaded hydrogel (PM-nano) was prepared by self-assembly. Its characterizations were studied. The antimetastatic effect was evaluated in vitro and in vivo and its mechanism was also explored by western blot assay. The resultant PM-nano was developed with favorable water solubility and good biocompatibility. Moreover, PM-nano displayed increased cell uptake properties and stimulated drug release in the tumor micro-acidic environment. The PM-nano was more effective in inhibiting the proliferation and metastasis of breast cancer than other groups in vitro and in vivo. The PM-nano might inhibit metastasis through glucocorticoid receptor/receptor tyrosine kinase-like orphan receptor 1 and MMPs. Taken together, PM-nano showed superior antimetastatic effects against breast cancer and excellent biocompatibility in vitro and in vivo, providing a new option for limiting metastasis.] you can assume that [ paclitaxel-conjugated and mifepristone-loaded hydrogel showed superior antimetastatic effects against breast cancer.].

Purpose: The approval of immune checkpoint inhibitors for metastatic non-small-cell lung carcinomas (mNSCLC) treatment has presented more care options. Therefore, it is important to identify the benefit-risk trade-offs patients and caregivers are willing to make among potential treatment options. This study quantified the preferences of patients and caregivers for attributes of mNSCLC treatment. Methods: Patients with mNSCLC and caregivers completed an online survey assessing preferences using a discrete choice experiment. Respondents chose between hypothetical treatment profiles, with varying levels for 7 attributes associated with first-line treatment, including overall survival (OS), progression-free survival, select adverse events (AEs), and regimen (caregivers). Hierarchical Bayesian modeling was used to estimate attribute-level preference weights. Results: Patients (n = 308) and caregivers (n = 166) most valued increasing OS from 11 to 30 months, followed by decreasing the risk of a serious AE (grade 3/4) that may lead to hospitalization from 70% to 18%.

Patients and caregivers would accept increases in the risks of a serious AE (grade 3/4) from 18% to 70% and all grades nausea from 10% to 69% if OS increased by 16.8 and 4.0 months, respectively. The least valued attributes were all grades of pneumonitis (patients) and all grades of skin rash (caregivers). Conclusion: Patients and caregivers are willing to make trade-offs between efficacy and toxicity and may require up to 1.5 years of increased OS to accept a higher risk of AEs. These results can provide guidance to oncologists when engaging in shared-decision making discussions.] you can imply that [Patients and caregivers most valued increasing overall survival from 11 to 30 months for first-line treatments of metastatic non-small cell lung cancer.].

Question: Given [Factors Influencing Change in Serum Uric Acid After Administration of the Sodium-Glucose Cotransporter 2 Inhibitor Luseogliflozin in Patients With Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus. Although sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors lower serum uric acid, their long-term effect on uric acid metabolism is not well understood. We analyzed pooled data from studies wherein patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus received luseogliflozin, an SGLT2 inhibitor. Upon stratifying patients by baseline glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) or serum uric acid, lower HbA1c or higher serum uric acid level was associated with a greater reduction in serum uric acid after treatment. At week 12 of treatment, significant increases in urinary glucose/creatinine (Cr) ratio and urinary uric acid clearance/Cr clearance ratio (CUA/CCr ratio) and a significant reduction in serum uric acid were observed. Comparison of the subgroups of patients with a reduction or an increase in serum uric acid showed that the increase subgroup had a higher estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) at baseline, and the eGFR was significantly reduced, associated with a significant reduction in the CUA/CCr ratio. Multiple regression analysis showed that the reduction in serum uric acid in the luseogliflozin group was strongly associated with baseline high serum uric acid, low HbA1c levels, and an increase in eGFR. Luseogliflozin was shown to reduce serum uric acid by enhancing urinary uric acid excretion in association with increased urinary glucose. Treatment with luseogliflozin resulted in increased serum uric acid in some patients, which may be due to reduced glomerular filtration of uric acid via the tubuloglomerular feedback. SGLT2 inhibitors reduced serum uric acid desirably in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus with low HbA1c and high serum uric acid.] you can assume that [Luseogliflozin reduces serum uric acid desirably in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus with low HbA1c and high serum uric acid.].

Question: Given [Percutaneous Coronary Intervention in Patients With a History of Gastrointestinal Bleeding (From the Blue Cross Blue Shield of Michigan Cardiovascular Consortium). Potent antithrombotic agents are routinely prescribed after percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) to reduce ischemic complications. However, in patients who are at an increased bleeding risk, this may pose significant risks. We sought to evaluate the association between a history of gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB) and outcomes after PCI. We linked clinical registry data from PCIs performed at 48 Michigan hospitals between 1/2013 and 3/2018 to Medicare claims. We used 1:5 propensity score matching to adjust for patient characteristics. In-hospital outcomes included bleeding, transfusion, stroke or death. Post-discharge outcomes included 90-day all-cause readmission and long-term mortality. Of 30,206 patients, 1.1% had a history of GIB. Patients with a history of GIB were more likely to be older, female, and have more cardiovascular comorbidities. After matching, those with a history of GIB (n = 312) had increased post-procedural transfusions (15.7% vs 8.4%; p < 0.001), bleeding (11.9% vs 5.2%; p < 0.001), and major bleeding (2.8% vs 0.6%; p = 0.004). Ninety-day readmission rates were similar among those with and without a history of GIB (34.3% vs 31.3%; p = 0.318). There was no significant difference in post-discharge survival (1 year: 78% vs 80%; p = 0.217; 5 years: 54% vs 51%; p = 0.189).

Question: Given [Multicentre point-prevalence survey of antibiotic use and healthcare-associated infections in Ethiopian hospitals. Objective Effective antimicrobial containment strategies such as Antimicrobial Stewardship Programs (ASPs) require comprehensive data on antibiotics use which are scarce in Ethiopia. This study sought to assess antibiotics use and healthcare-associated infections (HCAIs) in Ethiopian public hospitals. Design We conducted a cross-sectional study using the WHO point-prevalence survey protocol for systemic antibiotics use and HCAIs for low/middle-income countries. Setting The study was conducted among 10 public hospitals in 2021. Participants All patients admitted to adult and paediatric inpatient and emergency wards before or at 08:00 on the survey date were enrolled. Outcome measure The primary outcome measures were the prevalence of antibiotic use, HCAIs and the hospitals' readiness to implement ASP. Results Data were collected from 1820 patient records. None of the surveyed hospitals had functional ASP. The common indication for antibiotics was for HCAIs (40.3%). Pneumonia was the most common bacterial infection (28.6%) followed by clinical sepsis (17.8%). Most treatments were empiric (96.7%) and the overall prevalence of antibiotic use was 63.8% with antibiotics prescription per patient ratio of 1.77. Ceftriaxone was the most commonly prescribed antibiotic (30.4%) followed by metronidazole (15.4%). Age, having HIV infection, ward type, type of hospital, catheterisation and intubation history had significant association with antibiotic use. Patients who were treated in paediatric surgical wards were about four times more likely to be on antibiotics compared with patients treated at an adult emergency ward. Patients on urinary catheter (adjusted OR (AOR)=2.74, 95% CI: 2.04 to 3.68) and intubation device (AOR=2.62, 95% CI: 1.02 to 6.76) were more likely to be on antibiotics than their non-intubated/non-catheterised counterparts. Patients treated at secondary-level hospitals had 0.34 times lower odds of being on antibiotics compared with those in tertiary hospitals. Conclusions Antibiotic use across the surveyed hospitals was common and most were empiric which has both practical and policy implications for strengthening ASP and promoting rational antibiotics use.

Objective: The purpose of this study is to share our experience about clinical findings, natural course, and treatment response rates of a large cohort of patients with periodic fever, aphthous stomatitis, pharyngitis, and adenitis (PFAPA) syndrome. Materials and Methods: Medical records of patients who were diagnosed with PFAPA syn- drome between January 2010 and May 2021 at Istanbul University-Cerrahpasa Cerrahpasa Medical Faculty pediatric rheumatology department were reviewed retrospectively.Results: A total of 607 patients (females: 277, males: 330) with PFAPA syndrome were included. The median duration of episodes was 3 (1-15; interquartile range (IQR) 3-5) days, and the median interval between episodes was 20 days (5-120; IQR 15-30). The median age at the last attack and median disease duration were 66 (24-168; IQR 48-84) months and 40 (4-132; IQR 27.5-60) months, respectively. Fever (100%) was the most common clinical finding, followed by pharyngitis/exudative tonsillitis in 594 (97.9%), aphthous stomatitis in 308 (50.7%), cervical lymphadenopathy in 278 (45.8%), abdominal pain in 249 (41%), and arthralgia in 228 (37.6%) of the patients. Among the clinical findings, there was no statistical difference according to gender, except for cervical lymphadenitis being higher in males (P <.001).

Question: Given [Abdominal Ischemia-Reperfusion Induced Cardiac Dysfunction Can Be Prevented by MitoTEMPO. Background: Cardiac dysfunction is secondary to acute mesenteric ischemia (AMI) and abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAA). The underlying cause of distant organ damage in the heart is the formation of oxidative stress caused by ischemia-reperfusion. In this study, we investigated the possible protective effects of a novel mitochondria-targeted antioxidant MitoTEMPO on contractile dysfunction and structural defects of the rat papillary muscle caused by abdominal ischemia-reperfusion (AIR). Methods and Results: In the experiments, adult Wistar-Albino rats were used and animals were divided randomly into 3 groups; sham-operated group (SHAM), an IR group that had aortic cross-clamping for 1 h followed by 2 h reperfusion, and a third group that received protective 0.7 mg/kg/day MitoTEMPO injection for 28-day before IR. As a result, it was observed that MitoTEMPO injection had a protective effect on the mechanical activities and structural properties of the papillary muscle impaired by AIR. Our study also showed that AIR disrupted the contractile function of the papillary muscle for each stimulation frequency and post-potentiation responses tested. This is common for each measured and calculated mechanical parameter and MitoTEMPO injection showed its protective effects. Conclusion: Consequently, calcium homeostasis seems to be impaired by AIR, and MitoTEMPO may exert its protective effect through energy metabolism by directly targeting the mitochondria.] you can assume that [A novel mitochondria-targeted antioxidant MitoTEMPO can prevent abdominal ischemia-reperfusion-induced cardiac dysfunction in rats.].

Question: Given [Peripheral Volumetric Muscle Area and Total Body Volume in Postmenopausal Women With Rheumatoid Arthritis. The effect of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) on peripheral muscle parameters is not completely understood. This study aimed to elucidate the influence of RA on peripheral muscle area and whole body skeletal muscle mass index (SMI) using peripheral quantitative computed tomography and dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry in postmenopausal women. This cross-sectional study included 54 postmenopausal women with RA and 86 healthy controls. Peripheral quantitative computed tomography and dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry were used to measure the muscle cross-sectional area and skeletal muscle mass. Muscle strength was assessed using a handheld dynamometer. Additionally, the effects of RA on muscle area and density as well as the bone / muscle area ratio were analyzed using multivariate models. The muscle area index of the thigh and forearm were correlated between both groups (RA: r = 0.357, p = 0.030; and healthy controls: r = 0.608, p < 0.001) and each index correlated with SMI in RA and healthy controls (p < 0.001). Bone / muscle area ratio correlated between forearms and thighs in health controls only (r = 0.547, p < 0.001). The RA group had a decreased thigh muscle area (p = 0.014); the fat area and fat muscle area ratio at the thigh and forearm were significantly increased (all p < 0.001), as well as thigh bone / muscle area ratio (p = 0.015). The RA group also had significantly lower forearm muscle density (p < 0.001). A sensitivity analysis excluding those on bisphosphonates led to similar results. Independent of RA, the thigh and forearm muscle area correlate with each other and with SMI. Differences in the bone / muscle ratio between RA and healthy controls may indicate regional muscle effects of inflammation and inactivity.] you can assume that [Rheumatoid arthritis has an effect on peripheral muscle parameters.].

Background: Cardiac dysfunction is secondary to acute mesenteric ischemia (AMI) and abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAA). The underlying cause of distant organ damage in the heart is the formation of oxidative stress caused by ischemia-reperfusion. In this study, we investigated the possible protective effects of a novel mitochondria-targeted antioxidant MitoTEMPO on contractile dysfunction and structural defects of the rat papillary muscle caused by abdominal ischemia-reperfusion (AIR). Methods and Results: In the experiments, adult Wistar-Albino rats were used and animals were divided randomly into 3 groups; sham-operated group (SHAM), an IR group that had aortic cross-clamping for 1 h followed by 2 h reperfusion, and a third group that received protective 0.7 mg/kg/day MitoTEMPO injection for 28-day before IR. As a result, it was observed that MitoTEMPO injection had a protective effect on the mechanical activities and structural properties of the papillary muscle impaired by AIR. Our study also showed that AIR disrupted the contractile function of the papillary muscle for each stimulation frequency and post-potentiation responses tested. This is common for each measured and calculated mechanical parameter and MitoTEMPO injection showed its protective effects. Conclusion: Consequently, calcium homeostasis seems to be impaired by AIR, and MitoTEMPO may exert its protective effect through energy metabolism by directly targeting the mitochondria.] you can infer that [A novel mitochondria-targeted antioxidant MitoTEMPO can prevent abdominal ischemia-reperfusion-induced cardiac dysfunction in rats.].

Question: Given [Peripheral Volumetric Muscle Area and Total Body Volume in Postmenopausal Women With Rheumatoid Arthritis. The effect of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) on peripheral muscle parameters is not completely understood. This study aimed to elucidate the influence of RA on peripheral muscle area and whole body skeletal muscle mass index (SMI) using peripheral quantitative computed tomography and dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry in postmenopausal women. This cross-sectional study included 54 postmenopausal women with RA and 86 healthy controls. Peripheral quantitative computed tomography and dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry were used to measure the muscle cross-sectional area and skeletal muscle mass. Muscle strength was assessed using a handheld dynamometer. Additionally, the effects of RA on muscle area and density as well as the bone / muscle area ratio were analyzed using multivariate models. The muscle area index of the thigh and forearm were correlated between both groups (RA: r = 0.357, p = 0.030; and healthy controls: r = 0.608, p < 0.001) and each index correlated with SMI in RA and healthy controls (p < 0.001). Bone / muscle area ratio correlated between forearms and thighs in health controls only (r = 0.547, p < 0.001). The RA group had a decreased thigh muscle area (p = 0.014); the fat area and fat muscle area ratio at the thigh and forearm were significantly increased (all p < 0.001), as well as thigh bone / muscle area ratio (p = 0.015). The RA group also had significantly lower forearm muscle density (p < 0.001). A sensitivity analysis excluding those on bisphosphonates led to similar results. Independent of RA, the thigh and forearm muscle area correlate with each other and with SMI.

Question: Given [Leveraging network using controlled weight learning approach for thyroid cancer lymph node detection. Identification of cervical metastatic lymph nodes (LN) on I-131 post-ablation whole-body planar scans (WBS) for cancer staging is crucial for patients with papillary thyroid cancer (PTC). The existing deep network is plagued by instability in finding the under-represented LN classes on highly complex WBS, where end-to-end tuned models that can account for this uncertainty region for multi-class locations are needed. Hence, as a key contribution of this study, we designed a novel leveraging segmentation network with input guidance (LSIG) end-to-end training model without pre and post-processing features that can learn ideal parameter settings depending on the quantity of multiple-object instances. To improve the co-occurrence of classes and control the false positive regions, we proposed a re-weighting negative control (RNC) mechanism that combines two key components, namely the re-weighting (Rw) term and the negative control function (NcF). This unified approximation of weighted training would leverage the network to control and learn the desired weights of true positives towards the LN region. As an end-to-end network training, we utilize a Unet-like convolution neural network (CNN) model. The performance of the LSIG is compared with the CNN-based networks, based on the ground truth (GT) mask developed using post-ablation single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT/CT). Furthermore, the effectiveness of the two components used in the LSIG framework is evaluated on WBS datasets.

Question: Given [Peripheral blood intermediate monocyte protease-activated receptor-2 expression increases during asthma exacerbations and after inhalation allergen challenge. Background: Myeloid cells, especially dendritic cells and macrophages, play important roles in asthma pathophysiology. Monocytes (Mo) and macrophages express protease-activated receptor-2 (PAR-2), a proinflammatory serine protease receptor implicated in the pathophysiology of allergic airway inflammation. We have revealed that patients with severe asthma and those with a history of frequent asthma exacerbations exhibit increased PAR-2 expression on peripheral blood monocytes. Objective: To determine PAR-2 expression on peripheral blood intermediate monocytes (IMMo) in subjects with increased airway inflammation, either as a result of an asthma exacerbation or after an inhalation allergen challenge. Methods: A total of 16 adults who presented to the emergency department with asthma exacerbations were recruited after giving an informed consent. After 2 weeks, 10 patients returned for follow-up. A total of 11 patients with mild asthma treated only with as-needed bronchodilators were recruited and underwent inhalation allergen challenge after providing an informed consent. Immune cell profiling was performed by whole blood flow cytometry in both groups of patients. Results: PAR-2 expression in peripheral blood IMMo increased in patients with an asthma exacerbation compared with those with stable disease, but this expression decreased after treatment of the asthma exacerbation. Subjects with mild asthma had an increase in percentages of IMMo expressing PAR-2 after an allergen challenge. Patients who presented to the emergency department had lower dendritic cell and dendritic cell subset numbers in peripheral blood during exacerbation compared with after treatment.

Question: Given [Pevonedistat Suppresses Pancreatic Cancer Growth via Inactivation of the Neddylation Pathway. Background: The neddylation pathway is aberrantly overactivated in multiple human cancers and has been indicated as an effective target for anticancer therapy in clinical trials. We aimed to study whether the neddylation pathway is upregulated in pancreatic cancer and whether pevonedistat, a first-in-class anticancer agent specifically targeting this pathway, will suppress cancer tumorigenesis and progression. Methods: We evaluated the expression pattern of neddylation pathway components in 179 pancreatic adenocarcinoma (PAAD) compared with 171 normal tissues from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) dataset and further assessed PAAD patient prognosis with high neddylation pathway expression via Gene Expression Profiling Interactive Analysis (GEPIA). We then analyzed malignant cancer phenotypes both in vitro and in vivo, as well as intrinsic molecular mechanisms upon pevonedistat treatment. Results: We found that the neddylation pathway was hyperactivated in pancreatic cancer. Patients with high neddylation pathway expression exhibited worse prognoses. Pevonedistat significantly inhibited the cancer cell cycle, cell growth, and proliferation; increased cell apoptosis; and decreased cancer cell xenografts in a mouse model. Mechanistically, pevonedistat treatment and the siRNA knockdown neddylation pathway were able to remarkably induce the accumulation of Wee1, p27, and p21. Further mechanistic studies revealed that pevonedistat mainly impaired the ubiquitination level and delayed the protein degradation of Wee1, p27, and p21. Conclusions: Our results showed that pevonedistat targeted the overexpression of the neddylation pathway in pancreatic cancer to induce cell growth suppression by inducing the accumulation of the cell cycle regulators Wee1, p27, and p21, which provides sound evidence for the clinical trial of pevonedistat for pancreatic cancer therapy.] you can assume that [Pevonedistat is an effective and safe option for pancreatic cancer therapy.].

Question: Given [Protective efficacy of the peptide Subolesin antigen against the cattle tick Rhipicephalus microplus under natural infestation. The cattle tick Rhipicephalus microplus affect animal health, welfare, and cattle production in tropical and subtropical zones of the world. Anti-tick vaccines have been an effective alternative for cattle tick control instead of traditional chemical products. To date, Subolesin antigen has shown efficacy for the control of tick infestation in cattle, and previous studies showed that one peptide derived from this protein has demonstrated to elicit a strong and specific humoral immune response. Based on these findings, herein we characterized the efficacy of the peptide Subolesin for the control of cattle tick, R. microplus infestation under field conditions. Twenty-four female calves were assigned to four experimental groups and immunized with three subcutaneous doses of the peptide Subolesin, Bm86, both antigens (dual vaccine) and adjuvant/saline alone, respectively. Serum antibody levels (IgG) were assessed by ELISA and confirmed by Western blot; also, reproductive performance of naturally infested R. microplus was determined. The results showed that immunizations with the experimental antigens reduced tick infestations with vaccine's efficacy of 67 % (peptide Subolesin), 56 % (Bm86), and 49 % (dual vaccine) based on adult tick numbers, oviposition, and egg fertility between vaccinated and control animals. Peptide Subolesin-immunized calves developed a strong humoral immune response expressed by high anti-pSubolesin IgG levels, and the Western blot analysis confirmed that it is immunogenic. Cattle receiving Bm86 and dual vaccine showed less protection, although Bm86 was within the range reported previously. The negative correlation between antibody levels and reduction of naturally infested R. microplus strongly suggested that the effect of the vaccine was the result of the antibody response in immunized cattle. In conclusion, it was demonstrated that the peptide Subolesin induced a specific immune response in cattle under field conditions, resulting in reduced R. microplus populations in subsequent generations.

To study the demographic characteristics (age, parity), risk factors, treatment modalities, and pregnancy outcomes in women with thrombotic microangiopathy in Ain Shams University Maternity Hospital over a 5-year period. Patients and methods. This study was retrospectively conducted at Ain Shams University Maternity Hospital and included 419 patients; the study population were pregnant women admitted to the hospital from January 2014 to December 2018, with pregnancy-associated thrombotic microangiopathy. The study was performed through revising the medical records in the archive and the ICU and contacting the patients to assess demographic data, risk factors, presentation of the patient, type of the syndrome, and the maternal and fetal outcome. Results. HELLP syndrome was the most common pregnancy complication. In most of cases, women delivered by cesarean section (72.1%). Complications included chronic hypertension (CHTN), acute kidney injury (AKI), chronic kidney injury (CKI). Maternal mortality was significantly more frequent in hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS). Maternal mortality was 8.8 %, and neonatal mortality was 26.7%. Most of women were admitted to the ICU (87.1%). Conclusion. Thrombotic microangiopathy in pregnancy continues to pose a large challenge to obstetricians, immunologists, and nephrologists due to potential risks and complications.

Question: Given [Pharmacokinetic/Pharmacodynamic Dosage Individualization of Suppressive Beta-Lactam Therapy Administered by Subcutaneous Route in Patients With Prosthetic Joint Infection. Suppressive parenteral antibiotic therapy with beta-lactams may be necessary in patients with Gram-negative bone and joint infection (BJI). Subcutaneous drug administration can facilitate this therapy in outpatient setting, but there is limited information about this practice. We have developed an original approach for drug dosing in this context, based on therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) and pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) principles. The objective of this study was to describe our approach and its first results in a case series. We analyzed data from patients who received suppressive antibiotic therapy by subcutaneous (SC) route with beta-lactams as salvage therapy for prosthetic joint infection (PJI) and had TDM with PK/PD-based dose adjustment. Ten patients (six women and four men with a mean age of 77 years) were included from January 2017 to May 2020. The drugs administered by SC route were ceftazidime (n = 4), ertapenem (n = 4), and ceftriaxone (n = 2). In each patient, PK/PD-guided dosage individualization was performed based on TDM and minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) measurements. The dose interval could be prolonged from twice daily to thrice weekly in some patients, while preserving the achievement of PK/PD targets. The infection was totally controlled by the strategy in nine out the 10 patients during a median follow-up of 1,035 days (~3 years). No patient acquired carbapenem-resistant Gram-negative bacteria during the follow-up. One patient presented treatment failure with acquired drug resistance under therapy, which could be explained by late MIC determination and insufficient exposure, retrospectively. To conclude, our innovative approach, based on model-based TDM, MIC determination, and individualized PK/PD goals, facilitates, and optimizes suppressive outpatient beta-lactam therapy administered by SC route for PJI.

This is the first detailed analysis conducted to elucidate the prevalence, clinicopathological profile, and response to different immunosuppressives in children with C1qN in India. Materials and Methods: Detailed demographic profile, clinical features, urine and blood chemistries, kidney biopsy, and response to different immunosuppressives of the study participants were analyzed between August 2015 and October 2020 for steroid-dependent/-resistant nephrotic syndrome (NS). Results: C1qN was diagnosed in 16 (14.13%) of 113 children who underwent biopsy for steroid-dependent/-resistant NS. The mean age was 44 months (range 18-99 months) and male and female number was 12 (75%) and four (25%), respectively, and mean follow-up was 3.5 years. Eight (50%) had coexistent minimal-change nephrotic syndrome (MCNS) pattern, seven (43.7%) had focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS), and one (6.2%) had diffuse mesangial hypercellularity. Thirteen children had complete follow-up, of which eight (61.5%) and four (30.7%) cases presented as steroid-dependent and primary steroid-resistant NS, respectively, whereas one (7.6%) had joint pain with rashes. At presentation, seven (53.8%) had hypertension, 12 (92.3%) had nephrotic range proteinuria, and six cases (46.1%) had hematuria. Nine (75%) of 12 cases achieved complete remission with calcineurin inhibitor (CNI) therapy, and two were non responders, one was a partial responder, and one responded to mycophenolate. Of six FSGS cases, four had complete remission, one had partial remission, and one was in non-remission. Of six cases with MCNS, five had complete remission and one was in non-remission. Renal functions remained normal in all except one case who had progression to chronic kidney disease Stage 3. Conclusion: One out of seven children with difficult NS can have underlying C1qN. CNIs are most beneficial to attain and maintain remission. Renal functions remain normal in the majority.

Question: Given [C1q nephropathy in children with nephrotic syndrome: Treatment strategies and outcomes. Introduction: There is a paucity of clinical data on C1q nephropathy (C1qN) in children in India and Southeast Asia. This is the first detailed analysis conducted to elucidate the prevalence, clinicopathological profile, and response to different immunosuppressives in children with C1qN in India. Materials and Methods: Detailed demographic profile, clinical features, urine and blood chemistries, kidney biopsy, and response to different immunosuppressives of the study participants were analyzed between August 2015 and October 2020 for steroid-dependent/-resistant nephrotic syndrome (NS). Results: C1qN was diagnosed in 16 (14.13%) of 113 children who underwent biopsy for steroid-dependent/-resistant NS. The mean age was 44 months (range 18-99 months) and male and female number was 12 (75%) and four (25%), respectively, and mean follow-up was 3.5 years. Eight (50%) had coexistent minimal-change nephrotic syndrome (MCNS) pattern, seven (43.7%) had focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS), and one (6.2%) had diffuse mesangial hypercellularity. Thirteen children had complete follow-up, of which eight (61.5%) and four (30.7%) cases presented as steroid-dependent and primary steroid-resistant NS, respectively, whereas one (7.6%) had joint pain with rashes. At presentation, seven (53.8%) had hypertension, 12 (92.3%) had nephrotic range proteinuria, and six cases (46.1%) had hematuria. Nine (75%) of 12 cases achieved complete remission with calcineurin inhibitor (CNI) therapy, and two were non responders, one was a partial responder, and one responded to mycophenolate. Of six FSGS cases, four had complete remission, one had partial remission, and one was in non-remission. Of six cases with MCNS, five had complete remission and one was in non-remission. Renal functions remained normal in all except one case who had progression to chronic kidney disease Stage 3. Conclusion: One out of seven children with difficult NS can have underlying C1qN. CNIs are most beneficial to attain and maintain remission. Renal functions remain normal in the majority. Along with C1q deposits, MCNS and FSGS patterns are seen equally and respond almost similarly to CNIs.

Question: Given [Pharmacokinetics and Tissue Distribution of Oxidized and Reduced Coenzyme Q10 Upon Intravenous Administration. Drugs containing coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10) in the oxidized (ubiquinone) or reduced forms (ubiquinol) are used to treat diseases associated with redox imbalance and are intended only for peroral administration. Parenteral solubilized forms of CoQ10 could fully reveal its therapeutic potential because of its low bioavailability. This study was aimed at comparing the pharmacokinetics and tissue distribution of CoQ10 upon intravenous administration of new dosage forms of ubiquinone and ubiquinol. Preparations (1% aqueous solutions with similar excipient compositions) were administered intravenously to rats (single dose, 30 mg/kg).

Question: Given [A Multimetric Evaluation of Online Patient Educational Materials for Breast Implant-associated Anaplastic Large Cell Lymphoma. Objective: To assess understandability, actionability, and readability of online patient educational materials (OPEM) related to breast implant-associated anaplastic large cell lymphoma (BIA-ALCL). Methods: Search volumes for query terms related to BIA-ALCL including "breast implant associated lymphoma,""breast implant associated anaplastic large cell lymphoma,"and "BIA-ALCL"were analyzed in one-week increments and normalized to total Google search volume. The same terms were then queried using an online search engine to identify commonly accessed OPEM on this topic. Understandability and actionability of OPEM were evaluated using the Patient Education Materials Assessment Tool. Grade-level readability was determined using generalized estimating equations, with observations nested within readability metrics from each website. All interval estimates were calculated for 95% confidence. Results: Overall, 24 websites were identified based on search parameters. Of these websites, 11 (45.8%) met criteria for understandability, and 1 (4.2%) met criteria for actionability. Overall, readability ranged from 10.2 to 17.3 for all websites with an average grade level readability of 12.4; 0 websites were written at or below a sixth-grade reading level. Government websites had the highest average grade reading level at 14.0, followed by commercial websites at 13.2, nonprofit websites at 12.0, and then academic/hospital-based websites at 11.5.

Question: Given [Pharmacokinetics and Toxicokinetics of Artemisinin-Hydroxychloroquine Sulfate Tablets in Rats and Dogs. Artemisinin-hydroxychloroquine sulfate tablets (AH) are relatively inexpensive and a novel combination therapy for the treatment of all forms of malaria, especially aminoquinine drug-resistant strains of P. falciparum. Our aim was to assess the pharmacokinetics (PK) and toxicokinetics (TK) of AH following oral administration in Sprague Dawley rats and Beagle dogs by using the liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry methods (LC-MS/MS). The PK studies were carried out in eighteen rats at three doses and six dogs at three rounds of three doses after a single oral administration of AH. The TK studies in rats and dogs were accompanied by the 14-day repeated dosing studies. The PK results revealed that artemisinin was absorbed and cleared rapidly in rats with obvious gender difference and interindividual variability, and the systemic exposure with regard to AUC was positively correlated with the dosage in female rats. However, the kinetics parameters of artemisinin in dogs were not obtained because the plasma concentration was undetectable. The absorption and elimination of hydroxychloroquine in dogs and rats were relatively slow, and no gender difference was observed. The AUC of hydroxychloroquine showed a linear correlation with the dosage, but Cmax varied significantly among individuals. After 14-day repeated oral administration of AH, hydroxychloroquine shows an increase in systemic exposure and accumulation in rats and dogs, whereas the AUC and Cmax of artemisinin remarkably decreased in female rats due to its autoinduction metabolism. The TK results were basically consistent with the dose- and time-dependent toxic reaction in 14-day repeated dosing studies of AH in rats and dogs. The information from our studies could be helpful for further pharmacological and toxicological research and clinical application of AH.

Question: Given [Inulin Fermentable Fiber Ameliorates Type I Diabetes via IL22 and Short-Chain Fatty Acids in Experimental Models. Background & Aims: Nourishment of gut microbiota via consumption of fermentable fiber promotes gut health and guards against metabolic syndrome. In contrast, how dietary fiber impacts type 1 diabetes is less clear. Methods: To examine impact of dietary fibers on development of type 1 diabetes in the streptozotocin (STZ)-induced and spontaneous non-obese diabetes (NOD) models, mice were fed grain-based chow (GBC) or compositionally defined diets enriched with a fermentable fiber (inulin) or an insoluble fiber (cellulose). Spontaneous (NOD mice) or STZ-induced (wild-type mice) diabetes was monitored. Results: Relative to GBC, low-fiber diets exacerbated STZ-induced diabetes, whereas diets enriched with inulin, but not cellulose, strongly protected against or treated it. Inulin's restoration of glycemic control prevented loss of adipose depots, while reducing food and water consumption. Inulin normalized pancreatic function and markedly enhanced insulin sensitivity. Such amelioration of diabetes was associated with alterations in gut microbiota composition and was eliminated by antibiotic administration. Pharmacologic blockade of fermentation reduced inulin's beneficial impact on glycemic control, indicating a role for short-chain fatty acids (SCFA). Furthermore, inulin's microbiota-dependent anti-diabetic effect associated with SCFA-independent restoration of interleukin 22, which was necessary and sufficient to ameliorate STZ-induced diabetes.

The use of the BRAF inhibitor vemurafenib exhibits drug resistance in the treatment of thyroid cancer (TC), and finding more effective multitarget combination therapies may be an important solution. In the present study, we found strong correlations between Ref-1 high expression and BRAF mutation, lymph node metastasis, and TNM stage. The oxidative stress environment induced by structural activation of BRAF upregulates the expression of Ref-1, which caused intrinsic resistance of PTC to vemurafenib. Combination inhibition of the Ref-1 redox function and BRAF could enhance the antitumor effects of vemurafenib, which was achieved by blocking the action of Ref-1 on BRAF proteins. Furthermore, combination treatment could cause an overload of autophagic flux via excessive AMPK protein activation, causing cell senescence and cell death in vitro. And combined administration of Ref-1 and vemurafenib in vivo suppressed PTC cell growth and metastasis in a cell-based lung metastatic tumor model and xenogeneic subcutaneous tumor model.

Question: Given [Levodopa Challenge Test Predicts STN-DBS Outcomes in Various Parkinson's Disease Motor Subtypes: A More Accurate Judgment. Background. The relationship between the levodopa challenge test (LDCT) and postoperative subthalamic nucleus-deep brain stimulation (STN-DBS) benefits is controversial in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD). We aim to evaluate the value of total levodopa response (TLR) and symptom levodopa response (SLR) in predicting postoperative improvement in different PD motor subtypes. Methods. Studies were split into a training set (147 patients) and a validation set (304 patients). We retrospectively collected data from 147 patients who received the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale- (UPDRS-) III and the Parkinson's Disease Questionnaire- (PDQ-) 39 evaluation. Patients were classified into tremor-dominant (TD), akinetic-rigid-dominant (AR), and mixed (MX) groups. Clinically important difference (CID) was employed to dichotomize DBS effects. For patients in each subtype group from the training set, we used the correlation and receiver operator characteristic (ROC) curve analyses to explore the strength of their relations. Areas under the curve (AUCs) were calculated and compared through the DeLong test. Results developed from the training set were applied into the validation set to predict postoperative improvement in different PD motor subtypes. Results. In the validation cohort, TLR significantly correlated with postoperative motor (p<0.001) and quality of life (QOL) (p<0.001) improvement in the MX group. The AUC between TLR and UPDRS-III (TU) is 0.800. The AUC between TLR and PDQ-39 (TP) is 0.770. An associated criterion in both TU and TP is around 50%. In the AR group, strong correlation was only found in SLR and PDQ-39 (SP) (p<0.001). And the AUC of SP is significantly larger than that in TLR and PDQ-39 (TP) (p=0.034). An associated criterion in SP is around 37%. No significant correlation was found in the TD group. Conclusions. We provide a more accurate judgment for LDCT. TLR strongly correlated with postoperative UPDRS-III and PDQ-39 improvement in MX patients. A TLR>50% may indicate a higher possibility of clinically meaningful benefits from STN-DBS comparing to medication only. SLR can well predict QOL improvement in AR patients. Similarly, a SLR>37% may indicate a higher possibility of clinically significant benefits from STN-DBS. LDCT provides limited information for TD patients.

Question: Given [Phenethyl Isothiocyanate Enhances the Cytotoxic Effects of PARP Inhibitors in High-Grade Serous Ovarian Cancer Cells. While PARP inhibitor (PARPi) therapies have shown promising results in the treatment of high-grade serous ovarian cancer (HGSOC) harboring homologous recombination deficiencies, primary resistance to PARPi frequently occurs and even initial responders may eventually become resistant. Therefore, the development of novel effective combinatorial strategies to treat HGSOC is urgently needed. Here, we report that H2O2-induced oxidative stress sensitized HGSOC cells to PARPi BMN 673. Furthermore, Phenethyl isothiocyanate (PEITC) as a ROS-inducing agent significantly enhanced the cytotoxic effects of BMN 673. Mechanistically, combined use of PEITC and BMN 673 resulted in ROS overproduction and accumulation, enhanced DNA damage, G2/M arrest and apoptosis, all of which were significantly reversed by the ROS scavenger N-Acetyl-L-cysteine. We also showed that while PEITC did not further enhance the ability of BMN 673 on PARP1 trapping in HGSOC cells, the therapeutic effects of the PEITC/BMN 673 combination were at least in part dependent on the presence of PARP1. Importantly, the PEITC/BMN 673 combination potently abrogated the growth of HGSOC tumor spheroids and patient-derived organoid models of HGSOC and cervical cancer. Our findings provide a basis for further investigation of the utility of PARPi combination regimen in HGSOC and cervical cancer through ROS-mediated mechanisms.] you can assume that [Phenethyl isothiocyanate enhances the cytotoxic effects of PARP inhibitors in high-grade serous ovarian cancer patients.].

Patients were classified into tremor-dominant (TD), akinetic-rigid-dominant (AR), and mixed (MX) groups. Clinically important difference (CID) was employed to dichotomize DBS effects. For patients in each subtype group from the training set, we used the correlation and receiver operator characteristic (ROC) curve analyses to explore the strength of their relations. Areas under the curve (AUCs) were calculated and compared through the DeLong test. Results developed from the training set were applied into the validation set to predict postoperative improvement in different PD motor subtypes. Results. In the validation cohort, TLR significantly correlated with postoperative motor (p<0.001) and quality of life (QOL) (p<0.001) improvement in the MX group. The AUC between TLR and UPDRS-III (TU) is 0.800. The AUC between TLR and PDQ-39 (TP) is 0.770. An associated criterion in both TU and TP is around 50%. In the AR group, strong correlation was only found in SLR and PDQ-39 (SP) (p<0.001). And the AUC of SP is significantly larger than that in TLR and PDQ-39 (TP) (p=0.034). An associated criterion in SP is around 37%. No significant correlation was found in the TD group. Conclusions. We provide a more accurate judgment for LDCT. TLR strongly correlated with postoperative UPDRS-III and PDQ-39 improvement in MX patients. A TLR>50% may indicate a higher possibility of clinically meaningful benefits from STN-DBS comparing to medication only. SLR can well predict QOL improvement in AR patients. Similarly, a SLR>37% may indicate a higher possibility of clinically significant benefits from STN-DBS. LDCT provides limited information for TD patients.

Question: Given [Phenethyl Isothiocyanate Enhances the Cytotoxic Effects of PARP Inhibitors in High-Grade Serous Ovarian Cancer Cells. While PARP inhibitor (PARPi) therapies have shown promising results in the treatment of high-grade serous ovarian cancer (HGSOC) harboring homologous recombination deficiencies, primary resistance to PARPi frequently occurs and even initial responders may eventually become resistant. Therefore, the development of novel effective combinatorial strategies to treat HGSOC is urgently needed. Here, we report that H2O2-induced oxidative stress sensitized HGSOC cells to PARPi BMN 673. Furthermore, Phenethyl isothiocyanate (PEITC) as a ROS-inducing agent significantly enhanced the cytotoxic effects of BMN 673. Mechanistically, combined use of PEITC and BMN 673 resulted in ROS overproduction and accumulation, enhanced DNA damage, G2/M arrest and apoptosis, all of which were significantly reversed by the ROS scavenger N-Acetyl-L-cysteine. We also showed that while PEITC did not further enhance the ability of BMN 673 on PARP1 trapping in HGSOC cells, the therapeutic effects of the PEITC/BMN 673 combination were at least in part dependent on the presence of PARP1. Importantly, the PEITC/BMN 673 combination potently abrogated the growth of HGSOC tumor spheroids and patient-derived organoid models of HGSOC and cervical cancer. Our findings provide a basis for further investigation of the utility of PARPi combination regimen in HGSOC and cervical cancer through ROS-mediated mechanisms.] you can infer that [Phenethyl isothiocyanate enhances the cytotoxic effects of PARP inhibitors in high-grade serous ovarian cancer patients.].

Question: Given [Levodopa Challenge Test Predicts STN-DBS Outcomes in Various Parkinson's Disease Motor Subtypes: A More Accurate Judgment. Background. The relationship between the levodopa challenge test (LDCT) and postoperative subthalamic nucleus-deep brain stimulation (STN-DBS) benefits is controversial in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD).

Question: Given [Pimavanserin Promotes Trophic Factor Release and Protects Cultured Primary Dopaminergic Neurons Exposed to MPP+ in a GDNF-Dependent Manner. Neurodegeneration and impaired neural development are a common feature of many neuropsychiatric disorders. Second-generation antipsychotics (SGAs) and certain atypical antidepressants display neuroprotective effects. Though these drugs interact with many molecular targets, a common shared attribute is high antagonist potency at 5-HT2A receptors. Pimavanserin is a selective 5-HT2A inverse agonist/antagonist that was recently FDA approved for treating hallucinations and delusions associated with Parkinson's disease. Unlike SGAs, pimavanserin lacks activity at other targets like dopamine, histamine, muscarinic, and adrenergic receptors. To investigate whether selective 5-HT2A inverse agonists have neuroprotective properties, pimavanserin and another selective 5-HT2A inverse agonist, M100907, were applied to primary cultures of dopaminergic neurons treated with 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium (MPP+). Both pimavanserin and M100907 protected dopaminergic neurons against MPP+-induced cell death. The neuroprotective effects of pimavanserin required signaling through the extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 pathway, restored mitochondrial function, and reduced oxidative stress. Further investigation showed that pimavanserin promotes the release of brain-derived neurotrophic factor and glial-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) and that the neuroprotective effects of pimavanserin were blocked by antibodies to GDNF but not by anti-tyrosine receptor kinase B receptor antibodies. Thus, pimavanserin induces release of neurotrophic factors and protects dopaminergic neurons against MPP+ toxicity in a GDNF-dependent manner.

Question: Given [A 7-year-old boy and a 14-year-old girl initially diagnosed with toxic shock syndrome and tested positive for sars-cov-2 infection, supporting a diagnosis of multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (Mis-c). Background: Multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) has recently been described in children infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). This report describes 2 children with MIS-C who were initially diagnosed with toxic shock syndrome but who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection on reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction, supporting the diagnosis of MIS-C. Case Reports: Case 1. A 7-year-old boy with fever, cough, and dyspnea was treated with oxygen, intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) infusion, and methylprednisolone and showed a worsening of clinical conditions, persistent fever, hypotension, and hematological parameters compatible with macrophage activation syndrome (MAS). Three intravenous boluses of methylprednisolone (30 mg/kg/day) were followed by a progressive resolution. Case 2. A 14-year-old girl with syncope, fever, diarrhea, oliguria, and increased creatinine levels required fluid infusion and correction of electrolyte imbalance. The increase of creatine phosphokinase (CPK), myoglobin, troponin, and creatine kinase-MB (CK-MB) was associated with grade I atrioventricular block and pericardial effusion. The patient showed myositis and severe muscular weakness, with hematological parameters compatible with MIS-C. She started IVIG and 3 intravenous boluses of methylprednisolone. However, bradycardia, tachypnea, severe hypotension, loss of consciousness, oliguria, bilateral ground-glass pneumonia, bilateral pleural, and peritoneal effusion, in the absence of thromboembolism, required treatment with furosemide, albumin, and enoxaparin, and was followed by a prompt resolution.

Question: Given [Corticosteroid and immunosuppressant therapy for cardiac sarcoidosis: A systematic review. BACKGROUND: Corticosteroid therapy for the treatment of clinically manifest cardiac sarcoidosis is generally recommended. Our group previously systematically reviewed the data in 2013; since then, there has been increasing quality and quantity of data and also interest in nonsteroid agents. METHODS AND RESULTS: Studies were identified from MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane Controlled Trials Register, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, and the National Institutes of Health Clini calTr ials.gov database. The quality of included articles was rated using Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network 50. Outcomes examined were atrioventricular conduction, left ventricular function, ventricular arrhythmias, and mortality. A total of 3527 references were retrieved, and 34 publications met the inclusion criteria. There were no randomized trials, and only 2 studies were rated good quality. In the 34 reports (total of 1297 patients), 1125 patients received corticosteroids, 235 received additional or other immunosuppressant therapy, and 97 patients received no therapy. There were 178 patients treated for atrioventricular conduction disease, with 76/178 (42.7%) improving. In contrast, 21 patients were not treated with corticosteroids and/or immunosuppressant therapy, and none of them improved. Therapy was associated with the prevention of deterioration in left ventricular function. A total of 8 publications reported on ventricular arrhythmia burden, and 19 reported on mortality; the data quality was too limited to draw conclusions for the latter 2 outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: The best quality data relate to atrioventricular nodal conduction and left ventricular function recovery. In both situations, therapy with corticosteroids and/or immunosuppressant therapy were sometimes associated with positive outcomes.

Aim: The aim of this study was to conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis to find the prevalence of PI-IBS following Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI). Methods: We systematically searched Medline, Embase, and Web of Science from inception through January 20, 2020 for cohort studies assessing PI-IBS following CDI. Primary outcome was pooled prevalence calculated using inverse variance heterogeneity model [MetaXL (v. 5.3)]. A priori subgroup analyses were done [by irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) diagnostic criteria-Rome vs. others, time of IBS diagnosis-<6 or >6 mo, exclusion or inclusion of pre-existing IBS and CDI treatment-antibiotic with fecal microbiota transplantation vs. antibiotic only]. Heterogeneity was considered substantial if I 2>50%. Results: From 2007 to 2019, 15 studies were included (10 prospective, 5 retrospective; 9 full-text, 6 abstracts). Data from 1218 patients were included in the quantitative analysis. Risk of bias was low in 7, medium in 4 and high in 4 studies. Pooled prevalence of PI-IBS was 21.1% (95% confidence interval, 8.2%-35.7%), I 2=96%. Common PI-IBS subtypes were diarrhea-predominant in 46.3% (50) patients, and mixed in 33.3% (36) patients. Subgroup analyses by IBS diagnostic criteria, time of IBS diagnosis or CDI treatment did not significantly change the primary outcome (all P>0.05), nor decrease heterogeneity. Funnel plot analysis revealed publication bias. Conclusions: Over 20% of patients develop PI-IBS after CDI. Factors such as diagnostic criteria for IBS and CDI treatment did not affect prevalence, though small numbers limit the confidence in these conclusions. Larger, well conducted studies are needed to study PI-IBS in CDI.

Question: Given [Corticosteroid and immunosuppressant therapy for cardiac sarcoidosis: A systematic review. BACKGROUND: Corticosteroid therapy for the treatment of clinically manifest cardiac sarcoidosis is generally recommended. Our group previously systematically reviewed the data in 2013; since then, there has been increasing quality and quantity of data and also interest in nonsteroid agents. METHODS AND RESULTS: Studies were identified from MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane Controlled Trials Register, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, and the National Institutes of Health Clini calTr ials.gov database. The quality of included articles was rated using Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network 50. Outcomes examined were atrioventricular conduction, left ventricular function, ventricular arrhythmias, and mortality. A total of 3527 references were retrieved, and 34 publications met the inclusion criteria. There were no randomized trials, and only 2 studies were rated good quality. In the 34 reports (total of 1297 patients), 1125 patients received corticosteroids, 235 received additional or other immunosuppressant therapy, and 97 patients received no therapy. There were 178 patients treated for atrioventricular conduction disease, with 76/178 (42.7%) improving. In contrast, 21 patients were not treated with corticosteroids and/or immunosuppressant therapy, and none of them improved. Therapy was associated with the prevention of deterioration in left ventricular function.

Question: Given [A Multimetric Evaluation of Online Patient Educational Materials for Breast Implant-associated Anaplastic Large Cell Lymphoma. Objective: To assess understandability, actionability, and readability of online patient educational materials (OPEM) related to breast implant-associated anaplastic large cell lymphoma (BIA-ALCL). Methods: Search volumes for query terms related to BIA-ALCL including "breast implant associated lymphoma,""breast implant associated anaplastic large cell lymphoma,"and "BIA-ALCL"were analyzed in one-week increments and normalized to total Google search volume. The same terms were then queried using an online search engine to identify commonly accessed OPEM on this topic. Understandability and actionability of OPEM were evaluated using the Patient Education Materials Assessment Tool. Grade-level readability was determined using generalized estimating equations, with observations nested within readability metrics from each website. All interval estimates were calculated for 95% confidence. Results: Overall, 24 websites were identified based on search parameters. Of these websites, 11 (45.8%) met criteria for understandability, and 1 (4.2%) met criteria for actionability. Overall, readability ranged from 10.2 to 17.3 for all websites with an average grade level readability of 12.4; 0 websites were written at or below a sixth-grade reading level. Government websites had the highest average grade reading level at 14.0, followed by commercial websites at 13.2, nonprofit websites at 12.0, and then academic/hospital-based websites at 11.5. Conclusion: The quality of available OPEM on BIA-ALCL is limited. Future development of OPEM should be designed with the goal of improving both comprehension and actionability to help reduce patient anxiety and unnecessary clinical appointments related to this disease.

Question: Given [Potential for Increasing Uptake of Radiolabeled 68Ga-DOTATOC and 123I-MIBG in Patients with Midgut Neuroendocrine Tumors Using a Histone Deacetylase Inhibitor Vorinostat. Background: Histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors have been shown in preclinical studies to upregulate norepinephrine transporters in neuroblastoma and pheochromocytoma, and somatostatin receptors in pulmonary carcinoid, small cell lung cancer, and pancreatic neuroendocrine malignancies. This pilot imaging study in humans focuses on midgut neuroendocrine carcinoma metastatic to the liver, evaluating the effect of pretreatment with the HDAC inhibitor vorinostat on uptake of 123I-MIBG and 68Ga-DOTATOC. Materials and Methods: Multiple midgut neuroendocrine liver metastases in clinically stable subjects were imaged with 123I-MIBG and 68Ga-DOTATOC before and after a 4-d course of vorinostat. Scans were performed with strict attention to detail and timed about 1 month apart occurring just before monthly long-acting octreotide administrations. Uptake changes in tumor and normal liver parenchyma were assessed on positron emission computed tomography (PET/CT) with standardized uptake values and on single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) with qualitative ratio images. Results: The experimental units were metastatic liver lesions within patients (n = 50). There was no significant difference in administered activity or uptake time between pairs of scans for either radiotracer. Statistically significant increase in maximum standardized uptake values (SUVmax) averaged over all lesions was noted on the 68Ga-DOTATOC PET scans (+11%, p < 0.01). SUVmax in normal liver showed no significant change (p = 0.12). There was no qualitative change in uptake of 123I-MIBG after vorinostat. Conclusions: In this pilot imaging study in patients with midgut neuroendocrine liver metastases, a short course of the HDAC inhibitor vorinostat induced a statistically significant increase in SUVmax on 68Ga-DOTATOC PET/computed tomography (CT) imaging in some hepatic neuroendocrine tumor metastases. There was no significant effect of vorinostat on tumor uptake of 123I-MIBG on SPECT/CT imaging. Given the pilot nature of this trial, the findings merit further investigation with a more rigorous protocol evaluating longer pretreatment and different dosages of vorinostat or other HDAC inhibitors, as well as effects on the therapeutic capability of 177Lu- or 90Y-somatostatin analogs.

Question: Given [A 7-year-old boy and a 14-year-old girl initially diagnosed with toxic shock syndrome and tested positive for sars-cov-2 infection, supporting a diagnosis of multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (Mis-c). Background: Multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) has recently been described in children infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). This report describes 2 children with MIS-C who were initially diagnosed with toxic shock syndrome but who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection on reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction, supporting the diagnosis of MIS-C. Case Reports: Case 1. A 7-year-old boy with fever, cough, and dyspnea was treated with oxygen, intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) infusion, and methylprednisolone and showed a worsening of clinical conditions, persistent fever, hypotension, and hematological parameters compatible with macrophage activation syndrome (MAS). Three intravenous boluses of methylprednisolone (30 mg/kg/day) were followed by a progressive resolution. Case 2. A 14-year-old girl with syncope, fever, diarrhea, oliguria, and increased creatinine levels required fluid infusion and correction of electrolyte imbalance. The increase of creatine phosphokinase (CPK), myoglobin, troponin, and creatine kinase-MB (CK-MB) was associated with grade I atrioventricular block and pericardial effusion. The patient showed myositis and severe muscular weakness, with hematological parameters compatible with MIS-C. She started IVIG and 3 intravenous boluses of methylprednisolone. However, bradycardia, tachypnea, severe hypotension, loss of consciousness, oliguria, bilateral ground-glass pneumonia, bilateral pleural, and peritoneal effusion, in the absence of thromboembolism, required treatment with furosemide, albumin, and enoxaparin, and was followed by a prompt resolution. Conclusions: These 2 pediatric cases highlight the importance of SARS-CoV-2 testing in all patients with acute symptoms and signs of infection during the COVID-19 pandemic.

This report describes 2 children with MIS-C who were initially diagnosed with toxic shock syndrome but who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection on reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction, supporting the diagnosis of MIS-C. Case Reports: Case 1. A 7-year-old boy with fever, cough, and dyspnea was treated with oxygen, intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) infusion, and methylprednisolone and showed a worsening of clinical conditions, persistent fever, hypotension, and hematological parameters compatible with macrophage activation syndrome (MAS). Three intravenous boluses of methylprednisolone (30 mg/kg/day) were followed by a progressive resolution. Case 2. A 14-year-old girl with syncope, fever, diarrhea, oliguria, and increased creatinine levels required fluid infusion and correction of electrolyte imbalance. The increase of creatine phosphokinase (CPK), myoglobin, troponin, and creatine kinase-MB (CK-MB) was associated with grade I atrioventricular block and pericardial effusion. The patient showed myositis and severe muscular weakness, with hematological parameters compatible with MIS-C. She started IVIG and 3 intravenous boluses of methylprednisolone. However, bradycardia, tachypnea, severe hypotension, loss of consciousness, oliguria, bilateral ground-glass pneumonia, bilateral pleural, and peritoneal effusion, in the absence of thromboembolism, required treatment with furosemide, albumin, and enoxaparin, and was followed by a prompt resolution. Conclusions: These 2 pediatric cases highlight the importance of SARS-CoV-2 testing in all patients with acute symptoms and signs of infection during the COVID-19 pandemic. As new variants of SARS-CoV-2 emerge, cases of MIS-C can become more prevalent, and pediatricians should be aware of diagnostic and management guidelines.] you can imply that [Enoxaparin can be used to treat thromboembolism.].

Question: Given [Potential global impacts of alternative dosing regimen and rollout options for the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine. The high efficacy, low cost, and long shelf-life of the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine positions it well for use in in diverse socioeconomic settings. Using data from clinical trials, an individual-based model was constructed to predict its 6-month population-level impact. Probabilistic sensitivity analyses evaluated the importance of epidemiological, demographic and logistical factors on vaccine effectiveness. Rollout at various levels of availability and delivery speed, conditional on vaccine efficacy profiles (efficacy of each dose and interval between doses) were explored in representative countries. We highlight how expedient vaccine delivery to high-risk groups is critical in mitigating COVID-19 disease and mortality. In scenarios where the availability of vaccine is insufficient for high-risk groups to receive two doses, administration of a single dose of is optimal, even when vaccine efficacy after one dose is just 75% of the two doses. These findings can help inform allocation strategies particularly in areas constrained by availability.] you can imply that [Even in scenarios where the availability of vaccine is insufficient for high-risk groups, the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine should be administered in two doses.].

Question: Given [Postinfection Irritable Bowel Syndrome Following Clostridioides difficile Infection: A Systematic-review and Meta-analysis. Background: Postinfection irritable bowel syndrome (PI-IBS) affects 14% patients after acute bacterial enterocolitis. Aim: The aim of this study was to conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis to find the prevalence of PI-IBS following Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI). Methods: We systematically searched Medline, Embase, and Web of Science from inception through January 20, 2020 for cohort studies assessing PI-IBS following CDI. Primary outcome was pooled prevalence calculated using inverse variance heterogeneity model [MetaXL (v. 5.3)]. A priori subgroup analyses were done [by irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) diagnostic criteria-Rome vs. others, time of IBS diagnosis-<6 or >6 mo, exclusion or inclusion of pre-existing IBS and CDI treatment-antibiotic with fecal microbiota transplantation vs. antibiotic only]. Heterogeneity was considered substantial if I 2>50%. Results: From 2007 to 2019, 15 studies were included (10 prospective, 5 retrospective; 9 full-text, 6 abstracts). Data from 1218 patients were included in the quantitative analysis. Risk of bias was low in 7, medium in 4 and high in 4 studies. Pooled prevalence of PI-IBS was 21.1% (95% confidence interval, 8.2%-35.7%), I 2=96%. Common PI-IBS subtypes were diarrhea-predominant in 46.3% (50) patients, and mixed in 33.3% (36) patients. Subgroup analyses by IBS diagnostic criteria, time of IBS diagnosis or CDI treatment did not significantly change the primary outcome (all P>0.05), nor decrease heterogeneity. Funnel plot analysis revealed publication bias. Conclusions: Over 20% of patients develop PI-IBS after CDI. Factors such as diagnostic criteria for IBS and CDI treatment did not affect prevalence, though small numbers limit the confidence in these conclusions. Larger, well conducted studies are needed to study PI-IBS in CDI.

Question: Given [Potential of thrombospondin-1 in treatment of polycystic ovary syndrome rat model: a preliminary study. Objective: Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a common gynecological endocrine disease in reproductive women, and the endocrine levels are also affected by diseases. The aim of this study was to determine the effect of thrombospondin-1 (TSP-1) on PCOS rat model. Methods: We established the PCOS rat model, the serum hormones including TSP-1 expression were determined and morphological characteristics were investigated to evaluate the model. These above endocrine and morphological features were investigated again to evaluate the effect of TSP-1 treatment. Results: In the PCOS model group, the serum hormones change (higher luteinizing hormone, testosterone and estrogen) and decreased TSP-1 expression levels were found compared with the control group. Besides, the morphological characteristics of PCOS were also observed in the model group. After TSP-1 treatment, the higher TSP-1, ANGPT2, PDGFB and PDGFD expression levels, the lower LH and T levels, decreased vessel density as well as VEGFA and ANGPT1 expression levels were found compared with the control group, and the ovary morphological changes were also observed in the TSP-1 experimental group.

The aetiological and pathophysiological pathways remain to be clearly elucidated but are potentially related to increased choroidal vascular permeability. In this case, the subretinal fluid resolved rapidly and completely after cessation of travoprost drops, showing it to be a reversible pathology similar to prostaglandin-associated cystoid macular oedema. This uncommon association is therefore important to consider in the differential diagnosis of serous macular detachment.

Question: Given [Predictors of tyrosine kinase inhibitor adherence trajectories in patients with newly diagnosed chronic myeloid leukemia. Introduction: Although consistent use of tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) confers significant improvements in long-term survival for individuals with chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), only 70% of CML patients are adherent to TKIs. Understanding the factors that contribute to non-adherence and establishing dynamic adherence patterns in this population are essential aspects of targeted drug monitoring and intervention strategies. Methods: Newly diagnosed CML patients were identified in the MarketScan database and relevant covariate values extracted. Proportion of days covered (PDC) per 30-day interval was used to calculate adherence over a 12-month follow-up period. We conducted a latent profile analysis (LPA) on these PDC estimates to identify distinct, dynamic patterns of TKI adherence. Identified trajectories were grouped into four clinically relevant categories and predictors of membership in these categories were determined via multinomial logistic regression. Results: Four broad adherence categories were identified from the LPA: never adherent, initially non-adherent becoming adherent, initially adherent becoming non-adherent, and stable adherent. Results from the subsequent multinomial logistic regression indicated that younger age, female sex, greater monthly financial burden, fewer comorbidities, fewer concomitant medications, year of diagnosis, higher starting dose, TKI type, and a longer duration from diagnosis to treatment were significantly associated with membership in at least one of the three non-stable adherent groups. Conclusion: Select sociodemographic and clinical characteristics were found to predict membership in clinically meaningful groups of longitudinal TKI adherence. These findings could have major implications for informing personalized monitoring and intervention strategies for individuals who are likely to be non-adherent.] you can assume that [In patients with newly diagnosed chronic myeloid leukemia, tyrosine kinase inhibitor adherence trajectories can be predicted.].

Question: Given [Clustering and Erratic Movement Patterns of Syringe-Injected versus Mosquito-Inoculated Malaria Sporozoites Underlie Decreased Infectivity. Malaria vaccine candidates based on live, attenuated sporozoites have led to high levels of protection. However, their efficacy critically depends on the sporozoites' ability to reach and infect the host liver. Administration via mosquito inoculation is by far the most potent method for inducing immunity but highly impractical. Here, we observed that intradermal syringe-injected Plasmodium berghei sporozoites (syrSPZ) were 3-fold less efficient in migrating to and infecting mouse liver than mosquito-inoculated sporozoites (msqSPZ).

Question: Given [Prognostic Impact of the Combination of MGMT Methylation and TERT Promoter Mutation in Glioblastoma. Background The concept of combinational analysis between the methylation of O 6 -methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) and telomerase reverse transcriptase promoter (pTERT) mutation in glioblastoma (GBM) has been reported. The main study objective was to determine the prognosis of patients with GBM based on MGMT/pTERT classification, while the secondary objective was to estimate the temozolomide effect on the survival time of GBM with MGMT/pTERT classification. Methods A total of 50 GBM specimens were collected after tumor resection and were selected for investigating MGMT methylation and pTERT mutation. Clinical imaging and pathological characteristics were retrospectively analyzed. Patients with MGMT/pTERT classification were analyzed using survival analysis to develop the nomogram for forecasting and individual prognosis. Results All patients underwent resection (total resection: 28%, partial resection: 64%, biopsy: 8%). Thirty-two percent of all cases received adjuvant temozolomide with radiotherapy. Sixty-four percent of the case was found methylated MGMT, and 56% of the present cohort found pTERT mutation. Following combinational analysis of biomarkers, results showed that the GBMs with methylated MGMT and wild-type pTERT had a superior prognosis compared with other subtypes. Using Cox regression analysis with multivariable analysis, the extent of resection, postoperative chemoradiotherapy, MGMT/pTERT classification were associated with a favorable prognosis. Hence, a web-based nomogram was developed for deploying individual prognostication. Conclusions The interaction of MGMT methylation and pTERT mutation was confirmed for predicting prognosis.

Objective: We explored the association of prostate cryotherapy and immunomodulation with granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GMCSF) in the generation of detectable tumor-specific T- and B-cell responses in men with prostate cancer. Materials and methods: A randomized pilot study of patients assigned to either cryotherapy alone (Control group) or in combination with GMCSF (Treatment group). The impact of therapy on the development of T- and B-cell responses against tumor-related antigens was studied using enzyme-linked immune absorbent spot (ELISpot) and protein microarray panels (Sematrix) assays, respectively. Fold changes in response to treatment were calculated by normalization of post-treatment ELISpot values against the mean pre-cryoablation response. Student t tests between treatment and control groups at 4 weeks and 12 weeks across all the antigens were performed. Results: A total of 20 patients were randomized to either control or treatment arm. At 4 weeks after cryotherapy, the treatment group demonstrated an average fold change in cancer antigen-related antibodies of 2.8% above their mean baseline values, whereas controls averaged an 18% change below mean baseline (p < 0.05). At 12 weeks, antibody response in treatment group increased to 25% above baseline, while the average of control group patients remained 9% below baseline (p < 0.05). Patients in treatment group displayed, on average, higher ELISPOT readings for the 4- and 12-week times points (527 vs 481 for PSA and 748 vs 562 for PAP).

Question: Given [Comparative Analysis of the Effects of the Anti-VEGF Drug and Glucocorticoid by Injection before the End of Vitrectomy for Proliferative Diabetic Retinopathy. Objective. To explore the effects of the anti-VEGF drug and glucocorticoid by injection before the end of vitrectomy for proliferative diabetic retinopathy (PDR). Methods. Eighty PDR patients who underwent vitrectomy in our hospital (July 2020-June 2022) were selected as the research objects and randomized into group A (n = 40) and group B (n = 40) according to the order of admission. Before the end of surgery, group B was injected with glucocorticoid (triamcinolone acetonide) into the vitreous cavity, and group A was injected with anti-VEGF drug (conbercept). The ophthalmic parameters, incidence of complications, diabetes indexes, and surgical indexes of the two groups were compared. Results. The best corrected visual acuity (BCVA), central macular thickness (CMT), macular blood flow density and intraocular pressure in group A were remarkably better than those in group B (P<0.001). The incidence of complications (P<0.05) and VEG/F level (P<0.001) in group A were obviously lower than those in group B. There was no significant difference in fasting blood glucose (FBG) and surgical indexes between the two groups (P>0.05). Conclusion. Conbercept injection before the end of vitrectomy can improve the ophthalmic parameters, reduce the level of VEGF, and lower the possibility of postsurgical complications. Therefore, the low-cost and efficient anti-VEGF drug should be promoted and applied in practice.

Question: Given [Protective Effect of Keluoxin against Diabetic Nephropathy in Type 2 Diabetic Mellitus Models. Diabetic nephropathy (DN) is a chronic kidney disease that develops in patients with diabetes mellitus (DM). Renal dysfunction and persistent proteinuria are the main clinical features of DN. Podocyte injury is an important cause of persistent proteinuria and diabetic kidney disease (DKD) progression. Traditional Chinese patent medicines can improve renal function by enhancing autophagy and promoting apoptosis. Keluoxin is a Chinese patent medicine that has the effect of invigorating qi and nourishing yin, activating blood, and eliminating blood stasis. Therefore, we hypothesized that Keluoxin may have a protective effect against diabetic nephropathy in rats with type 2 DM. Rats induced with diabetes through streptozocin (STZ) injection and a high-fat and high-sugar diet were treated with Keluoxin (0.63 g/kg/day) for 8 weeks, and renal function, biochemical indicators, and histopathological changes in renal tissues were observed. Immunofluorescence staining and western blot analysis were used to detect the expression of autophagy-related proteins. The results showed that Keluoxin reduced blood glucose and lipid levels, improved renal function, and alleviated renal histopathological changes in rats with DN. The therapeutic effect was similar to that of Irbesartan (15.6 mg/kg/day). It is inferred that the mechanism works through reducing the obstruction of downstream pathways of autophagy by improving the lysosomal degradation function and alleviating podocyte injury. This study demonstrates that Keluoxin could regulate autophagy in podocytes, alleviate kidney injury in rats with DN, and have a protective effect on renal function; its mechanism can thus be a potential therapy for DN.

Question: Given [Protective efficacy of the peptide Subolesin antigen against the cattle tick Rhipicephalus microplus under natural infestation. The cattle tick Rhipicephalus microplus affect animal health, welfare, and cattle production in tropical and subtropical zones of the world. Anti-tick vaccines have been an effective alternative for cattle tick control instead of traditional chemical products. To date, Subolesin antigen has shown efficacy for the control of tick infestation in cattle, and previous studies showed that one peptide derived from this protein has demonstrated to elicit a strong and specific humoral immune response. Based on these findings, herein we characterized the efficacy of the peptide Subolesin for the control of cattle tick, R. microplus infestation under field conditions. Twenty-four female calves were assigned to four experimental groups and immunized with three subcutaneous doses of the peptide Subolesin, Bm86, both antigens (dual vaccine) and adjuvant/saline alone, respectively. Serum antibody levels (IgG) were assessed by ELISA and confirmed by Western blot; also, reproductive performance of naturally infested R. microplus was determined. The results showed that immunizations with the experimental antigens reduced tick infestations with vaccine's efficacy of 67 % (peptide Subolesin), 56 % (Bm86), and 49 % (dual vaccine) based on adult tick numbers, oviposition, and egg fertility between vaccinated and control animals. Peptide Subolesin-immunized calves developed a strong humoral immune response expressed by high anti-pSubolesin IgG levels, and the Western blot analysis confirmed that it is immunogenic. Cattle receiving Bm86 and dual vaccine showed less protection, although Bm86 was within the range reported previously. The negative correlation between antibody levels and reduction of naturally infested R. microplus strongly suggested that the effect of the vaccine was the result of the antibody response in immunized cattle. In conclusion, it was demonstrated that the peptide Subolesin induced a specific immune response in cattle under field conditions, resulting in reduced R. microplus populations in subsequent generations.

Severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) can result in pneumonia and acute respiratory failure. Accumulation of mucus in the airways is a hallmark of the disease and can result in hypoxemia. Here, we show that quantitative proteome analysis of the sputum from severe patients with COVID-19 reveal high levels of neutrophil extracellular trap (NET) components, which was confirmed by microscopy. Extracellular DNA from excessive NET formation can increase sputum viscosity and lead to acute respiratory distress syndrome. Recombinant human DNase (Pulmozyme; Roche) has been shown to be beneficial in reducing sputum viscosity and improve lung function. We treated five patients pwith COVID-19 resenting acute symptoms with clinically approved aerosolized Pulmozyme. No adverse reactions to the drug were seen, and improved oxygen saturation and recovery in all severely ill patients with COVID-19 was observed after therapy. Immunofluorescence and proteome analysis of sputum and blood plasma samples after treatment revealed a marked reduction of NETs and a set of statistically significant proteome changes that indicate reduction of hemorrhage, plasma leakage and inflammation in the airways, and reduced systemic inflammatory state in the blood plasma of patients. Taken together, the results indicate that NETs contribute to acute respiratory failure in COVID-19 and that degrading NETs may reduce dependency on external high-flow oxygen therapy in patients.

Question: Given [Protocol-based cardiotoxicity monitoring in hydroxychloroquine medicated COVID-19 pediatric patients. Introduction/objectives: By May 2020, SARS-CoV-2 had caused more than 400 000 deaths worldwide. Initially, hydroxychloroquine was a treatment option for COVID-19. More recent studies have questioned its safety and efficacy and, until stronger evidence is available, it was suspended from therapy protocols. We describe our experience treating COVID-19 Portuguese pediatric patients with hydroxychloroquine, having applied a protocol for monitoring cardiac toxicity. Methods: An observational retrospective study of COVID-19 pediatric patients, admitted from March to April 2020 and treated with hydroxychloroquine. Cardiotoxicity was assessed using ECG recordings and corrected QT-time (QTc). Patients were classified into risk-groups depending on QTc value: normal, slightly elevated or severely elevated (>500 ms). Results: Total of 14 patients, with a median age of 10 years [four months; 17 years], treated with hydroxychloroquine for a median of five days. Hydroxychloroquine was used in monotherapy in six patients (mainly mild disease with comorbidities), and in association with lopinavir/ritonavir (3) and azithromycin (5) in moderate to severe disease. Other QT-prolonging therapies were used in five patients: oseltamivir (3), omeprazole (1), morphine (1) and ketamine (1). At 48 hours of treatment, two patients temporarily suspended hydroxychloroquine due to QTc prolongation (>500 ms). All patients completed the whole treatment. No other side effects or deaths occurred. Conclusion: Clinical trials are evolving to define hydroxychloroquine effectivity and safety.

Question: Given [Baicalin suppresses the progression of Type 2 diabetes-induced liver tumor through regulating METTL3/m6A/HKDC1 axis and downstream p-JAK2/STAT1/clevaged Capase3 pathway. Background: Epidemiological and clinical evidence suggests that diabetes increases the risk of liver cancer. Although the co-occurrence of type 2 diabetes (T2D) and liver cancer is becoming more frequent, the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Even though baicalin, extensively used in traditional Chinese medicine (TCM), can control T2D and inhibit liver cancer separately, minimal research is available regarding its possible effect on T2D-induced liver cancer. Thus, in the present study, we aimed to investigate the role of baicalin in T2D-induced hepatocellular cancer, and for the first time, we particularly emphasized the regulation of baicalin in genes RNA m6A in hepatocellular cancer. Methods: Here, we constructed a cell culture model under a high concentration of glucose and a T2D-induced liver tumor model to evaluate the in vitro and in vivo role of baicalin in T2D-induced liver cancer progression. After confirming the suppressive effect of baicalin and the HKDC1 antibody on T2D-induced liver tumors, the epigenetic alterations (DNA 5mC and RNA m6A) of the baicalin-regulated HKDC1 gene were detected using MS and q-PCR. Next, the METTL3 gene-regulated m6A (2854 site) was investigated using SELECT PCR. Finally, the impact of the other three baicalin analogs (baicalein, wogonoside, and wogonin) on tumor inhibition was tested in vivo while verifying the related RNA m6A mechanism. Results: The results showed that baicalin and the HKDC1 antibody suppressed T2D-induced liver tumor progression in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, baicalin significantly inhibited the epigenetic modification (DNA 5mC and RNA m6A) of HKDC1 in HepG2 tumors, mainly targeting the RNA m6A site (2854). The m6A-related gene, METTL3, regulated the RNA m6A site (2854) of HKDC1, which was also restricted by baicalin. Moreover, the study verified that baicalin regulated the METTL3/HKDC1/JAK2/STAT1/caspase-3 pathway in liver cancer cells when exposed to a high glucose concentration. In addition, the three baicalin analogs were proven to regulate the m6A (2854 site) of HKDC1 and suppress T2D-induced liver tumors. Conclusions: The findings of this study revealed that baicalin suppressed T2D-induced liver tumor progression by regulating the METTL3/m6A/HKDC1 axis, which might support its potential application for preventing and treating T2D-induced liver cancer.] you can assume that [Baicalin, extensively used in traditional Chinese medicine, can suppress type 2 diabetes-induced liver tumor progression by regulating the METTL3/m6A/HKDC1 axis.].

Question: Given [Initial dose reduction of enzalutamide does not decrease the incidence of adverse events in castration-resistant prostate cancer. Background There was no clear evidence whether the initial dose of enzalutamide affects the incidence of adverse events (AEs), and oncological outcome in patients with castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC). Methods The clinical charts of 233 patients with CRPC treated with enzalutamide were reviewed retrospectively. After 1:3 propensity score matching (PSM), 124 patients were divided into a reduced dose group and a standard dose group, and the prostate specific antigen (PSA) response and the incidence of AEs were compared. Results 190 patients with CRPC initiated with standard dose enzalutamide were younger and better performance status compared with 43 patients beginning with reduced dose. After PSM, the baseline characteristics were not different between the standard and the reduced dose group. In the PSM cohort, the PSA response rate was significantly lower in the reduced dose group than in the standard dose group (-66.3% and -87.4%, p = 0.02). The incidence rates of AEs were not statistically different between the groups (22.6% and 34.4%, respectively, p = 0.24). Conclusion Initiating treatment with a reduced dose of enzalutamide did not significantly decrease the incidence rate of AEs, and it showed poorer PSA response rate.

Question: Given [Quantifying the effect of Wakefield et al. (1998) on skepticism about MMR vaccine safety in the U.S.. Background Efforts to trace the rise of childhood vaccine safety concerns in the US often suggest Andrew Wakefield and colleagues' retracted 1998 Lancet study (AW98)-which alleged that the MMR vaccine can cause children to develop autism-as a primary cause of US vaccine skepticism. However, a lack of public opinion data on MMR safety collected before/after AW98's publication obscures whether anecdotal accounts are indicative of a potentially-causal effect. Methods We address this problem using a regression discontinuity framework to study change in monthly MMR injury claims (N = 74,850; from 1990-2019) from the Vaccine Adverse Events Reporting System (VAERS) to proxy concern about vaccine safety. Additionally, we suggest a potential mechanism for the effect of AW98 on vaccine skepticism, via automated sentiment analyses of MMR-related news stories (N = 674; from 1996-2000) in major television and newspaper outlets. Results AW98 led to an immediate increase of about 70 MMR injury claims cases per month, averaging across six estimation strategies (meta-analytic effect = 70.44 [52.19, 88.75], p < 0.01). Preliminary evidence suggests that the volume of negative media attention to MMR increased in the weeks following AW98's publication, across four estimation strategies (meta-analytic effect = 9.59% [3.66, 15.51], p < 0.01). Conclusions Vaccine skepticism increased following the publication of AW98, which was potentially made possible by increased negative media coverage of MMR. Significance Childhood vaccine skepticism presents an important challenge to widespread vaccine uptake, and undermines support for pro-vaccine health policies. In addition to advancing our understanding of the previously-obscured origins of US vaccine skepticism, our work cautions that high-profile media attention to inaccurate scientific studies can undermine public confidence in vaccines.

Question: Given [Sofosbuvir-velpatasvir in Mexican patients with hepatitis C: A retrospective review. Introduction: The sofosbuvir-velpatasvir (SOF/VEL) combination is a direct-acting antiviral therapy that is authorized and available in Mexico, making the performance of a real-world multicenter study that evaluates the sustained virologic response at 12 weeks post-treatment a relevant undertaking. Methods: A retrospective review of the case records of 241 patients seen at 20 hospitals in Mexico was conducted to assess hepatitis C treatment with the SOF/VEL combination (n = 231) and the sofosbuvir/velpatasvir/ribavirin (SOF/VEL/RBV) combination (n = 10). The primary efficacy endpoint was the percentage of patients that achieved SVR at 12 weeks after the end of treatment. Results: Overall SVR was 98.8% (95% CI 97.35-100%). Only three patients did not achieve SVR, two of whom had cirrhosis and a history of previous treatment with peg-IFN. Of the subgroups analyzed, all the patients with HIV coinfection, three patients with genotype 3, and the patients treated with the SOF/VEL/RBV combination achieved SVR. The subgroups with the lower success rates were patients that were treatment-experienced (96.8%) and patients with F1 fibrosis (95.5%). The most frequent adverse events were fatigue, headache, and insomnia. No serious adverse events were reported.

Question: Given [RON Mediates Tumor-Promoting Effects in Endometrial Adenocarcinoma. Endometrial adenocarcinoma is one of the most prevalent female reproductive tract cancers in the world, and the development of effective treatment is still the main goal of its current research. Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) plays a significant part in the occurrence and development of epithelial carcinoma, including endometrial adenocarcinoma. Recepteur d'origine nantais (RON) induces EMT and promotes proliferation, migration, and invasion in various epithelial-derived cancers, but its role in endometrial adenocarcinoma is still poorly studied. The purpose of this study is to verify the overexpression of RON in endometrial adenocarcinoma and to explore its specific roles. RON expression in tumor lesions was verified by immunohistochemical staining, HEC-1B cells were used to construct stable cell lines with RON overexpression or knockdown to investigate the effects of RON on the function of endometrial adenocarcinoma cells, and xenotransplantation experiment was carried out in nude mice to explore the effect of RON on the growth of endometrial adenocarcinoma in vivo. This study revealed that RON could promote the proliferation, migration, and invasion of HEC-1B cells and induce EMT, and these effects were regulated through the Smad pathway. RON overexpression could promote growth of endometrial adenocarcinoma cells in nude mice, while its inhibitor BMS777607 could restrict this role. RON played an important role in endometrial adenocarcinoma and had a potential to become a new therapeutic target for endometrial adenocarcinoma.

Question: Given [Apremilast Prolongs the Time to First Biologic Therapy in Japanese Patients with Psoriasis. Introduction: Biologic agents are used in patients with severe psoriasis who have not adequately responded to existing conventional systemic therapies. However, only a limited number of medical institutions in Japan are approved to use them, and their relatively high cost represents a substantial burden to patients. Apremilast is an oral phosphodiesterase-4 inhibitor approved in Japan for the treatment of psoriasis vulgaris in adult patients with an inadequate response to topical therapies and psoriatic arthritis in adult patients with active disease. To date, a large-scale real-world study of treatment patterns and costs associated with apremilast in Japan has not been conducted. The objective of this study was to assess whether apremilast can prolong time to first biologic therapy use and decrease total medical cost. Methods: Using the Medical Data Vision hospital-based claims database, 506 psoriasis patients were propensity score matched and analyzed (apremilast: n = 253; non-apremilast: n = 253). Results: The incidence rate of first biologic therapy use per 1000 patient-years was significantly lower in the apremilast group than in the non-apremilast group (30.3 vs. 107.6; P < 0.001), and the total medical costs per month were significantly lower in the apremilast group than in the non-apremilast group (76,594 yen/month vs. 102,411 yen/month, P < 0.001). In a sensitivity analysis of a propensity-score-matched subset of eligible patients prescribed biologics during the follow-up period (apremilast: n = 14; non-apremilast: n = 14), the incidence of first biologic therapy use was 2,797.6 per 1000 patient-years (95% CI: 1,656.9, 4,723.6) in the non-apremilast group and 856.1 per 1000 patient-years (95% CI: 507.0, 1,445.5) in the apremilast group. Conclusion: These results suggest that apremilast prolongs the time to first biologic therapy use in patients with psoriasis, thereby reducing the total medical cost and decreasing the economic burden on patients.] you can assume that [Apremilast can reduce total medical costs per month compared to the non-apremilast group in Japanese patients with psoriasis.].

Question: Given [Raloxifene in the Treatment of Osteoporosis in Postmenopausal Women with End-Stage Renal Disease: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis. As a selective estrogen receptor modulator (SERM), raloxifene is used in healthy postmenopausal women to prevent bone loss and reduce fractures. However, the benefit of raloxifene is uncertain in the treatment of osteoporosis among patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) or those who require maintenance dialysis. We assessed the safety and efficacy of raloxifene in this particular population. Studies were selected from PubMed, Springer, CNKI (Chinese National Knowledge Infrastructure) and Wanfang Database. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and prospective studies with control/placebo groups were included. Five studies were included with a total of 244 participants (121 patients in the raloxifene group and 123 patients in the placebo/control group). The median duration of treatment was 12 months. The incidence rate of side effects of raloxifene was 0/121 (0%). There was a significant improvement of lumbar spine bone mineral density (BMD) levels in the raloxifene group compared with the placebo group (MD: 33.88, 95% CI: 10.93, 56.84, p=0.004).

Question: Given [Apremilast Prolongs the Time to First Biologic Therapy in Japanese Patients with Psoriasis. Introduction: Biologic agents are used in patients with severe psoriasis who have not adequately responded to existing conventional systemic therapies. However, only a limited number of medical institutions in Japan are approved to use them, and their relatively high cost represents a substantial burden to patients. Apremilast is an oral phosphodiesterase-4 inhibitor approved in Japan for the treatment of psoriasis vulgaris in adult patients with an inadequate response to topical therapies and psoriatic arthritis in adult patients with active disease. To date, a large-scale real-world study of treatment patterns and costs associated with apremilast in Japan has not been conducted. The objective of this study was to assess whether apremilast can prolong time to first biologic therapy use and decrease total medical cost. Methods: Using the Medical Data Vision hospital-based claims database, 506 psoriasis patients were propensity score matched and analyzed (apremilast: n = 253; non-apremilast: n = 253). Results: The incidence rate of first biologic therapy use per 1000 patient-years was significantly lower in the apremilast group than in the non-apremilast group (30.3 vs. 107.6; P < 0.001), and the total medical costs per month were significantly lower in the apremilast group than in the non-apremilast group (76,594 yen/month vs. 102,411 yen/month, P < 0.001). In a sensitivity analysis of a propensity-score-matched subset of eligible patients prescribed biologics during the follow-up period (apremilast: n = 14; non-apremilast: n = 14), the incidence of first biologic therapy use was 2,797.6 per 1000 patient-years (95% CI: 1,656.9, 4,723.6) in the non-apremilast group and 856.1 per 1000 patient-years (95% CI: 507.0, 1,445.5) in the apremilast group. Conclusion: These results suggest that apremilast prolongs the time to first biologic therapy use in patients with psoriasis, thereby reducing the total medical cost and decreasing the economic burden on patients.] you can imply that [Apremilast can reduce total medical costs per month compared to the non-apremilast group in Japanese patients with psoriasis.].

Question: Given [Raloxifene in the Treatment of Osteoporosis in Postmenopausal Women with End-Stage Renal Disease: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis. As a selective estrogen receptor modulator (SERM), raloxifene is used in healthy postmenopausal women to prevent bone loss and reduce fractures. However, the benefit of raloxifene is uncertain in the treatment of osteoporosis among patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) or those who require maintenance dialysis. We assessed the safety and efficacy of raloxifene in this particular population. Studies were selected from PubMed, Springer, CNKI (Chinese National Knowledge Infrastructure) and Wanfang Database. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and prospective studies with control/placebo groups were included. Five studies were included with a total of 244 participants (121 patients in the raloxifene group and 123 patients in the placebo/control group). The median duration of treatment was 12 months. The incidence rate of side effects of raloxifene was 0/121 (0%). There was a significant improvement of lumbar spine bone mineral density (BMD) levels in the raloxifene group compared with the placebo group (MD: 33.88, 95% CI: 10.93, 56.84, p=0.004). There was no significant difference concerning the improvement of femoral neck BMD (MD: 8.42, 95% CI: -10.21, 27.04, p=0.38), intact parathyroid hormone (iPTH) (MD: -12.62, 95% CI: -35.36, 10.13, p=0.28), calcium (MD: -0.08, 95% CI: -0.61, 0.44, p=0.76), phosphorus (MD: 0.18, 95% CI: -0.12, 0.48, p=0.23) or bone alkaline phosphatase (BAP) (MD: -4.33, 95% CI: -14.44, 5.79, p=0.40). Raloxifene seems to be effective in improving the lumbar spine BMD in postmenopausal women with ESRD. More large RCTs are necessary to evaluate the long-term safety of raloxifene in uremic patients.] you can imply that [The long-term safety of raloxifene in the treatment of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women with uremia has not been established yet.].

Question: Given [A methyltransferase-defective vesicular stomatitis virus-based SARS-CoV-2 vaccine candidate provides complete protection against SARS-CoV-2 infection in hamsters. The current pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has led to dramatic economic and health burdens. Although the worldwide SARS-CoV-2 vaccination campaign has begun, exploration of other vaccine candidates is needed due to uncertainties with the current approved vaccines, such as durability of protection, cross-protection against variant strains, and costs of long-term production and storage. In this study, we developed a methyltransferase-defective recombinant vesicular stomatitis virus (mtdVSV)based SARS-CoV-2 vaccine candidate. We generated mtdVSVs expressing SARS-CoV-2 full-length spike (S) protein, S1, or its receptor-binding domain (RBD). All of these recombinant viruses grew to high titers in mammalian cells despite high attenuation in cell culture. The SARS-CoV-2 S protein and its truncations were highly expressed by the mtdVSV vector. These mtdVSV-based vaccine candidates were completely attenuated in both immunocompetent and immunocompromised mice. Among these constructs, mtdVSV-S induced high levels of SARS-CoV-2-specific neutralizing antibodies (NAbs) and Th1-biased T-cell immune responses in mice. In Syrian golden hamsters, the serum levels of SARS-CoV-2-specific NAbs triggered by mtdVSV-S were higher than the levels of NAbs in convalescent plasma from recovered COVID-19 patients. In addition, hamsters immunized with mtdVSV-S were completely protected against SARS-CoV-2 replication in lung and nasal turbinate tissues, cytokine storm, and lung pathology. Collectively, our data demonstrate that mtdVSV expressing SARS-CoV-2 S protein is a safe and highly efficacious vaccine candidate against SARS-CoV-2 infection. IMPORTANCE Viral mRNA cap methyltransferase (MTase) is essential for mRNA stability, protein translation, and innate immune evasion. Thus, viral mRNA cap MTase activity is an excellent target for development of live attenuated or live vectored vaccine candidates. Here, we developed a panel of MTase-defective recombinant vesicular stomatitis virus (mtdVSV)-based SARS-CoV-2 vaccine candidates expressing full-length S, S1, or several versions of the RBD. These mtdVSV-based vaccine candidates grew to high titers in cell culture and were completely attenuated in both immunocompetent and immunocompromised mice. Among these vaccine candidates, mtdVSV-S induces high levels of SARS-CoV-2-specific neutralizing antibodies (Nabs) and Th1-biased immune responses in mice. Syrian golden hamsters immunized with mtdVSV-S triggered SARS-CoV-2-specific NAbs at higher levels than those in convalescent plasma from recovered COVID-19 patients. Furthermore, hamsters immunized with mtdVSV-S were completely protected against SARS-CoV-2 challenge.

Aims The aim of this case report is to specify the frequency and mortality of Metformin-Associated Lactic Acidosis (MALA) in emergency medicine, as the diagnosis seems to occur more often than estimated. Methods To identify the subjects, we developed screening criteria for MALA. We measured the serum metformin concentration to confirm the diagnosis in all patients fulfilling these criteria. Retrospectively the patients were grouped according to individual risk (according to a defined risk score) and the application of renal replacement therapy. Results From 2013 until 2018 we were able to identify 11 MALA patients revealing a frequency of 1:4,000 emergency patients. Six patients survived and five died in the follow-up. All three patients in the high-risk group died although all of them received renal replacement therapy. In the low-risk group (three patients, one with renal replacement therapy), all patients survived, while in the intermediate-risk group (five patients, one with renal replacement therapy) three patients survived and two died. Additional severe comorbidities also contributed to mortality. Conclusions Every patient matching the screening criteria of acute renal failure, lactic acidosis and continued intake of metformin can be considered a potential MALA case. A risk score assessment which includes severe comorbidities may help to identify high-risk individuals and should be evaluated in larger studies.To prevent MALA, patients should be trained to immediately interrupt their own metformin use when showing signs of volume depletion.

In the low-risk group (three patients, one with renal replacement therapy), all patients survived, while in the intermediate-risk group (five patients, one with renal replacement therapy) three patients survived and two died. Additional severe comorbidities also contributed to mortality. Conclusions Every patient matching the screening criteria of acute renal failure, lactic acidosis and continued intake of metformin can be considered a potential MALA case. A risk score assessment which includes severe comorbidities may help to identify high-risk individuals and should be evaluated in larger studies.To prevent MALA, patients should be trained to immediately interrupt their own metformin use when showing signs of volume depletion.

Question: Given [Metformin Associated Lactic Acidosis in Clinical Practice - A Case Series. Aims The aim of this case report is to specify the frequency and mortality of Metformin-Associated Lactic Acidosis (MALA) in emergency medicine, as the diagnosis seems to occur more often than estimated. Methods To identify the subjects, we developed screening criteria for MALA. We measured the serum metformin concentration to confirm the diagnosis in all patients fulfilling these criteria. Retrospectively the patients were grouped according to individual risk (according to a defined risk score) and the application of renal replacement therapy. Results From 2013 until 2018 we were able to identify 11 MALA patients revealing a frequency of 1:4,000 emergency patients. Six patients survived and five died in the follow-up. All three patients in the high-risk group died although all of them received renal replacement therapy.

Question: Given [Blinatumomab-related pneumatosis intestinalis in a pediatric patient with relapsed acute lymphoblastic leukemia: A case report. Introduction: Pneumatosis intestinalis is characterized by air in the subserosal or submucosal layer of the intestine, with the severity ranging from mild and asymptomatic to symptomatic with serious conditions such as intestinal ischemia and perforation requiring surgery. Although several etiologies, including those from conventional chemotherapy agents and molecular target agents, have been suggested, blinatumomab-related pneumatosis intestinalis is quite rare. Case report: An 11-year-old girl with history of B-cell ALL presented with bone marrow relapse 3 years after completion of initial chemotherapy. Reinduction chemotherapy and blinatumomab as post-reinduction consolidation were initiated. On day 28 of blinatumomab therapy, pneumatosis intestinalis from the ascending colon to the hepatic flexure was found incidentally on abdominal computed tomography. Management and outcome: After withholding blinatumomab therapy for 1 month, pneumatosis intestinalis improved significantly without abnormal gastrointestinal symptoms. Blinatumomab was resumed and safely completed. The computed tomography performed 4 months later showed complete resolution of pneumatosis intestinalis. The patient has been in good condition for over 1 year to date. Discussion: To our knowledge, this is the first case report of pneumatosis intestinalis after blinatumomab therapy in a pediatric patient with relapsed precursor B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia.

Question: Given [Real-Time Analysis of Antiproliferative Effects of Mouthwashes Containing Alcohol, Sodium Fluoride, Cetylpyridinium Chloride, and Chlorhexidine in Vitro. Objectives. In this study, the cytotoxic responses of six different over-the-counter mouthwashes on L929 cells were analyzed by two different techniques: the traditional colorimetric tetrazolium-based reduction assay (MTT) and the modern impedance-based real-time cell analysis (RTCA) system to investigate their biocompatibility in vitro. Thus, the investigation of the antiproliferative effects of the specified materials via different techniques is vital to reach this goal. Materials and Methods. First, L929 mouse fibroblasts were exposed to the dilutions of mouthwashes for 2 minutes. After incubation, the tetrazolium reduction method was used to assess the metabolic viability of cells measured by colorimetric MTT assay and morphological inspection of cells was performed via phase-contrast microscopy. Furthermore, the effect of each mouthwash on the proliferation, morphology, and adhesion of L929 cells was monitored continuously by a noninvasive and label-free RTCA system for 140 h. Results. Our data showed that all of the mouthwashes had varying cytotoxic effects on fibroblasts compared to the control group in MTT assay. In addition to that, RTCA technology has provided the growth kinetic profiles that can be used to analyze if the treatment is causing antimitotic or DNA-damaging effect on cells. Thus, analysis via this system can tell us the mechanism of toxicity behind the cell growth inhibition in vitro. Here, we found that only mouthwash 1 moderately maintained the viability of the L929 cells, yet displaying antimitotic effects and the other mouthwashes (mouthwash 2-mouthwash 6) showed toxicity via DNA-damaging effects. Conclusions. Of the six types of mouthwash tested, the most biocompatible result was obtained from a mouthwash containing alcohol (i.e., mouthwash 1).

Question: Given [Disruption of KCC2 in Parvalbumin-Positive Interneurons Is Associated With a Decreased Seizure Threshold and a Progressive Loss of Parvalbumin-Positive Interneurons. GABAA receptors are ligand-gated ion channels, which are predominantly permeable for chloride. The neuronal K-Cl cotransporter KCC2 lowers the intraneuronal chloride concentration and thus plays an important role for GABA signaling. KCC2 loss-of-function is associated with seizures and epilepsy. Here, we show that KCC2 is expressed in the majority of parvalbumin-positive interneurons (PV-INs) of the mouse brain. PV-INs receive excitatory input from principle cells and in turn control principle cell activity by perisomatic inhibition and inhibitory input from other interneurons. Upon Cre-mediated disruption of KCC2 in mice, the polarity of the GABA response of PV-INs changed from hyperpolarization to depolarization for the majority of PV-INs. Reduced excitatory postsynaptic potential-spike (E-S) coupling and increased spontaneous inhibitory postsynaptic current (sIPSC) frequencies further suggest that PV-INs are disinhibited upon disruption of KCC2. In vivo, PV-IN-specific KCC2 knockout mice display a reduced seizure threshold and develop spontaneous sometimes fatal seizures.

High suspicion of central nervous system tuberculosis in an endemic country like ours, led us to start antitubercular therapy and steroids. Repeated lumbar punctures resulted in a dry tap leading to a delay in diagnosis. Serum cryptococcal antigen detection came positive, following which antifungal treatment was initiated. Later a small amount of cerebrospinal fluid sample was obtained which confirmed the diagnosis of cryptococcosis. However, the patient worsened and succumbed to the illness. This case highlighted the rare presentation of cryptococcal cerebellar stroke and spinal arachnoiditis.

Question: Given [Real-world outcomes of tyrosine kinase inhibitors immediately after immune checkpoint inhibitors in renal cell carcinoma. Background/Aim: Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) have demonstrated a survival benefit for patients with cancer. However, the clinical outcomes of subsequent tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) after ICI failure in patients with metastatic renal cell carcinoma (mRCC) remain unclear. Patients and Methods: We retrospectively examined 38 patients with mRCC who started TKIs immediately after nivolumab with (combination group) or without ipilimumab (nivolumab group) between September 2016 and July 2019. Results: Of the 38 patients, 16 and 11 achieved partial response and stable disease, respectively, resulting in a 42.1% objective response rate and 71.1% disease control rate. The median progression-free survival (PFS) from TKI initiation was 8.8 and 12.9 months in the nivolumab and combination groups, respectively. PFS and overall survival were significantly longer in patients with long-term responses to previous ICI treatment (p=0.0152 and p=0.0155, respectively). Conclusion: TKIs demonstrate adequate anti-tumour activity after treatment with ICIs in real-world settings.] you can imply that [Adding ipilimumab to nivolumab for renal cell carcinoma treatment increases median progression-free survival compared to nivolimumab alone.].

Question: Given [Pharmacological inhibition of Ref-1 enhances the therapeutic sensitivity of papillary thyroid carcinoma to vemurafenib. The use of the BRAF inhibitor vemurafenib exhibits drug resistance in the treatment of thyroid cancer (TC), and finding more effective multitarget combination therapies may be an important solution. In the present study, we found strong correlations between Ref-1 high expression and BRAF mutation, lymph node metastasis, and TNM stage. The oxidative stress environment induced by structural activation of BRAF upregulates the expression of Ref-1, which caused intrinsic resistance of PTC to vemurafenib. Combination inhibition of the Ref-1 redox function and BRAF could enhance the antitumor effects of vemurafenib, which was achieved by blocking the action of Ref-1 on BRAF proteins. Furthermore, combination treatment could cause an overload of autophagic flux via excessive AMPK protein activation, causing cell senescence and cell death in vitro. And combined administration of Ref-1 and vemurafenib in vivo suppressed PTC cell growth and metastasis in a cell-based lung metastatic tumor model and xenogeneic subcutaneous tumor model. Collectively, our study provides evidence that Ref-1 upregulation via constitutive activation of BRAF in PTC contributes to intrinsic resistance to vemurafenib. Combined treatment with a Ref-1 redox inhibitor and a BRAF inhibitor could make PTC more sensitive to vemurafenib and enhance the antitumor effects of vemurafenib by further inhibiting the MAPK pathway and activating the excessive autophagy and related senescence process.] you can assume that [Combined treatment with a Ref-1 redox inhibitor and a BRAF inhibitor makes papillary thyroid carcinoma more sensitive to vemurafenib and enhances the antitumor effects of vemurafenib.].

Question: Given [Receptor mechanisms mediating the anti-neuroinflammatory effects of endocannabinoid system modulation in a rat model of migraine. Calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP), substance P and dural mast cells are main contributors in neurogenic inflammation underlying migraine pathophysiology. Modulation of endocannabinoid system attenuates migraine pain, but its mechanisms of action remain unclear. We investigated receptor mechanisms mediating anti-neuroinflammatory effects of endocannabinoid system modulation in in vivo migraine model and ex vivo hemiskull preparations in rats. To induce acute model of migraine, a single dose of nitroglycerin was intraperitoneally administered to male rats. Moreover, isolated ex vivo rat hemiskulls were prepared to study CGRP and substance P release from meningeal trigeminal afferents. We used methanandamide (cannabinoid agonist), rimonabant (cannabinoid receptor-1 CB1 antagonist), SR144528 (CB2 antagonist) and capsazepine (transient receptor potential vanilloid-1 TRPV1 antagonist) to explore effects of endocannabinoid system modulation on the neurogenic inflammation, and possible involvement of CB1, CB2 and TRPV1 receptors during endocannabinoid effects. Methanandamide attenuated nitroglycerin-induced CGRP increments in in vivo plasma, trigeminal ganglia and brainstem and also in ex vivo hemiskull preparations. Methanandamide also alleviated enhanced number and degranulation of dural mast cells induced by nitroglycerin. Rimonabant, but not capsazepine or SR144528, reversed the attenuating effects of methanandamide on CGRP release in both in vivo and ex vivo experiments. Additionally, SR144528, but not rimonabant or capsazepine, reversed the attenuating effects of methanandamide on dural mast cells. However, neither nitroglycerin nor methanandamide changed substance P levels in both in vivo and ex vivo experiments.

Recently, levels of anti-SARS-CoV-2 spike IgG antibodies and serum neutralization titers were confirmed as good immune markers of protection against the virus, with evidence showing a reverse correlation between these two parameters and susceptibility to infection. Here we analyzed sera from 138 nursing home residents (median age of 88.9 years) and 312 nursing home staff (median age of 50.7 years) to determine the humoral response to two doses of the BNT162b2 vaccine, and found markedly decreased serum anti-spike antibody levels and neutralization titers in the nursing home resident (NHR) group, with over 11% non-responders compared to only 1.3% among the controls. Moreover, three months post-vaccination, a significant decrease in antibody titers was observed in COVID-19-naive nursing home residents. Subsequent flow cytometry and interferon gamma secretion analyses indicated that antibody non-responders among NHRs also failed to mount cellular responses.

Question: Given [Reduction of DNMT3a and RORA in the nucleus accumbens plays a causal role in post-traumatic stress disorder-like behavior: reversal by combinatorial epigenetic therapy. Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is an incapacitating trauma-related disorder, with no reliable therapy. Although PTSD has been associated with epigenetic alterations in peripheral white blood cells, it is unknown where such changes occur in the brain, and whether they play a causal role in PTSD. Using an animal PTSD model, we show distinct DNA methylation profiles of PTSD susceptibility in the nucleus accumbens (NAc). Data analysis revealed overall hypomethylation of different genomic CG sites in susceptible animals. This was correlated with the reduction in expression levels of the DNA methyltransferase, DNMT3a. Since epigenetic changes in diseases involve different gene pathways, rather than single candidate genes, we next searched for pathways that may be involved in PTSD. Analysis of differentially methylated sites identified enrichment in the RAR activation and LXR/RXR activation pathways that regulate Retinoic Acid Receptor (RAR) Related Orphan Receptor A (RORA) activation. Intra-NAc injection of a lentiviral vector expressing either RORA or DNMT3a reversed PTSD-like behaviors while knockdown of RORA and DNMT3a increased PTSD-like behaviors. To translate our results into a potential pharmacological therapeutic strategy, we tested the effect of systemic treatment with the global methyl donor S-adenosyl methionine (SAM), for supplementing DNA methylation, or retinoic acid, for activating RORA downstream pathways. We found that combined treatment with the methyl donor SAM and retinoic acid reversed PTSD-like behaviors.

Objectives: To evaluate the in vitro antibacterial, antibiofilm, and antivirulence activities of apramycin, comparatively to tobramycin, against a set of P. aeruginosa from chronically infected cystic fibrosis (CF) patients. Methods: The activity of antibiotics against planktonic cells was assessed by performing MIC, MBC, and time-kill assays. The activity against mature biofilms was evaluated, in a microtiter plate, both in terms of dispersion (crystal violet assay) and residual viability (viable cell count). The effect of drug exposure on selected P. aeruginosa virulence genes expression was assessed by real-time Reverse Transcription quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR). Results: Apramycin MIC90 and MBC90 values were found at least fourfold lower than those for tobramycin. A comparable trend was observed for mucoid strains. Only 4 out of 24 strains (16.6%) showed an apramycin MIC higher than the epidemiological cut-off value of 64 mg/L, whereas a higher resistance rate was observed for tobramycin (62.5%; p < 0.01 vs. apramycin). In time-kill analyses, both aminoglycosides were found bactericidal, although apramycin showed a more rapid effect and did not allow for regrowth. Apramycin generally stimulated biofilm biomass formation, whereas tobramycin showed opposite trends depending on the strain tested. Both drugs caused a highly significant, dose-dependent reduction of biofilm viability, regardless of strain and concentration tested. The exposure to apramycin and tobramycin caused increased expression of mexA and mexC (multidrug efflux pumps), whereas tobramycin specifically increased the expression of aprA (alkaline protease) and toxA (exotoxin A).

Methods: A retrospective chart review was conducted including patients with head and neck cancer treated with weekly, low dose cisplatin (40 mg/m2) with concurrent radiotherapy (RT). From this criteria, 22 patients were identified and included in the final analysis. AKI was defined by the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 4.03. Results: Of the 22 patients included, 12 (54.5%) experienced AKI, with 10 patients (45.5%) experiencing grade 1 AKI and 2 patients (9.1%) experiencing grade 2 AKI. Six patients (27.3%) required dose adjustments or delays due to renal adverse events, all of which had initial cisplatin total weekly doses of >70 mg. Those receiving a total weekly cisplatin dose of >70 mg were found to have a higher risk of developing an episode of AKI compared to the group receiving <70 mg (p = 0.029). Conclusion: This analysis showed patients receiving weekly doses >70 mg of cisplatin as their initial treatment dose for head and neck cancer were more likely to experience AKI. There are inconsistencies in the frequency of AKI in our study compared to published literature; however, this comparison is difficult due to the small sample size of our trial.

Question: Given [A rare presentation of panitumumab-involved interstitial lung disease: Spontaneous pneumomediastinum. Introduction: Developments in targeted molecular therapies have considerably improved patient survival in cancer. Panitumumab is a monoclonal antibody against the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). It is used to treat metastatic colorectal carcinoma. Although panitumumab is well tolerated in most patients, pulmonary toxicity, especially interstitial lung disease (ILD), is a life-threatening condition. The presentation of panitumumab-induced ILD with spontaneous pneumomediastinum and subcutaneous emphysema is rarely reported. Case report: We describe a 61-year-old male with metastatic colorectal carcinoma treated with FOLFIRI (folinic acid, 5-fluorouracil, irinotecan) and panitumumab. He presented to our hospital with a complaint of severe dyspnea. On the evaluation of dyspnea, the patient was diagnosed with ILD. Management and outcome: After exclusion of other common causes of pneumomediastinum and subcutaneous emphysema, panitumumab was attributed as a cause of ILD. Oxygen therapy via high flow nasal cannula and intravenous methylprednisolone regimen was started. After two weeks, the patient became asymptomatic with the radiologic amelioration. Discussion: Panitumumab-induced ILD is associated with a poor prognosis and might occur randomly in one year after the drug administration. The possibility of the disease should be considered on every admission. Early recognition, discontinuation of causative medication, and immediate glucocorticoid therapy are essential to reduce mortality.] you can assume that [The FOLFIRI protocol can induce interstitial lung disease.].

Question: Given [Reversal activity and toxicity of heparin-binding copolymer after subcutaneous administration of enoxaparin in mice. Uncontrolled bleeding after enoxaparin (ENX) is rare but may be life-threatening. The only registered antidote for ENX, protamine sulfate (PS), has 60% efficacy and can cause severe adverse side effects. We developed a diblock copolymer, heparin-binding copolymer (HBC), that reverses intravenously administered heparins. Here, we focused on the HBC inhibitory activity against subcutaneously administered ENX in healthy mice. BALB/c mice were subcutaneously injected with ENX at the dose of 5 mg/kg. After 110 min, vehicle, HBC (6.25 and 12.5 mg/kg), or PS (5 and 10 mg/kg) were administered into the tail vein. The blood was collected after 3, 10, 60, 120, 360, and 600 min after vehicle, HBC, or PS administration. The activities of antifactors Xa and IIa and biochemical parameters were measured. The main organs were collected for histological analysis. HBC at the lower dose reversed the effect of ENX on antifactor Xa activity for 10 min after antidote administration, whereas at the higher dose, HBC reversed the effect on antifactor Xa activity throughout the course of the experiment. Both doses of HBC completely reversed the effect of ENX on antifactor IIa activity. PS did not reverse antifactor Xa activity and partially reversed antifactor IIa activity. HBC modulated biochemical parameters. Histopathological analysis showed changes in the liver, lungs, and spleen of mice treated with HBC and in the lungs and heart of mice treated with PS.

Question: Given [Complexation of uranyl (UO2)2+ with bidentate ligands: XRD, spectroscopic, computational, and biological studies. Three new uranyl complexes [(UO2)(OAc)2(CMZ)], [(UO2)(OAc)2(MP)] and [(UO2) (OAc)2(SCZ)] were synthesized and characterized by elemental analysis, FT-IR, UV-Vis spectroscopy, powder XRD analysis, and molar conductivity. The IR analysis confirmed binding to the metal ion by the sulfur and ethoxy oxygen atoms in the carbimazole (CMZ) ligand, while in the 6-mercaptopurine (MP) ligand, the sulfur and the N7 nitrogen atom of a purine coordinated binding to the metal ion. The third ligand showed a 1:1 molar ratio and bound via sulfonamide oxygen and the nitrogen of the pyrimidine ring.

Question: Given [Disulfiram-loaded lactoferrin nanoparticles for treating inflammatory diseases. Sepsis is a dysregulated immune response to infection and potentially leads to life-threatening organ dysfunction, which is often seen in serious Covid-19 patients. Disulfiram (DSF), an old drug that has been used to treat alcohol addiction for decades, has recently been identified as a potent inhibitor of the gasdermin D (GSDMD)-induced pore formation that causes pyroptosis and inflammatory cytokine release. Therefore, DSF represents a promising therapeutic for the treatment of inflammatory disorders. Lactoferrin (LF) is a multifunctional glycoprotein with potent antibacterial and anti-inflammatory activities that acts by neutralizing circulating endotoxins and activating cellular responses. In addition, LF has been well exploited as a drug nanocarrier and targeting ligands. In this study, we developed a DSF-LF nanoparticulate system (DSF-LF NP) for combining the immunosuppressive activities of both DSF and LF. DSF-LF NPs could effectively block pyroptosis and inflammatory cytokine release from macrophages. Treatment with DSF-LF NPs showed remarkable therapeutic effects on lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced sepsis.

Question: Given [Robust and prototypical immune responses toward influenza vaccines in the high-risk group of Indigenous Australians. Morbidity and mortality rates from seasonal and pandemic influenza occur disproportionately in high-risk groups, including Indigenous people globally. Although vaccination against influenza is recommended for those most at risk, studies on immune responses elicited by seasonal vaccines in Indigenous populations are largely missing, with no data available for Indigenous Australians and only one report published on antibody responses in Indigenous Canadians. We recruited 78 Indigenous and 84 non-Indigenous Australians vaccinated with the quadrivalent influenza vaccine into the Looking into InFluenza T cell immunity - Vaccination cohort study and collected blood to define baseline, early (day 7), and memory (day 28) immune responses. We performed in-depth analyses of T and B cell activation, formation of memory B cells, and antibody profiles and investigated host factors that could contribute to vaccine responses. We found activation profiles of circulating T follicular helper type-1 cells at the early stage correlated strongly with the total change in antibody titers induced by vaccination. Formation of influenza-specific hemagglutinin-binding memory B cells was significantly higher in seroconverters compared with nonseroconverters. In-depth antibody characterization revealed a reduction in immunoglobulin G3 before and after vaccination in the Indigenous Australian population, potentially linked to the increased frequency of the G3m21* allotype. Overall, our data provide evidence that Indigenous populations elicit robust, broad, and prototypical immune responses following immunization with seasonal inactivated influenza vaccines.

Question: Given [Disulfiram-loaded lactoferrin nanoparticles for treating inflammatory diseases. Sepsis is a dysregulated immune response to infection and potentially leads to life-threatening organ dysfunction, which is often seen in serious Covid-19 patients. Disulfiram (DSF), an old drug that has been used to treat alcohol addiction for decades, has recently been identified as a potent inhibitor of the gasdermin D (GSDMD)-induced pore formation that causes pyroptosis and inflammatory cytokine release. Therefore, DSF represents a promising therapeutic for the treatment of inflammatory disorders. Lactoferrin (LF) is a multifunctional glycoprotein with potent antibacterial and anti-inflammatory activities that acts by neutralizing circulating endotoxins and activating cellular responses. In addition, LF has been well exploited as a drug nanocarrier and targeting ligands. In this study, we developed a DSF-LF nanoparticulate system (DSF-LF NP) for combining the immunosuppressive activities of both DSF and LF. DSF-LF NPs could effectively block pyroptosis and inflammatory cytokine release from macrophages. Treatment with DSF-LF NPs showed remarkable therapeutic effects on lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced sepsis. In addition, this therapeutic strategy was also applied to treat ulcerative colitis (UC), and substantial treatment efficacy was achieved in a murine colitis model.

Question: Given [Immunogenicity of the Oral Rabies Vaccine Strain SPBN GASGAS in Dogs Under Field Settings in Namibia. Dog-mediated rabies is endemic throughout Africa. While free-roaming dogs that play a crucial role in rabies transmission are often inaccessible for parenteral vaccination during mass dog vaccination campaigns, oral rabies vaccination (ORV) is considered to be a promising alternative to increase vaccination coverage in these hard-to-reach dogs. The acceptance of ORV as an efficient supplementary tool is still low, not least because of limited immunogenicity and field trial data in local dogs. In this study, the immunogenicity of the highly attenuated 3rd-generation oral rabies vaccine strain SPBN GASGAS in local free-roaming dogs from Namibia was assessed by determining the immune response in terms of seroconversion for up to 56 days post-vaccination. At two study sites, free-roaming dogs were vaccinated by administering the vaccine either by direct oral administration or via a vaccine-loaded egg bait. Pre- and post-vaccination blood samples were tested for rabies virus neutralizing as well as binding antibodies using standard serological assays. A multiple logistic regression (MLR) analysis was performed to determine a possible influence of study area, vaccination method, and vaccine dose on the seroconversion rate obtained. About 78% of the dogs vaccinated by the oral route seroconverted (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, ELISA), though the seroconversion as determined by a rapid fluorescence focus inhibition test (RFFIT) was much lower. None of the factors examined had a significant effect on the seroconversion rate. This study confirms the immunogenicity of the vaccine strain SPBN GASGAS and the potential utility of ORV for the control of dog-mediated rabies in African dogs.] you can assume that [The study confirms the immunogenicity of the vaccine strain SPBN GASGAS and the utility of oral rabies vaccination for the control of dog-mediated rabies in humans.].

Importance: Limited data exist on the real-world safety outcomes of patients with neovascular age-related macular degeneration treated with brolucizumab (Beovu). Objective: To determine the real-world incidence of intraocular inflammation (IOI), including retinal vasculitis (RV) and/or retinal vascular occlusion (RO), for patients with neovascular age-related macular degeneration who underwent brolucizumab treatment. Additionally, potential risk factors associated with these adverse events were evaluated. Design, Setting, and Participants: This cohort study included patients with neovascular age-related macular degeneration in the Intelligent Research in Sight (IRIS) Registry and Komodo Healthcare Map. Patients initiating and receiving 1 or more brolucizumab injections from October 8, 2019, to June 5, 2020, with up to 6 months of follow-up were included. Intervention: Brolucizumab injections.

Results: Of 10654 and 11161 included eyes (from the IRIS Registry and Komodo Health database, respectively), the median follow-up times were 97 and 95 days. Most eyes switched from another anti-vascular endothelial growth factor agent (9686 of 10654 [90.9%] and 10487 of 11161 [94.0%], respectively), most commonly aflibercept (7160 of 9686 [73.9%] and 7156 of 10487 [68.2%]), and most were from women (6105 of 10654 [57.3%] and 6452 of 11161 [57.8%]).

Question: Given [Immunogenicity of the Oral Rabies Vaccine Strain SPBN GASGAS in Dogs Under Field Settings in Namibia. Dog-mediated rabies is endemic throughout Africa. While free-roaming dogs that play a crucial role in rabies transmission are often inaccessible for parenteral vaccination during mass dog vaccination campaigns, oral rabies vaccination (ORV) is considered to be a promising alternative to increase vaccination coverage in these hard-to-reach dogs. The acceptance of ORV as an efficient supplementary tool is still low, not least because of limited immunogenicity and field trial data in local dogs. In this study, the immunogenicity of the highly attenuated 3rd-generation oral rabies vaccine strain SPBN GASGAS in local free-roaming dogs from Namibia was assessed by determining the immune response in terms of seroconversion for up to 56 days post-vaccination. At two study sites, free-roaming dogs were vaccinated by administering the vaccine either by direct oral administration or via a vaccine-loaded egg bait. Pre- and post-vaccination blood samples were tested for rabies virus neutralizing as well as binding antibodies using standard serological assays. A multiple logistic regression (MLR) analysis was performed to determine a possible influence of study area, vaccination method, and vaccine dose on the seroconversion rate obtained. About 78% of the dogs vaccinated by the oral route seroconverted (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, ELISA), though the seroconversion as determined by a rapid fluorescence focus inhibition test (RFFIT) was much lower. None of the factors examined had a significant effect on the seroconversion rate. This study confirms the immunogenicity of the vaccine strain SPBN GASGAS and the potential utility of ORV for the control of dog-mediated rabies in African dogs.] you can infer that [The study confirms the immunogenicity of the vaccine strain SPBN GASGAS and the utility of oral rabies vaccination for the control of dog-mediated rabies in humans.].

Question: Given [Safety of components and platforms of COVID-19 vaccines considered for use in pregnancy: A rapid review. Background: Rapid assessment of COVID-19 vaccine safety during pregnancy is urgently needed. Methods: We conducted a rapid systematic review, to evaluate the safety of COVID-19 vaccines selected by the COVID-19 Vaccines Global Access-Maternal Immunization Working Group in August 2020, including their components and their technological platforms used in other vaccines for pregnant persons. We searched literature databases, COVID-19 vaccine pregnancy registries, and explored reference lists from the inception date to February 2021 without language restriction. Pairs of reviewers independently selected studies through COVIDENCE, and performed the data extraction and the risk of bias assessment. Discrepancies were resolved by consensus. Registered on PROSPERO (CRD42021234185). Results: We retrieved 6757 records and 12 COVID-19 pregnancy registries from the search strategy; 38 clinical and non-clinical studies (involving 2,398,855 pregnant persons and 56 pregnant animals) were included. Most studies (89%) were conducted in high-income countries and were cohort studies (57%). Most studies (76%) compared vaccine exposures with no exposure during the three trimesters of pregnancy. The most frequent exposure was to AS03 adjuvant, in the context of A/H1N1 pandemic influenza vaccines, (n = 24) and aluminum-based adjuvants (n = 11). Only one study reported exposure to messenger RNA in lipid nanoparticles COVID-19 vaccines. Except for one preliminary report about A/H1N1 influenza vaccination (adjuvant AS03), corrected by the authors in a more thorough analysis, all studies concluded that there were no safety concerns. Conclusion: This rapid review found no evidence of pregnancy-associated safety concerns of COVID-19 vaccines or of their components or platforms when used in other vaccines. However, the need for further data on several vaccine platforms and components is warranted, given their novelty.

Question: Given [Screening and Analysis of Anaplasma marginale Tunisian Isolates Reveal the Diversity of lipA Phylogeographic Marker and the Conservation of OmpA Protein Vaccine Candidate. Bovine anaplasmosis caused by Anaplasma marginale is a disease responsible for serious animal health problems and great economic losses all over the world. Thereby, the identification of A. marginale isolates from various bioclimatic areas in each country, the phylogeographic analysis of these isolates based on the most informative markers, and the evaluation of the most promising candidate antigens are crucial steps in developing effective vaccines against a wide range of A. marginale strains. In order to contribute to this challenge, a total of 791 bovine samples from various bioclimatic areas of Tunisia were tested for the occurrence of A. marginale DNA through msp4 gene fragment amplification. Phylogeographic analysis was performed by using lipA and sucB gene analyses, and the genetic relationship with previously characterized A. marginale isolates and strains was analyzed by applying similarity comparison and phylogenetic analysis. To evaluate the conservation of OmpA protein vaccine candidate, almost complete ompA nucleotide sequences were also obtained from Tunisian isolates, and various bioinformatics software were used in order to analyze the physicochemical properties and the secondary and tertiary structures of their deduced proteins and to predict their immunodominant epitopes of B and T cells. A. marginale DNA was detected in 19 bovine samples (2.4%). Risk factor analysis shows that cattle derived from subhumid bioclimatic area were more infected than those that originated from other areas. The analysis of lipA phylogeographic marker indicated a higher diversity of Tunisian A. marginale isolates compared with other available worldwide isolates and strains. Molecular, phylogenetic, and immuno-informatics analyses of the vaccine candidate OmpA protein demonstrated that this antigen and its predicted immunodominant epitopes of B and T cells appear to be highly conserved between Tunisian isolates and compared with isolates from other countries, suggesting that the minimal intraspecific modifications will not affect the potential cross-protective capacity of humoral and cell-mediated immune responses against multiple A. marginale worldwide strains.] you can assume that [The vaccine candidate OmpA protein from Tunisian Anaplasma marginale isolates has minimal intraspecific modifications that will not affect the potential cross-protective capacity against multiple A. marginale strains worldwide.].

Question: Given [Safety of the BNT162b2 mRNA Covid-19 vaccine in a nationwide setting. Background: Preapproval trials showed that messenger RNA (mRNA)-based vaccines against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) had a good safety profile, yet these trials were subject to size and patient-mix limitations. An evaluation of the safety of the BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine with respect to a broad range of potential adverse events is needed. Methods: We used data from the largest health care organization in Israel to evaluate the safety of the BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine. For each potential adverse event, in a population of persons with no previous diagnosis of that event, we individually matched vaccinated persons to unvaccinated persons according to sociodemographic and clinical variables. Risk ratios and risk differences at 42 days after vaccination were derived with the use of the Kaplan-Meier estimator. To place these results in context, we performed a similar analysis involving SARS-CoV-2-infected persons matched to uninfected persons. The same adverse events were studied in the vaccination and SARS-CoV-2 infection analyses. Results: In the vaccination analysis, the vaccinated and control groups each included a mean of 884,828 persons. Vaccination was most strongly associated with an elevated risk of myocarditis (risk ratio, 3.24; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.55 to 12.44; risk difference, 2.7 events per 100,000 persons; 95% CI, 1.0 to 4.6), lymphadenopathy (risk ratio, 2.43; 95% CI, 2.05 to 2.78; risk difference, 78.4 events per 100,000 persons; 95% CI, 64.1 to 89.3), appendicitis (risk ratio, 1.40; 95% CI, 1.02 to 2.01; risk difference, 5.0 events per 100,000 persons; 95% CI, 0.3 to 9.9), and herpes zoster infection (risk ratio, 1.43; 95% CI, 1.20 to 1.73; risk difference, 15.8 events per 100,000 persons; 95% CI, 8.2 to 24.2). SARS-CoV-2 infection was associated with a substantially increased risk of myocarditis (risk ratio, 18.28; 95% CI, 3.95 to 25.12; risk difference, 11.0 events per 100,000 persons; 95% CI, 5.6 to 15.8) and of additional serious adverse events, including pericarditis, arrhythmia, deep-vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, myocardial infarction, intracranial hemorrhage, and thrombocytopenia. Conclusions: In this study in a nationwide mass vaccination setting, the BNT162b2 vaccine was not associated with an elevated risk of most of the adverse events examined. The vaccine was associated with an excess risk of myocarditis (1 to 5 events per 100,000 persons). The risk of this potentially serious adverse event and of many other serious adverse events was substantially increased after SARS-CoV-2 infection.

Question: Given [PAX2 promoter methylation and AIB1 overexpression promote tamoxifen resistance in breast carcinoma patients. Introduction: Disease recurrence is an important obstacle in estrogen receptor positive (ER+) tamoxifen treated breast carcinoma patients. Tamoxifen resistance-related molecular mechanisms are not fully understood. Alteration in DNA methylation which contributes to transcriptional regulation of cancer-related genes plays a crucial role in tamoxifen response. In the present study, the contribution of promoter methylation and mRNA expression of PAX2 and AIB1 in the development of breast carcinoma and tamoxifen refractory was assessed. Methods: Methylation specific-high resolution melting (MS-HRM) analysis and Real-time quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) experiment were performed to analyze the promoter methylation and mRNA expression levels of PAX2 and AIB1 genes in 102 breast tumors and adjacent normal breast specimens. Results: We indicated that PAX2 expression is decreased in breast tissues due to hypermethylation in its promoter region. Compared to the adjacent normal tissues, the tumors exhibited significantly lower relative mRNA levels of PAX2 and increased expression of AIB1. Aberrant promoter methylation of PAX2 and overexpression of AIB1 was observed in tamoxifen resistance patients compared to the sensitive ones. Cox regression analysis exhibited that the increased promoter methylation status of PAX2 and overexpression of AIB1 remained as unfavorable identifiers which influence patients' survival independently. Conclusions: Our results revealed that the aberration in PAX2 promoter methylation and AIB1 overexpression are associated with the tamoxifen response in breast carcinoma patients. Further research is needed to demonstrate the potential of using PAX2 and AIB1 expression and their methylation-mediated regulation as predictive or prognostic biomarkers or as a new target therapy for better disease management.] you can assume that [Aberrations in PAX2 promoter methylation are associated with tamoxifen resistance in breast carcinoma patients.].

Patients: Patients with recurrent vasovagal syncope and no serious comorbid conditions. Intervention: Patients were randomly assigned 1:1 to placebo or midodrine and followed for 12 months. Measurements: The primary outcome measure was the proportion of patients with at least 1 syncope episode during follow-up. Results: The study included 133 patients who had had a median of 6 syncope episodes in the prior year (median age, 32 years; 73% female). Compared with patients receiving placebo, fewer patients receiving midodrine had at least 1 syncope episode (28 of 66 [42%] vs. 41 of 67 [61%]). The relative risk was 0.69 (95% CI, 0.49 to 0.97; P = 0.035). The absolute risk reduction was 19 percentage points (CI, 2 to 36 percentage points), and the number needed to treat to prevent 1 patient from having syncope was 5.3 (CI, 2.8 to 47.6).

Question: Given [Screening and Analysis of Anaplasma marginale Tunisian Isolates Reveal the Diversity of lipA Phylogeographic Marker and the Conservation of OmpA Protein Vaccine Candidate. Bovine anaplasmosis caused by Anaplasma marginale is a disease responsible for serious animal health problems and great economic losses all over the world. Thereby, the identification of A. marginale isolates from various bioclimatic areas in each country, the phylogeographic analysis of these isolates based on the most informative markers, and the evaluation of the most promising candidate antigens are crucial steps in developing effective vaccines against a wide range of A. marginale strains. In order to contribute to this challenge, a total of 791 bovine samples from various bioclimatic areas of Tunisia were tested for the occurrence of A. marginale DNA through msp4 gene fragment amplification. Phylogeographic analysis was performed by using lipA and sucB gene analyses, and the genetic relationship with previously characterized A. marginale isolates and strains was analyzed by applying similarity comparison and phylogenetic analysis. To evaluate the conservation of OmpA protein vaccine candidate, almost complete ompA nucleotide sequences were also obtained from Tunisian isolates, and various bioinformatics software were used in order to analyze the physicochemical properties and the secondary and tertiary structures of their deduced proteins and to predict their immunodominant epitopes of B and T cells. A. marginale DNA was detected in 19 bovine samples (2.4%). Risk factor analysis shows that cattle derived from subhumid bioclimatic area were more infected than those that originated from other areas. The analysis of lipA phylogeographic marker indicated a higher diversity of Tunisian A. marginale isolates compared with other available worldwide isolates and strains. Molecular, phylogenetic, and immuno-informatics analyses of the vaccine candidate OmpA protein demonstrated that this antigen and its predicted immunodominant epitopes of B and T cells appear to be highly conserved between Tunisian isolates and compared with isolates from other countries, suggesting that the minimal intraspecific modifications will not affect the potential cross-protective capacity of humoral and cell-mediated immune responses against multiple A. marginale worldwide strains.] you can assume that [The vaccine candidate OmpA protein from Tunisian Anaplasma marginale isolates has minimal intraspecific modifications that will not affect the potential cross-protective capacity against multiple A. marginale strains worldwide.].

BACKGROUND: The intensity of the thromboprophylaxis needed as a potential factor for preventing inpatient mortality due to coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) remains unclear. OBJECTIVE: To explore the association between anticoagulation intensity and COVID-19 survival. DESIGN AND SETTING: Retrospective observational study in a tertiary-level hospital in Spain. METHODS: Low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) status was ascertained based on prescription at admission. To control for immortal time bias, anticoagulant use was analyzed as a time-dependent variable. RESULTS: 690 patients were included (median age, 72 years).

Question: Given [Impact of COVID-19 pandemic on TB prevention and care in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia: A retrospective database study. Objective The current COVID-19 pandemic in Ethiopia could cause severe dysfunction in tuberculosis (TB) treatment, diagnostic services, and prevention and control efforts. In this study, we evaluated the effect of COVID-19 on TB service indicators in Addis Ababa, where more than two-thirds of the country's COVID-19 morbidity was recorded. Design We performed a comparative retrospective study to evaluate the impact of COVID-19 on TB services during the pre-COVID-19 era (from April 2019 to March 2020) and the COVID-19 era (from April 2020 to March 2021) in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. We extracted data on total TB detection rate, TB treatment success rate, isoniazid prophylaxis therapy, and drug susceptibility tests and others from the health information system. Using Poisson regression, we estimated the incidence rate ratios and the absolute number difference of the indicators (number per quarter and year) in the COVID-19 and pre-COVID-19 eras. Results Compared with the pre-COVID-19 era, the total TB detection, bacteriologically confirmed TB, TB treatment success rate, latent TB infection treatment and community health workers' engagement in TB detection decreased, respectively, by 11%, 11.8%, 17%, 44.7% and 77.2% during the COVID-19 period. Rifampicin resistance increased by 27.7% during the same period. Comparative analysis showed a significant decline in these TB service indicators (p<0.001) Conclusion The COVID-19 pandemic has had a negative impact on TB service indicators in Addis Ababa.

The aetiological and pathophysiological pathways remain to be clearly elucidated but are potentially related to increased choroidal vascular permeability. In this case, the subretinal fluid resolved rapidly and completely after cessation of travoprost drops, showing it to be a reversible pathology similar to prostaglandin-associated cystoid macular oedema. This uncommon association is therefore important to consider in the differential diagnosis of serous macular detachment. Increasing ophthalmic awareness could help to prevent unnecessary investigations in undifferentiated patients without other guiding historical or examination features.

Question: Given [Serous macular detachments associated with topical travoprost. Here is presented a unique case of bilateral serous macular detachments as a side effect of topical travoprost (0.004%) therapy. Only three other cases in the literature have definitively associated this side effect with other topical prostaglandins. The aetiological and pathophysiological pathways remain to be clearly elucidated but are potentially related to increased choroidal vascular permeability. In this case, the subretinal fluid resolved rapidly and completely after cessation of travoprost drops, showing it to be a reversible pathology similar to prostaglandin-associated cystoid macular oedema. This uncommon association is therefore important to consider in the differential diagnosis of serous macular detachment. Increasing ophthalmic awareness could help to prevent unnecessary investigations in undifferentiated patients without other guiding historical or examination features. This may save time and expense for the patient and health systems.

Question: Given [Prevalence and correlates of restless legs syndrome in men living with HIV. Background Data on the prevalence and correlates of restless legs syndrome (RLS) in people with HIV are limited. This study sought to determine the prevalence of RLS, associated clinical correlates, and characterize sleep-related differences in men with and without HIV. Methods Sleep-related data were collected in men who have sex with men participating in the Multicenter AIDS Cohort Study (MACS). Demographic, health behaviors, HIV status, comorbidities, and serological data were obtained from the MACS visit coinciding with sleep assessments. Participants completed questionnaires, home polysomnography, and wrist actigraphy. RLS status was determined with the Cambridge-Hopkins RLS questionnaire. RLS prevalence was compared in men with and without HIV. Multinomial logistic regression was used to examine correlates of RLS among all participants and men with HIV alone. Sleep-related differences were examined in men with and without HIV by RLS status. Results The sample consisted of 942 men (56% HIV+; mean age 57 years; 69% white). The prevalence of definite RLS was comparable in men with and without HIV (9.1% vs 8.7%). In multinomial regression, HIV status was not associated with RLS prevalence. However, white race, anemia, depression, and antidepressant use were each independently associated with RLS. HIV disease duration was also associated with RLS. Men with HIV and RLS reported poorer sleep quality, greater sleepiness, and had worse objective sleep efficiency/ fragmentation than men without HIV/RLS. Conclusions The prevalence of RLS in men with and without HIV was similar.

Question: Given [Severity of Illness in Persons Infected With the SARS-CoV-2 Delta Variant vs Beta Variant in Qatar. Importance: The Delta variant is now the predominant circulating SARS-CoV-2 strain worldwide. Severity of illness in persons infected with the SARS-CoV-2 Delta variant compared with the Beta variant is not known. Objective: To directly compare clinical outcomes in persons infected with the SARS-CoV-2 Delta variant vs those infected with the Beta variant in Qatar. Design, Setting, and Participants: This retrospective cohort study used data from the national COVID-19 database in Qatar, which includes information on all individuals who were ever tested for SARS-CoV-2 using a reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction test and all individuals who received any SARS-CoV-2 vaccine in Qatar. Among persons with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection between March 22 and July 7, 2021, those infected with the Delta variant were identified and were propensity score matched with control individuals infected with the Beta variant. The variants were ascertained by variant genotyping of the positive samples. Exposures: SARS-CoV-2 infection with the Delta or Beta variant. Main Outcomes and Measures: The main outcomes were admission to the hospital, admission to the intensive care unit, use of supplemental oxygen, use of high-flow oxygen, receipt of mechanical ventilation, or death among those infected with the Delta or Beta variant overall and stratified by vaccination status. Results: Among 1427 persons infected with the Delta variant (252 [55.9%] male; median age, 34 years [IQR, 17-43 years]) and 5353 persons infected with the Beta variant (233 [51.7%] male; median age, 34 years [IQR, 17-45 years]), 451 propensity score-matched pairs were identified. Persons infected with the Delta variant were more likely to be hospitalized (27.3% [95% CI, 23.2%-31.6%] vs 20.0% [95% CI, 16.4-24.0]; P =.01) or to have mild-moderate or severe-critical disease outcomes (27.9% [95% CI, 23.8%-32.3%] vs 20.2% [95% CI, 16.6%-24.2%]; P =.01) compared with persons infected with the Beta variant. Infection with the Delta variant was independently associated with higher odds of experiencing any adverse outcome (adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 2.53; 95% CI, 1.72-3.72). Compared with being unvaccinated, being vaccinated with a second dose more than 3 months before infection was associated with lower odds of any adverse outcome among persons infected with the Delta variant (aOR, 0.11; 95% CI, 0.04-0.26) and among those infected with the Beta variant (aOR, 0.22; 95% CI, 0.05-0.98). Protection was similar among those who received a second vaccine dose less than 3 months before infection, but having received only a single dose was not associated with a lower odds of any severe outcome among those infected with the Delta variant (aOR, 1.12; 95% CI, 0.41-3.06) or those infected with the Beta variant (aOR, 0.74; 95% CI, 0.20-2.72). Conclusions and Relevance: In this cohort study of persons with COVID-19 in Qatar, infection with the SARS-CoV-2 Delta variant was associated with more severe disease than was infection with the Beta variant. Being unvaccinated was associated with greater odds of severe-critical disease.

Question: Given [Clinical Spectrum of TGM6-Related Movement Disorders: A New Report with a Pooled Analysis of 48 Patients. Background Spinocerebellar ataxias (SCAs) are a diverse group of progressive neurodegenerative disorders. Until now, more than 20 genes have been implicated to be associated with this phenotype and TGM6 is one of these genes, associated with spinocerebellar ataxia-35 (SCA-35). The majority of disease-causing variants in the TGM6 gene predominantly have been reported from China and Taiwan and the association with Parkinson's disease (PD) have also been reported recently. Methods We report the first Indian case with SCA-35 in a 16-year-old-boy with atypical age of onset at 9 years, prominent extrapyramidal features, intellectual disability, and a novel missense mutation in the TGM6 gene. We also reviewed and collated all previously published cases with pathogenic TGM6 variants. Results Including the index case, 54 cases were identified from 10 relevant articles in literature and 48 cases had adequate clinical details to be included in the pooled analysis. Around two-thirds of reported cases had SCA-35 phenotype, with cerebellar atrophy. Onset in the majority of cases was the fourth decade of life onwards. A proportion of SCA-35 cases also had spasmodic torticollis, impaired proprioception, extrapyramidal features, and myoclonic jerks. The patients with PD had often early-onset milder symptoms, slower progression, and favorable response to levodopa/carbidopa. One patient each presented with episodic ataxia and dystonic tremor of the upper limb. Most of the cases had missense mutations, without any definite hotspot or genotype-phenotype correlation.

Question: Given [Complications after thoracic endovascular aortic repair for ruptured thoracic aortic aneurysms remain high compared with elective repair. Objective: Thoracic endovascular aortic repair (TEVAR) for ruptured thoracic aortic aneurysms is associated with increased perioperative mortality and morbidity compared with intact repair. The purpose of our study was to evaluate the factors associated with the presentation of ruptured aneurysms and adverse outcomes after repair. Methods: The Vascular Quality Initiative (VQI) registry was queried (2010-2020) to identify patients who had undergone TEVAR for ruptured and intact thoracic aortic aneurysms. The primary outcome was to identify the factors associated with ruptured thoracic aortic aneurysms. The secondary outcomes included perioperative mortality and morbidity, 5-year survival, and the identification of factors associated with adverse outcomes after TEVAR. Results: Of the 3039 patients identified with a thoracic aortic aneurysm, 2806 (92%) had undergone repair for an intact aneurysm and 233 (8%) had undergone repair for a ruptured aneurysm. Chronic kidney disease was associated with a greater odds of a presentation with a ruptured aneurysm (odds ratio [OR], 3.1; 95% confidence interval [CI], 2.0-4.9; P < .001). The factors associated with a lower odds of rupture included prior aortic aneurysm repair (OR, 0.71; 95% CI, 0.49-0.97; P = .05), prior smoker (OR, 0.36; 95% CI, 0.24-0.53; P < .001), preoperative beta-blocker therapy (OR, 0.57; 95% CI, 0.41-0.80; P = .001), and preoperative statin therapy (OR, 0.68; 95% CI, 0.49-0.94; P = .020). TEVAR for ruptured thoracic aortic aneurysms was associated with higher perioperative mortality (rupture vs intact, 27% vs 4.6%; OR, 6.6; 95% CI 4.3-10; P < .001) and the composite outcome of mortality, new dialysis, paralysis, and stroke (38% vs 9.5%; OR, 5.1; 95% CI, 3.5-7.4; P < .001).

Question: Given [Short-term fenofibrate treatment improves ultrastructure of hepatocytes of old rats. Introduction. Fenofibrate (FN) is a hypolipemic drug used for the treatment of mixed dyslipidemia. Since in our previous study FN administration to young and old rats adversely affected the serum activity of liver marker enzymes, we decided to examine the effects of FN on liver ultrastructure of young and old animals. Material and methods. Young and old rats were fed standard rodent chow supplemented with 0.1% FN for 30 days. Liver samples obtained from animals under full anesthesia were processed by routine methods to obtain ultrathin and histological sections for the examination by light microscopy (LM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Furthermore, liver lysates were analyzed by Western blotting for the expression of the autophagy-related proteins LC3A/B and beclin 1. Results. The ultrastructure of hepatocytes in both age groups was well-preserved, with the presence of abundant mitochondria, numerous peroxisomes and lysosomes, glycogen stored in the form of rosettes, and occasionally autolysosomes. However, hepatocytes of old control rats contained less mitochondria and peroxisomes, and more lipid droplets than cells of young animals. The effects of FN on liver ultrastructure were age-depended. FN increased the relative number of mitochondria and peroxisomes in the hepatocytes of old, and did not af-fect their number in young rats. Moreover, FN decreased and increased the relative number of lipid droplets in the hepatocytes of old and young rats, respectively. At the LM level, Oil Red O staining revealed smaller and larger lipid droplets within hepatocytes and non-parenchymal liver cells. In the livers of young and old rats lipid droplets were distributed mainly in the periportal zones of hepatic lobules. Morphometric analysis confirmed that livers of control old rats contained more lipid-stainable areas than those of young ones; however, no effect of FN was observed either in young or old rats. Despite larger size of autolysosomes and autophagic vacuoles in hepatocytes of old rats, the expression of autophagy-related proteins did not differ in the livers of control and fenofibrate-treated young and old animals.

The results of our study suggest that fenofibrate, apart from its hypolipemic action, may have ben-eficial effect on the energy metabolism in the liver of old individuals by increasing the number of mitochondria and peroxisomes in hepatocytes.] you can assume that [An in vitro study using the hepatocytes of old rats suggests that fenofibrate may have a beneficial effect on the energy metabolism in the liver of old individuals.].

Question: Given [Complications after thoracic endovascular aortic repair for ruptured thoracic aortic aneurysms remain high compared with elective repair. Objective: Thoracic endovascular aortic repair (TEVAR) for ruptured thoracic aortic aneurysms is associated with increased perioperative mortality and morbidity compared with intact repair. The purpose of our study was to evaluate the factors associated with the presentation of ruptured aneurysms and adverse outcomes after repair. Methods: The Vascular Quality Initiative (VQI) registry was queried (2010-2020) to identify patients who had undergone TEVAR for ruptured and intact thoracic aortic aneurysms. The primary outcome was to identify the factors associated with ruptured thoracic aortic aneurysms. The secondary outcomes included perioperative mortality and morbidity, 5-year survival, and the identification of factors associated with adverse outcomes after TEVAR. Results: Of the 3039 patients identified with a thoracic aortic aneurysm, 2806 (92%) had undergone repair for an intact aneurysm and 233 (8%) had undergone repair for a ruptured aneurysm. Chronic kidney disease was associated with a greater odds of a presentation with a ruptured aneurysm (odds ratio [OR], 3.1; 95% confidence interval [CI], 2.0-4.9; P < .001). The factors associated with a lower odds of rupture included prior aortic aneurysm repair (OR, 0.71; 95% CI, 0.49-0.97; P = .05), prior smoker (OR, 0.36; 95% CI, 0.24-0.53; P < .001), preoperative beta-blocker therapy (OR, 0.57; 95% CI, 0.41-0.80; P = .001), and preoperative statin therapy (OR, 0.68; 95% CI, 0.49-0.94; P = .020). TEVAR for ruptured thoracic aortic aneurysms was associated with higher perioperative mortality (rupture vs intact, 27% vs 4.6%; OR, 6.6; 95% CI 4.3-10; P < .001) and the composite outcome of mortality, new dialysis, paralysis, and stroke (38% vs 9.5%; OR, 5.1; 95% CI, 3.5-7.4; P < .001).

Question: Given [Improving rates of venous thromboembolism prophylaxis in multiple myeloma patients on immunomodulatory drugs through a pharmacy-based system. Introduction: Immunomodulatory drugs used to treat multiple myeloma carry an increased risk of venous thromboembolic (VTE) disease. Previously published guidelines outline consensus opinion on how to mitigate this risk. Methods: We collected baseline data to analyze how these strategies are utilized at our single institution and sought to improve the rates of anticoagulation for high-risk patients. This was done through a quality improvement project that added pharmacy/haematology oversight to the VTE risk assessment. Results: Thirty-nine patients newly started on IMiDs were assessed for VTE risk. This information was passed on to the myeloma provider for consideration. Twenty-two patients were classified as high risk for VTE. Of the high-risk patients, 14 (64%) were placed on an anticoagulant for thromboprophylaxis. Eleven (79%) of the 14 used direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs). Eight high-risk patients did not receive an anticoagulant for thromboprophylaxis; 4 of these developed VTE. No patients on anticoagulation developed a VTE. This strategy had rare minor bleeding complications. Conclusion: This quality action verifies guideline-based thromboprophylaxis in multiple myeloma and supports the benefit of pharmacy oversight in improving VTE rates.

Question: Given [Retrospective analysis of the incidence and severity of acute kidney injury (AKI) in patients with head and neck cancer receiving weekly cisplatin with radiotherapy (RAISe-AKI). Introduction: Low-dose, weekly cisplatin (40 mg/m2) regimens are currently utilized at Eskenazi Health in Indianapolis, Indiana for the treatment of head and neck cancer due to enhanced tolerability. This retrospective analysis analyzes the incidence, severity, and risk factors for AKI in patients who received this regimen. Methods: A retrospective chart review was conducted including patients with head and neck cancer treated with weekly, low dose cisplatin (40 mg/m2) with concurrent radiotherapy (RT).

Question: Given [Single dose of atezolizumab plus chemotherapy in active psoriasis with advanced non-small cell lung cancer. Introduction: Immunotherapy has been recognized as the standard of care in addition to chemotherapy in the treatment of advanced non-small cell lung cancer.

Case report: We report a case of a patient with advanced non-small cell lung cancer and underlying active psoriasis who experienced a remarkable response, without developing psoriasis flares, following treatment with a single dose of atezolizumab and first-line chemotherapy. Management and outcome: The patient remained asymptomatic 10 months since treatment discontinuation, without disease progression, despite having received only a single dose of atezolizumab and six cycles of chemotherapy. Discussion: Little is known about the optimum duration required to achieve a durable response with immunotherapy. Patients with autoimmune disease are commonly excluded from immunotherapy trials owing to a higher risk of autoimmune disease flares or immune-related adverse events. The remarkable outcome observed in this case offers some insights into the possible durable response with limited doses of immunotherapy and a safer approach for administering immunotherapy in patients with autoimmune disease.

Conclusion: This analysis showed patients receiving weekly doses >70 mg of cisplatin as their initial treatment dose for head and neck cancer were more likely to experience AKI. There are inconsistencies in the frequency of AKI in our study compared to published literature; however, this comparison is difficult due to the small sample size of our trial. This demonstrates the need for further investigation into the issue.] you can imply that [The incidence and severity of acute kidney injury in patients with head and neck cancer receiving weekly cisplatin correlate with cisplatin dosage.].

Question: Given [Single dose of atezolizumab plus chemotherapy in active psoriasis with advanced non-small cell lung cancer. Introduction: Immunotherapy has been recognized as the standard of care in addition to chemotherapy in the treatment of advanced non-small cell lung cancer. Most immunotherapy trials, however, exclude patients with autoimmune disease owing to concerns of disease exacerbation. Case report: We report a case of a patient with advanced non-small cell lung cancer and underlying active psoriasis who experienced a remarkable response, without developing psoriasis flares, following treatment with a single dose of atezolizumab and first-line chemotherapy. Management and outcome: The patient remained asymptomatic 10 months since treatment discontinuation, without disease progression, despite having received only a single dose of atezolizumab and six cycles of chemotherapy. Discussion: Little is known about the optimum duration required to achieve a durable response with immunotherapy. Patients with autoimmune disease are commonly excluded from immunotherapy trials owing to a higher risk of autoimmune disease flares or immune-related adverse events. The remarkable outcome observed in this case offers some insights into the possible durable response with limited doses of immunotherapy and a safer approach for administering immunotherapy in patients with autoimmune disease. Initiating chemotherapy to induce remission in active autoimmune disease prior to administering immunotherapy could potentially be an ideal approach that facilitates the use of immunotherapy in this patient population.] you can imply that [A single dose of atezolizumab plus chemotherapy for advanced non-small cell lung cancer treatment does not induce exacerbation of underlying psoriasis.].

Question: Given [Effectiveness of polymyxin B hemoperfusion in acute exacerbation of interstitial pneumonia: A retrospective analysis. Background; Acute exacerbation (AE) of interstitial pneumonia (IP) occurs commonly and has a poor prognosis. Polymyxin B hemoperfusion (PMX-DHP) has a beneficial effect on AE of some types of IPs, particularly idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). However, little is known about the efficacy of PMX-DHP in the Korean population. The aim of this study was to examine the effectiveness of PMX-DHP in AE of IP. Methods: We conducted a retrospective study of 12 patients with AE of IP, including two patients with AE of IPF, who were treated with PMX-DHP at our center. Treatment with PMX-DHP was carried out once or twice. We collected and analyzed data on changes in oxygenation with PMX-DHP and survival after AE. Results: In patients with AE of IP, the ratio of partial pressure of arterial oxygen to the fraction of inspired oxygen, or the P/F ratio, had significantly improved at the end of the treatment with PMX-DHP (87.0 [80.3 - 130.9] to 200.6 [105.0 - 245.5] mmHg, p = 0.019). The white blood cell (WBC) count had significantly reduced at the end of the treatment (12,400 [8,860 - 20,287] to 6,800 [3,950 - 15,775]/mm3, p = 0.050). The 28-day and in-hospital mortality rates of patients after AE of IP were 41.7 % and 75.0 %, respectively.

Question: Given [Single-Dose Rasburicase Might Be Adequate To Overcome Tumor Lysis Syndrome In Hematological Malignancies. Introduction: Tumor lysis syndrome (TLS) is a commonly observed oncological emergency that requires prompt diagnosis and treatment. Rasburicase is a recombinant urate oxidase endorsed in TLS for the treatment of hyperuricemia. The effect of single-dose 7.5 mg rasburicase at longer follow-ups was not widely investigated. Patients and Methods: Eighty-two patients included in the study with clinical TLS and laboratory TLS. The primary endpoint was the normalization of uric acid (<6mg/dL) within 24 hours of rasburicase administration, which was described as treatment success. The secondary endpoint was defined as having sustained response at the first week. The third endpoint was defined as the reaching the baseline renal function before TLS. Results: We found that the use of a 7.5 mg dose of rasburicase controlled uric acid in 74 of 82 (90,2%) patients at the 24th hour. In the first week, uric acid remained at normal levels in 69 of 82 (84,1%) patients. At 24 hours, the TLS risk group was the only predictor for failing uric acid normalization; at the end of the first week, no predictive factor was identified for failing uric acid normalization. Conclusion: Rasburicase at 7.5 mg dose is an important agent for controlling laboratory and clinical TLS at 24 hours and extending its effect to the first week.] you can assume that [A single dose of 7.5 mg rasburicase normalizes uric acid levels for one week in hematological malignancies-induced tumor lysis syndrome.].

The purpose of this prospective double-blinded positive control study was to compare the efficacy of 2.5% polyacrylamide hydrogel (2.5% PAAG) in the management of middle carpal joint lameness in Thoroughbreds against treatments of triamcinolone acetonide (TA) or sodium hyaluronate (HA). A total of 31 flat-racing Thoroughbreds with lameness (grade 1-3/5) localized to the carpus by intra-articular analgesia were selected. Following a radiological assessment of the carpi confirming the absence of fragment/fracture, the horses were randomly assigned for intra-articular treatment with either 2 ml of 2.5% PAAG, 12 mg TA or 20 mg HA (followed by two further intravenous treatments of 40 mg, at weekly intervals in the HA group only), by a treating veterinarian. All horses were rested for 48 hours post-treatment and then re-entered an unaltered training regimen. Subsequent examinations at 2, 4, and 6 weeks were performed by a blinded examining veterinarian for all groups, while horses treated with 2.5% PAAG were monitored for 12 weeks for recurrence of lameness.

Question: Given [Sitagliptin and Narrow-Band Ultraviolet-B for Moderate Psoriasis (DINUP): A Randomised Controlled Clinical Trial. Background: Sitagliptin, a dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitor licensed for the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), has been reported to improve psoriasis. Objective: We compared the effects of sitagliptin treatment, a DPP-4 inhibitor, in combination with narrow-band ultraviolet-B (NB-UVB) phototherapy compared to NB-UVB alone on psoriasis severity, quality of life, cardiovascular disease risk factors and immune parameters in people with moderate psoriasis without T2DM. Methods: In this 39-week, single-centre, randomised controlled trial, people were allocated randomly to receive sitagliptin for 24 weeks with NB-UVB or NB-UVB alone. The primary endpoint was the change in Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) from baseline to 24 weeks. We estimated that 120 participants would be needed to have 80% power to find a significant difference between the groups. Results: A total of 118 patients were randomised. The median (IQR) baseline PASI was 8.8 (7.5-11.6). At 24 weeks, the mean difference from baseline in PASI (-1.0 [95% CI-2.0 to 0.0]) was significantly larger in the sitagliptin/NB-UVB arm than in the NB-UVB-alone arm (p = 0.044). There were significant differences in the change in Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (-2.5 [95% CI-4.0 to-1.0]; p = 0.002) and EuroQol 5-item questionnaire (0.1 [95% CI 0.0-0.1]; p = 0.036) values from baseline to 24 weeks between the sitagliptin/NB-UVB and the NB-UVB-alone arm. There were no treatment-related serious adverse events. Conclusion: Sitagliptin therapy combined with NB-UVB phototherapy significantly improved psoriasis severity, albeit modestly, compared to NB-UVB phototherapy alone in patients with moderate psoriasis without T2DM.

Question: Given [Sofosbuvir-velpatasvir in Mexican patients with hepatitis C: A retrospective review. Introduction: The sofosbuvir-velpatasvir (SOF/VEL) combination is a direct-acting antiviral therapy that is authorized and available in Mexico, making the performance of a real-world multicenter study that evaluates the sustained virologic response at 12 weeks post-treatment a relevant undertaking. Methods: A retrospective review of the case records of 241 patients seen at 20 hospitals in Mexico was conducted to assess hepatitis C treatment with the SOF/VEL combination (n = 231) and the sofosbuvir/velpatasvir/ribavirin (SOF/VEL/RBV) combination (n = 10). The primary efficacy endpoint was the percentage of patients that achieved SVR at 12 weeks after the end of treatment. Results: Overall SVR was 98.8% (95% CI 97.35-100%). Only three patients did not achieve SVR, two of whom had cirrhosis and a history of previous treatment with peg-IFN. Of the subgroups analyzed, all the patients with HIV coinfection, three patients with genotype 3, and the patients treated with the SOF/VEL/RBV combination achieved SVR.

Differentiation between the two disorders and effective control of both diseases remain challenging. Case Presentation: We present a Chinese girl with typical manifestations of PKD, who also suffered from generalized tonic-clonic seizure attacks at the same time. Genetic testing confirmed a PRRT2 mutation (c.649dupC). Oxcarbazepine was initially used, but withdrawn due to a hypersensitivity reaction. Levetiracetam was initiated afterwards, which was effective for seizures but failed to control her PKD symptoms. The addition of lacosamide (LCM) completely controlled her PKD symptoms.

Question: Given [Soluble PD-L1 as an early marker of progressive disease on nivolumab. Background Soluble PD-L1 (sPD-L1) has been associated with worse prognosis in numerous solid tumors. We determined sPD-L1 levels before and during nivolumab treatment in two prospective clinical trials of metastatic clear cell renal cell carcinoma (RCC) and melanoma patients, and investigated its relationship to clinical factors, biomarkers, and outcome. Methods Using a new Single Molecule Array assay, serum sPD-L1 level were determined in RCC (CheckMate 009, n=91) and melanoma (CheckMate 038-Part 1, n=78) prior to, and at two time points on treatment. Gene expression data was obtained from biopsies taken prior to, and at day 28 on treatment. Results were integrated with clinical variables, tumor PD-L1 status from immuno-histochemistry, and genomic mutation status. Results In RCC patients, sPD-L1 levels were higher in patients with progressive disease as their best response. For both RCC and melanoma patients, progressive or stable disease was associated with an increase in sPD-L1 on nivolumab therapy, whereas mean sPD-L1 levels did not change or declined in patients with objective responses. By categorizing RCC patients into transcriptomic molecular subtypes, we identified a subgroup where the associations between sPD-L1 and progressive disease were particularly evident. In baseline biopsies, we identified six biological processes that were associated with sPD-L1 level in both RCC and melanoma: higher sPD-L1 is associated with lower tumor expression of the Hallmark gene sets 'hypoxia', 'fatty acid metabolism', 'glycolysis', 'MTORC1 signaling' and 'androgen response', and with higher expression of 'KRAS signaling-Down'. Conclusion Baseline and on-therapy sPD-L1 levels in RCC have the potential to predict progressive disease on PD-1 inhibitor nivolumab. In a hypothesis-generating analysis of tumor gene expression, high baseline sPD-L1 is associated with a tumor metabolic state reflecting potentially targetable processes in both melanoma and RCC. In both trials, we observed associations between change in sPD-L1 on treatment and outcome metrics. sPD-L1 levels may further refine a nivolumab-refractory subtype of RCC within transcriptionally based subtypes of RCC.

Question: Given [Speech Characteristics of Patients with Parkinson's Disease-Does Dopaminergic Medications Have a Role?. Objective The present study aimed to investigate the effects of dopaminergic medication on voice, speech motor functions, and motor impairment in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD). Materials and Methods Twenty-five individuals (16 males and 9 females) with PD underwent comprehensive assessment of voice, speech, and motor functions in levodopa medication ON and medication OFF conditions. Age- and gender-matched healthy controls were recruited to compare speech and acoustic parameters. Multi-Dimensional Voice Program (MDVP) from Computerized Speech Laboratory (Model: 4500) was utilized for acoustic analysis of voice and the Voice Handicap Index (VHI) for the self-assessment of vocal function. Frenchay Dysarthria Assessment (FDA-2) and Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale-III (UPDRS III) were used to evaluate speech motor and motor functions, respectively. Statistical Analysis The mean and standard deviation were used as descriptive statistics measures. Raw scores were obtained for FDA-2, DRS, VHI, MDVP parameters, and UPDRS-III in either medication condition. The Wilcoxon signed-rank test was performed to determine the statistical significance of the above measures in both genders across the medication conditions. Spearman's rank correlation coefficient was used to determine the relationship between motor speech function and motor impairment and between VHI and MDVP parameters across both medication conditions. The interrater reliability rating was established using Cohen's kappa. Results An improvement in lip and laryngeal functioning was found in the medication ON over medication OFF state in both males and females with PD. A few frequency and amplitude-related measures improved in the medication-ON state over the medication-OFF state. UPDRS-III scores reduced from the OFF state to the ON state, and no change in dysarthria severity or VHI was found in either gender or medication condition. No correlation was found between speech motor function and motor function or between VHI and acoustic parameters of voice in either medication condition. Conclusions Improvement in motor symptoms with levodopa was predominantly observed when compared with the minor improvements in a few aspects of speech motor function and vocal parameters.
