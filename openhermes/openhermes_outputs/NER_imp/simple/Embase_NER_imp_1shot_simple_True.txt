To understand this better, here are some additional guidelines:

- Make sure that you are not returning 'disease' as one of the 'drugs' and vise versa (as per the first example, 'eicosapentaenoic acid' cannot be considered as a 'disease'),
- If no 'drug' or 'disease' can be extracted from the text, do not add a 'drug' or 'disease'

To determine the drugs mentioned in this text, we first need to identify the various acronyms and abbreviations related to drugs. The text mentions 'SSRI', but that's the only one. The SSRI abbreviation is short for Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor, which is actually a class of drugs and not a specific drug itself. However, a brief search would reveal that popular SSRIs include drugs such as fluoxet
