Question:When was insulin first used to treat patients with diabetes?
Context:1922: The first year of insulin therapy. First prescribers and first patients treated. Insulin was discovered in December 1921. One year later, several hundred diabetic patients were treated in Canada and the United States of America by this hormone changing the clinical spectrum of diabetes. The quick progress from impure pancreatic extracts to an active and safe insulin was obtained through a cooperation, under the aegis of the Insulin Committee of the Toronto University, between the clinicians of the General Hospital of Toronto (Canada), the Department of Physiology of the University of Toronto (Connaught Laboratories) and the US pharmacological industry (Eli-Lilly Company), who achieved a better purification of the extracts permitting large scale production. The story of the first beneficiaries and of the first prescribers illustrates the extraordinary progress this discovery permitted.

Question:What were the adverse events due to Onabotulinum Toxin A?
Context:A Case Report of Systemic Intoxication Following Onabotulinum Toxin A Injections Into the Salivary Glands in a Patient With Spinal Muscular Atrophy Type 1. Background: Sialorrhea in spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) is caused by bulbar weakness, which is aggravated by low oromotor tone rather than saliva overproduction. Botulinum toxin (BTX) reduces sialorrhea by preventing acetylcholine release from the presynaptic secretory parasympathetic nerve terminals. An important adverse effect of BTX, as highlighted in its black box warning, is a systemic spread of BTX leading to botulismlike symptoms including dysphagia, muscle weakness, and death. These symptoms may be more pronounced in peripheral motor neuropathic disorder population such as SMA, whose neuromuscular junction (NMJ) is already dysfunctional. Methods: We report a case of a 17-month-old boy with SMA type 1 following BTX injection for the treatment of sialorrhea. Results: The boy developed severe generalized hypotonia, profound dysphagia, decreased airway clearance, and speech difficulty following BTX injection. Full gastric feeding was required. Pyridostigmine was started but with minimal effect. The patient experienced prolonged deleterious side effects of BTX, lasting upward of a year with very slow recovery of limb strengths and oromotor tone. Conclusions: NMJ dysfunction has been well described in SMA. BTX may exacerbate fragile NMJ function by inhibiting acetylcholine release at the presynaptic vesicles. As such, systematic intoxication of BTX can have far-reaching consequences in this population. A strong precaution and cautious weighing of efficacy and risk must be performed before utilizing BTX in the SMA population.

Question:Which disease is treated with the drug benzo[a]pyrene?
Context:Aspirin ameliorates the cognition impairment in mice following benzo[a]pyrene treatment via down-regulating BDNF IV methylation. Benzo[a]pyrene (B[a]P) is neurotoxic, however, the mechanisms remain unclear and there is no effective prevention. Available evidence suggests a role of DNA methylation in B[a]P-induced neurotoxicity. This study investigated the brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) IV methylation in the development of and aspirin intervention against B[a]P's neurotoxicity in mice and HT22 cells. Mice were intraperitoneally treated with solvent or B[a]P (0.5, 2, and 10 mg/kg b.w.) for 60 days. An intervention group was treated simultaneously with B[a]P (10 mg/kg, i.p.) and aspirin (10 mg/kg, daily water-drinking). The treated mice showed a dose-dependent cognitive and behavioral impairment, and cerebral cell apoptosis, which were alleviated by aspirin co-treatment. Following B[a]P treatment, DNA methyltransferase (DNMTs) and BDNF IV hypermethylation were increased in the cerebral cortex of mice compared to controls, while significant decreases were found in BDNF IV and BDNF mRNA, and BDNF protein levels. Aspirin co-treatment rescued DNMTs activation and BDNF IV hypermethylation, and mitigated the recession in BDNF mRNA and protein induced by B[a]P treatment. Similar results were shown in HT22 cells. These findings reveal a critical role of BDNF IV methylation in the neurotoxicity of B[a]P, and demonstrate a promising prevention of aspirin against B[a]P-induced cognitive impairment via inhibiting BDNF IV hypermethylation.

Question:What effect did berberine show in mice with dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced colitis?
Context:Berberine inhibits dendritic cells differentiation in DSS-induced colitis by promoting Bacteroides fragilis. Backgrounds: Berberine (BBR), a compound long used in traditional Chinese medicine, has been reported to have therapeutic effects in treating ulcerative colitis (UC), attributed to its anti-inflammatory properties and restorative potential of tight junctions (TJs). However, the mechanism by which BBR affects intestinal bacteria and immunity is still unclear. Methods: This study investigated the effects of BBR on intestinal bacteria and the inflammatory response in dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced colitis mice. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) and electron microscopy were used to detect intestinal TJs. Microflora analysis was used to screen for bacteria regulated by BBR. Results: The results showed that BBR had increased colonic epithelium zonula occludens proteins-1 (ZO-1) and occludin expression and reduced T-helper 17/T regulatory ratio in DSS-induced mice. Mechanically, BBR eliminated DSS-induced intestinal flora disturbances in mice, particularly increased Bacteroides fragilis (B. fragilis) in vivo and in vitro. B. fragilis decreased the interleukin-6 induced by dendritic cells through some heat-resistant component rather than nucleic acids or proteins. Conclusions: Overall, these data suggest that BBR had a moderating effect on DSS-induced colitis. This compound may regulate intestinal immune cell differentiation by affecting the growth of B. fragilis, providing new insights into the potential application of BBR in UC.

Question:Is this study performed in patients with ovarian carcinoma?
Context:Caffeic acid phenethyl ester targets ubiquitin-specific protease 8 and synergizes with cisplatin in endometrioid ovarian carcinoma cells. Deubiquitinases (DUBs) mediate the removal of ubiquitin from diverse proteins that participate in the regulation of cell survival, DNA damage repair, apoptosis and drug resistance. Previous studies have shown an association between activation of cell survival pathways and platinum-drug resistance in ovarian carcinoma cell lines. Among the strategies available to inhibit DUBs, curcumin derivatives appear promising, thus we hypothesized their use to enhance the efficacy of cisplatin in ovarian carcinoma preclinical models. The caffeic acid phenethyl ester (CAPE), inhibited ubiquitin-specific protease 8 (USP8), but not proteasomal DUBs in cell-free assays. When CAPE was combined with cisplatin in nine cell lines representative of various histotypes a synergistic effect was observed in TOV112D cells and in the cisplatin-resistant IGROV-1/Pt1 variant, both of endometrioid type and carrying mutant TP53. In the latter cells, persistent G1 accumulation upon combined treatment associated with p27kip1 protein levels was observed. The synergy was not dependent on apoptosis induction, and appeared to occur in cells with higher USP8 levels. In vivo antitumor activity studies supported the advantage of the combination of CAPE and cisplatin in the subcutaneous model of cisplatin-resistant IGROV-1/Pt1 ovarian carcinoma as well as CAPE activity on intraperitoneal disease. This study reveals the therapeutic potential of CAPE in cisplatin-resistant ovarian tumors as well as in tumors expressing USP8.

Question:Is amphotericin A encapsulated in carboxymethyl chitosan lipid nanoformulations used as an oral anti-leishmanial drug?
Context:Carboxymethyl chitosan modified lipid nanoformulations as a highly efficacious and biocompatible oral anti-leishmanial drug carrier system. Herein, carboxymethyl chitosan (CMC) grafted lipid nanoformulations were facilely prepared by thin-film hydration method as a highly efficient biocompatible anti-leishmanial carrier encapsulating amphotericin B (AmB). Nanoformulations were characterized for their physicochemical characteristics wherein TEM analysis confirmed the spherical structure, whereas FTIR analysis revealed the conjugation of CMC onto nanoformulations and confirmed the free state of AmB. Furthermore, the wettability study confirmed the presence of CMC on the surface of nanoformulations attributed to the enhanced hydrophilicity. Surface hydrophilicity additionally contributes towards consistent mucin retention ability for up to 6 h, superior mucoadhesiveness, and hence enhanced bioavailability. The proposed nanoformulations with high encapsulation and drug loading properties displayed controlled drug release in the physiological microenvironment. In vitro, antileishmanial results showed an astounding 97% inhibition in amastigote growth. Additionally, in vivo studies showed that treatment with nanoformulations significantly reduced the liver parasitic burden (93.5%) without causing any toxicity when given orally.

Question:Can schistosomiasis infection cause a perianal fistula?
Context:Case Report of Schistosomiasis Complicated with Perianal Fistula. Schistosomiasis (Bilharziasis) is a disease caused by parasitic worms that live in certain freshwater snails and affect people in developing countries. Chronic Schistosomiasis with perianal fistula is an unusual presentation. We report the case of a 31-year-old Sudanese male who suffered from chronic anal discharge and was found to have a perianal fistula. He began empirically taking oral mesalamine three times daily, then underwent a colonoscopy to rule out Crohn's disease and discovered Schistosoma eggs in a tissue biopsy. This case suggests that Schistosomiasis infection should be considered one of the causes of perianal fistula or abscess if the patient had traveled to endemic areas of Schistosomiasis in the past.

Question:Is phenobarbital an effective antiseizure treatment in neonates?
Context:Characteristics of Neonates with Cardiopulmonary Disease Who Experience Seizures: A Multicenter Study. Objective: To compare key seizure and outcome characteristics between neonates with and without cardiopulmonary disease. Study design: The Neonatal Seizure Registry is a multicenter, prospectively acquired cohort of neonates with clinical or electroencephalographic (EEG)-confirmed seizures. Cardiopulmonary disease was defined as congenital heart disease, congenital diaphragmatic hernia, and exposure to extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. We assessed continuous EEG monitoring strategy, seizure characteristics, seizure management, and outcomes for neonates with and without cardiopulmonary disease. Results: We evaluated 83 neonates with cardiopulmonary disease and 271 neonates without cardiopulmonary disease. Neonates with cardiopulmonary disease were more likely to have EEG-only seizures (40% vs 21%, P <.001) and experience their first seizure later than those without cardiopulmonary disease (174 vs 21 hours of age, P <.001), but they had similar seizure exposure (many-recurrent electrographic seizures 39% vs 43%, P =.27). Phenobarbital was the primary initial antiseizure medication for both groups (90%), and both groups had similarly high rates of incomplete response to initial antiseizure medication administration (66% vs 68%, P =.75). Neonates with cardiopulmonary disease were discharged from the hospital later (hazard ratio 0.34, 95% CI 0.25-0.45, P <.001), although rates of in-hospital mortality were similar between the groups (hazard ratio 1.13, 95% CI 0.66-1.94, P =.64). Conclusion: Neonates with and without cardiopulmonary disease had a similarly high seizure exposure, but neonates with cardiopulmonary disease were more likely to experience EEG-only seizures and had seizure onset later in the clinical course. Phenobarbital was the most common seizure treatment, but seizures were often refractory to initial antiseizure medication. These data support guidelines recommending continuous EEG in neonates with cardiopulmonary disease and indicate a need for optimized therapeutic strategies.

Question:Can unrelated individuals produce genetically similar clones of antibodies against SARS virus spike protein?
Context:Convergent antibody responses to the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein in convalescent and vaccinated individuals. Unrelated individuals can produce genetically similar clones of antibodies, known as public clonotypes, which have been seen in responses to different infectious diseases, as well as healthy individuals. Here we identify 37 public clonotypes in memory B cells from convalescent survivors of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection or in plasmablasts from an individual after vaccination with mRNA-encoded spike protein. We identify 29 public clonotypes, including clones recognizing the receptor-binding domain (RBD) in the spike protein S1 subunit (including a neutralizing, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 [ACE2]-blocking clone that protects in vivo) and others recognizing non-RBD epitopes that bind the S2 domain. Germline-revertant forms of some public clonotypes bind efficiently to spike protein, suggesting these common germline-encoded antibodies are preconfigured for avid recognition. Identification of large numbers of public clonotypes provides insight into the molecular basis of efficacy of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines and sheds light on the immune pressures driving the selection of common viral escape mutants.

Question:Was economic anxiety the main reason behind Covid-19 vaccination hesitancy?
Context:Covid-19 vaccination, fear and anxiety: Evidence from Google search trends. Covid-19 vaccination was associated with a general feeling of hesitancy, and its arrival increased fear and economic anxiety. This paper investigates the impacts of Covid-19 vaccination on fear and economic anxiety using a worldwide sample of 194 countries observed from December 1st, 2020 to March 4th, 2021. The difference-in-differences investigation approach shows that with the vaccine's arrival, the Google search trends measuring fear and anxiety are increasing. The arrival of the vaccine has created a general feeling of fear, and people have a lack of confidence in the vaccine's efficiency to overcome the Covid-19 crisis. Specifically, anxiety increased when the delta variant was discovered in India. Governments' interventions must ensure that the Covid-19 vaccine does not have adverse side effects that can harm public health. We suggested that policy makers should focus on increasing the number of older adults willing to receive the vaccine. It can be effective in explaining the benefits of the vaccine, and denying false information about the vaccine and its serious side effects.

Question:Is mycosis fungoides (MF) a rare form of primary cutaneous T-cell lymphoma?
Context:Cutaneous T-cell lymphoma mimicking myopathy with lipoatrophy. Mycosis fungoides (MF) is the most common form of primary cutaneous T-cell lymphoma. Classic MF usually follows a rather benign course over many years or decades, rarely ever leading to fatal extracutaneous organ involvement. Single cases of muscular involvement have been reported. Here we describe a 42-year-old male patient with hair loss and lipoatrophy since six months diagnosed as follicular MF and with a two months history of progressive distal leg weakness. Muscle biopsy and whole body muscle MRI showed an extensive muscular and subcutaneous fatty tissue infiltration. After therapy with topical steroids and acitretin/PUVA, systemic chemotherapy (CHOP) was initiated. The patient suffered from a rapid disease progression with fatal outcome 2.5 years after the first skin lesions, displaying progressive cachexia, muscular atrophy and weakness with scapuloperoneal distribution and cardiac dysfunction. So far, extensive muscular involvement by MF mimicking a distinct muscular phenotype has not been reported.

Question:Is mycosis fungoides (MF) a rare form of primary cutaneous T-cell lymphoma?
Context:Cutaneous T-cell lymphoma mimicking myopathy with lipoatrophy. Mycosis fungoides (MF) is the most common form of primary cutaneous T-cell lymphoma. Classic MF usually follows a rather benign course over many years or decades, rarely ever leading to fatal extracutaneous organ involvement. Single cases of muscular involvement have been reported. Here we describe a 42-year-old male patient with hair loss and lipoatrophy since six months diagnosed as follicular MF and with a two months history of progressive distal leg weakness. Muscle biopsy and whole body muscle MRI showed an extensive muscular and subcutaneous fatty tissue infiltration. After therapy with topical steroids and acitretin/PUVA, systemic chemotherapy (CHOP) was initiated. The patient suffered from a rapid disease progression with fatal outcome 2.5 years after the first skin lesions, displaying progressive cachexia, muscular atrophy and weakness with scapuloperoneal distribution and cardiac dysfunction. So far, extensive muscular involvement by MF mimicking a distinct muscular phenotype has not been reported.
Answer:<|im_end|> 

Yes, mycosis fungoides (MF) is a rare form of primary cutaneous T-cell lymphoma.<|im_end|>

No, mycosis fungoides (MF) is the most common form of primary cutaneous T-cell lymphoma.

Question:Can dabrafenib be used as a CYP3A4 inhibitor?
Context:Dabrafenib inhibits ABCG2 and cytochrome P450 isoenzymes; potential implications for combination anticancer therapy. Dabrafenib is a BRAF inhibitor used in combination treatment of malignant melanoma and non-small cell lung carcinoma. In this study, we aimed to characterize its interactions with cytochrome P450 (CYP) isoenzymes and ATP-binding cassette (ABC) efflux transporters that have critical impact on the pharmacokinetics of drugs and play a role in drug resistance development. Using accumulation assays, we showed that dabrafenib inhibited ABCG2 and, less potently, ABCB1 transporter. We also confirmed dabrafenib as a CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP3A4, and CYP3A5 inhibitor. Importantly, inhibition of ABCG2 and CYP3A4 by dabrafenib led to the potentiation of cytotoxic effects of mitoxantrone and docetaxel toward respective resistant cell lines in drug combination studies. On the contrary, the synergistic effect was not consistently observed in ABCB1-expressing models. We further demonstrated that mRNA levels of ABCB1, ABCG2, ABCC1, and CYP3A4 were increased after 24 h and 48 h exposure to dabrafenib. Overall, our data confirm dabrafenib as a drug frequently and potently interacting with ABC transporters and CYP isoenzymes. This feature should be addressed with caution when administering dabrafenib to patients with polypharmacy but also could be utilized advantageously when designing new dabrafenib-containing drug combinations to improve the therapeutic outcome in drug-resistant cancer.

Question:Can radioiodine therapy be associated with lacrimal drainage system obstruction?
Context:Dacryoendoscopic recanalization of lacrimal passage obstruction/stenosis after radioiodine therapy for differentiated thyroid carcinoma. Purpose: Radioiodine therapy, a standard treatment for differentiated thyroid carcinomas, is associated with several adverse events including lacrimal drainage system obstruction. Herein, we describe the first case of duct lumen recanalization using dacryoendoscopy for lacrimal passage obstruction and stenosis after radioiodine therapy. Observations: A 48-year-old female treated with radioiodine therapy for differentiated thyroid carcinoma 5 years prior presented with epiphora in both eyes. Dacryocystography showed nasolacrimal duct stenosis in the right eye and nasolacrimal duct obstruction in the left eye. Dacryoendoscopic examination revealed right common canalicular polyps, fibrosis in the right lacrimal sac, right nasolacrimal duct stenosis, and left upper and common canaliculus stenosis. Lacrimal passage recanalization with the insertion of a nasolacrimal stent tube using dacryoendoscopy was performed on the right eye. This successfully resolved the epiphora. Conclusions and importance: Dacryoendoscopic examination for epiphora after radioiodine therapy may help detect early-stage nasolacrimal passage obstruction/stenosis. This condition can be resolved by recanalization and insertion of a lacrimal tube, without the need for a more invasive surgical approach such as dacryocystorhinostomy.

Question:In which brain regions was the expression of BC1 altered after treatement?
Context:Differential expression of H19, BC1, MIAT1, and MALAT1 long non-coding RNAs within key brain reward regions after repeated morphine treatment. Morphine-induced analgesic tolerance and dependence are significant limits of pain control; however, the exact molecular mechanisms underlying morphine tolerance and dependence have remained unclear. The role of long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) in morphine tolerance and dependence is yet to be determined. We aimed to explore the association of specific lncRNAs expression in key brain reward regions after repeated injection of morphine. Male Wistar rats received subcutaneous injections of twice-daily morphine (10 mg/kg) or saline (1 mL/kg) for eight days. On day 8 of the repeated injections, induction of morphine analgesic tolerance and dependence was confirmed through a hotplate test and a naloxone-precipitated withdrawal analysis, respectively. Expression of H19, BC1, MIAT1, and MALAT1 lncRNAs was determined from the midbrain, striatum, hypothalamus, prefrontal cortex (PFC), and hippocampus by real-time PCR on day 8 of the repeated injections. The H19 expression was significantly different between morphine-treated and control saline-treated rats in all investigated areas except for the hippocampus. The BC1 expression significantly altered in the midbrain, hypothalamus, and hippocampus, but not in the striatum and PFC after repeated morphine treatment. The MIAT1 and MALAT1 expression site-specifically altered in the midbrain, hypothalamus, and striatum; however, no significant changes were detected in their expression in the PFC and hippocampus after repeated morphine treatment. We conclude that alterations in the expression of these lncRNAs in the brain reward regions especially in the midbrain, striatum and hypothalamus may have critical roles in the development of morphine dependence and tolerance, which need to be considered in future researches.

Question:Was this a multicenter study?
Context:Effective Letermovir Prophylaxis of CMV infection post allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation: Results from the French temporary authorization of use compassionate program. We report the results of the French Temporary Authorization of Use (ATU) compassionate program of letermovir for primary prophylaxis conducted in 21 transplant centers. Patients were CMV seropositive allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation recipients and at high risk for CMV infection. Primary prophylaxis was defined as initiation of letermovir between day 0 and day +28 post-transplant. Between November 2017 and January 2019, 96 patients with a median age of 56 years received letermovir and follow-up data were available for 78 patients. The median time from transplant to letermovir initiation was 4 days, and the median duration of exposure to letermovir was 78 days, with 57 patients still on treatment at the cutoff date. Letermovir was temporarily discontinued in 4 patients (5.1%) and stopped in 39 patients (50.0%), in most cases due to planned end of treatment (n = 16, 20.5%). Fifteen patients (19.2%) each presented one positive CMV PCR, in median 13 days after letermovir initiation. Clinically significant CMV infection was reported in 5 patients (6.4%). No CMV disease was reported. At least one adverse drug reaction was reported for 12 patients (15.4%). In this early access program, letermovir was effective with comparable results of the phase 3 study with a low rate of clinically significant CMV infection, including in patients who were at high-risk for CMV infection.

Question:Did mice undergo open field, novel object recognition,and passive avoidance at 65 days of age?
Context:Effects of chronic inhibition of phosphodiesterase-4D on behavior and regional rates of cerebral protein synthesis in a mouse model of fragile X syndrome. Fragile X Syndrome (FXS) is caused by silencing the FMR1 gene which results in intellectual disability, hyperactivity, sensory hypersensitivity, autistic-like behavior, and susceptibility to seizures. This X-linked disorder is also associated with reduced cAMP levels in humans as well as animal models. We assessed the therapeutic and neurochemical effects of chronic administration of the phosphodiesterase-4D negative allosteric modulator, BPN14770, in a mouse model of FXS (Fmr1 KO). Groups of male Fmr1 KO mice and control littermates were treated with dietary BPN14770 commencing postnatal day 21. A dose-response effect was investigated. At 90 days of age, mice underwent behavior tests including open field, novel object recognition, three chambered sociability and social novelty tests, passive avoidance, and sleep duration analysis. These tests were followed by in vivo measurement of regional rates of cerebral protein synthesis (rCPS) with the autoradiographic L-[1-14C]leucine method. BPN14770 treatment had positive effects on the behavioral phenotype in Fmr1 KO mice. Some effects such as increased sleep duration and increased social behavior occurred in both genotypes. In the open field, the hyperactivity response in Fmr1 KO mice was ameliorated by BPN14770 treatment at low and intermediate doses. BPN14770 treatment tended to increase rCPS in a dose-dependent manner in WT mice, whereas in Fmr1 KO mice effects on rCPS were less apparent. Results indicate BPN14770 treatment improves some behavior in Fmr1 KO mice. Results also suggest a genotype difference in the regulation of translation via a cAMP-dependent pathway.

Results indicate BPN14770 treatment improves some behavior in Fmr1 KO mice. Results also suggest a genotype difference in the regulation of translation via a cAMP-dependent pathway.
Answer:<|im_end|> 

Yes, the mice underwent open field, novel object recognition, and passive avoidance at 65 days of age. However, the text indicates that the tests were done at 90 days of age, possibly a typo. Please revise the answer to: Yes, the mice underwent tests that included open field, novel object recognition, and passive avoidance at 90 days of age.<|im_end|>

No, mice underwent behavior tests at 90 days of age

Question:How does the level of maternally derived antibodies affect the response to the MMR vaccine in Thai infants?
Context:Evaluation of the effect of maternally derived antibody on response to MMR vaccine in Thai infants. Background: Although the number of measles cases declined globally in response to anti-measles immunisation campaigns, measles has re-emerged. A review of current vaccination policies is required to improve measles elimination strategies. Methods: A pseudotype-based virus neutralisation assay (PVNA) was used to measure neutralising antibody titres in serum samples collected from Thai infants at six timepoints before and after two-doses of MMR (1&2) vaccination (ClinicalTrials.gov no. NCT02408926). Vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) luciferase pseudotypes bearing the haemaglutinin (H) and fusion (F) glycoproteins of measles virus (MeV) were prepared. Serial dilutions of serum samples were incubated with VSV (MeV) pseudotypes and plated onto HEK293-human SLAM1 cells; the neutralising antibody titre was defined as the dilution resulting in 90% reduction in luciferase activity. Results: Neutralising antibody titres in infants born with high levels of maternal immunity (H group) persisted at the time of the first MMR vaccination, and those infants did not respond effectively by developing protective titres. In contrast, infants with lower maternal immunity (L group) developed protective titres of antibody following vaccination. Responses to the second MMR vaccination were significantly higher (P = 0.0171, Wilcoxon signed-rank test) in the H group. The observed correlation between anti-MeV IgG level and neutralising antibody titre in Thai infants indicates the possibility of using rapid IgG testing as a surrogate measure for neutralising activity to define clinical protection levels within populations. Conclusion: These results demonstrate that varying the timing of the first MMR immunisation according to the level of acquired maternal immunity could increase vaccination immunogenicity and hence accelerate measles eradication.
Answer:<|im_end|> 
The level of maternally derived antibodies affects the response to the MMR vaccine in Thai infants as infants born with high levels of maternal immunity do not respond effectively by developing protective titres, while infants with lower maternal immunity develop protective titres following vaccination.<|im_end|>

Infants born with high levels of maternal immunity did not respond effectively to the first MMR vaccination, while responses to the second MMR vaccination were significantly higher.

Question:Which of the RNA-binding proteins presents a new potential target for esophageal squamous cell carcinoma treatment?
Context:HNRNPUL1 inhibits cisplatin sensitivity of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma through regulating the formation of circMAN1A2. Cisplatin (CDDP) is widely used for chemotherapy of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) but the drug resistance limits its therapeutic benefit. Heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein U-like 1 (HNRNPUL1) belongs to the family of RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) and is involved in DNA damage repair. To investigate whether and how HNRNPUL1 affects CDDP resistance of ESCC, we evaluated the expression of HNRNPUL1 and found that it was associated with recurrence in ESCC patients receiving postoperative platinum-based chemotherapy and was an independent prognostic factor for disease-free survival (DFS). Besides, we showed that the reduced expression of HNRNPUL1 enhanced the CDDP sensitivity of ESCC cells. Furthermore, RNA immunoprecipitation coupled with high-throughput sequencing (RIP-seq) were performed and a range of HNRNPUL1-binding RNAs influenced by CDDP treatment were identified followed by bioinformatics analysis. In terms of mechanism, we found that HNRNPUL1 inhibited CDDP sensitivity of ESCC cells by regulating the CDDP sensitivity-inhibited circular RNA (circRNA) MAN1A2 formation. Taken together, our results first demonstrated the role of HNRNPUL1 in CDDP resistance of ESCC and suggested that HNRNPUL1 may be a potential target of ESCC chemotherapy.

Question:Does selenium affect the humoral immune response to the COVID-19 mRNA vaccination?
Context:Humoral immune response to COVID-19 mRNA vaccination in relation to selenium status. The essential trace element selenium (Se) is of central importance for human health and particularly for a regular functioning of the immune system. In the context of the current pandemic, Se deficiency in patients with COVID-19 correlated with disease severity and mortality risk. Selenium has been reported to be associated with the immune response following vaccination, but it is unknown whether this also applies to SARS-CoV-2 vaccines. In this observational study, adult health care workers (n = 126) who received two consecutive anti-SARS-CoV-2 vaccinations by BNT162b2 were followed for up to 24 weeks, with blood samples collected at the first and second dose and at three and 21 weeks after the second dose. Serum SARS-CoV-2 IgG titres, neutralising antibody potency, total Se and selenoprotein P concentrations, and glutathione peroxidase 3 activity were quantified. All three biomarkers of Se status were significantly correlated at all the time points, and participants who reported supplemental Se intake displayed higher Se concentrations. SARS-CoV-2 IgG titres and neutralising potency were highest three weeks after the second dose and decreased towards the last sampling point. The humoral immune response was not related to any of the three Se status biomarkers. Supplemental Se intake had no effect at any time point on the vaccination response as measured by serum SARS-CoV-2 IgG levels or neutralising potency. Overall, no association was found between Se status or supplemental Se intake and humoral immune response to COVID-19 mRNA vaccination.

Question:Which food compounds were found to have a strong affinity for SARS-CoV-2 main protease and therefore could be used to develop a therapeutic agent for SARS-CoV-2 infection?
Context:Identification of Food Compounds as inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2 main protease using molecular docking and molecular dynamics simulations. SARS-CoV-2 has rapidly emerged as a global pandemic with high infection rate. At present, there is no drug available for this deadly disease. Recently, Mpro (Main Protease) enzyme has been identified as essential proteins for the survival of this virus. In the present work, Lipinski's rules and molecular docking have been performed to identify plausible inhibitors of Mpro using food compounds. For virtual screening, a database of food compounds was downloaded and then filtered using Lipinski's rule of five. Then, molecular docking was accomplished to identify hits using Mpro protein as the target enzyme. This led to identification of a Spermidine derivative as a hit. In the next step, Spermidine derivatives were collected from PubMed and screened for their binding with Mpro protein. In addition, molecular dynamic simulations (200 ns) were executed to get additional information. Some of the compounds are found to have strong affinity for Mpro, therefore these hits could be used to develop a therapeutic agent for SARS-CoV-2.

Question:What is the mechanism of the neuroprotective action of insulin-like growth factor II (IGF-II) in cellular and mouse models of Parkinson's disease?
Context:Insulin-like growth factor II prevents oxidative and neuronal damage in cellular and mice models of Parkinson's disease. Oxidative distress and mitochondrial dysfunction, are key factors involved in the pathophysiology of Parkinson's disease (PD). The pleiotropic hormone insulin-like growth factor II (IGF-II) has shown neuroprotective and antioxidant effects in some neurodegenerative diseases. In this work, we demonstrate the protective effect of IGF-II against the damage induced by 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium (MPP+) in neuronal dopaminergic cell cultures and a mouse model of progressive PD. In the neuronal model, IGF-II counteracts the oxidative distress produced by MPP + protecting dopaminergic neurons. Improved mitochondrial function, increased nuclear factor (erythroid-derived 2)-like2 (NRF2) nuclear translocation along with NRF2-dependent upregulation of antioxidative enzymes, and modulation of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signalling pathway were identified as mechanisms leading to neuroprotection and the survival of dopaminergic cells. The neuroprotective effect of IGF-II against MPP + -neurotoxicity on dopaminergic neurons depends on the specific IGF-II receptor (IGF-IIr). In the mouse model, IGF-II prevents behavioural dysfunction and dopaminergic nigrostriatal pathway degeneration and mitigates neuroinflammation induced by MPP+. Our work demonstrates that hampering oxidative stress and normalising mitochondrial function through the interaction of IGF-II with its specific IGF-IIr are neuroprotective in both neuronal and mouse models. Thus, the modulation of the IGF-II/IGF-IIr signalling pathway may be a useful therapeutic approach for the prevention and treatment of PD.

Question:Does intermittent screening and treatment with artemisinin-combination therapy (ISTp-ACT) for malaria in pregnancy work better than intermittent preventive treatment with sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (IPTp-SP)?
Context:Intermittent screening and treatment with artemisinin-combination therapy versus intermittent preventive treatment with sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine for malaria in pregnancy: a systematic review and individual participant data meta-analysis of randomised clinical trials. Background: In sub-Saharan Africa, the efficacy of intermittent preventive therapy in pregnancy with sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine (IPTp-SP) for malaria in pregnancy is threatened by parasite resistance. We conducted an individual-participant data (IPD) meta-analysis to assess the efficacy of intermittent screening with malaria rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) and treatment of RDT-positive women with artemisinin-based combination therapy (ISTp-ACT) compared to IPTp-SP, and understand the importance of subpatent infections. Methods: We searched MEDLINE and the Malaria-in-Pregnancy Library on May 6, 2021 for trials comparing ISTp-ACT and IPTp-SP. Generalised linear regression was used to compare adverse pregnancy outcomes (composite of small-for-gestational-age, low birthweight (LBW), or preterm delivery) and peripheral or placental Plasmodium falciparum at delivery. The effects of subpatent (PCR-positive, RDT/microscopy-negative) infections were assessed in both arms pooled using multi-variable fixed-effect models adjusting for the number of patent infections. PROSPERO registration: CRD42016043789. Findings: Five trials conducted between 2007 and 2014 contributed (10,821 pregnancies), two from high SP-resistance areas where dhfr/dhps quintuple mutant parasites are saturated, but sextuple mutants are still rare (Kenya and Malawi), and three from low-resistance areas (West-Africa). Four trials contributed IPD data (N=10,362). At delivery, the prevalence of any malaria infection (relative risk [RR]=1.08, 95% CI 1.00-1.16, I2=67.0 %) and patent infection (RR=1.02, 0.61-1.16, I2=0.0%) were similar. Subpatent infections were more common in ISTp recipients (RR=1.31, 1.05-1.62, I2=0.0%). There was no difference in adverse pregnancy outcome (RR=1.00, 0.96-1.05; studies=4, N=9,191, I2=54.5%). Subpatent infections were associated with LBW (adjusted RR=1.13, 1.07-1.19), lower mean birthweight (adjusted mean difference=32g, 15-49), and preterm delivery (aRR=1.35, 1.15-1.57). Interpretation: ISTp-ACT was not superior to IPTp-SP and may result in more subpatent infections than the existing IPTp-SP policy. Subpatent infections were associated with increased LBW and preterm delivery. More sensitive diagnostic tests are needed to detect and treat low-grade infections. Funding: Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and Worldwide Antimalarial Resistance Network.
Answer:<|im_end|> 
Based on the context, it can be inferred that intermittent screening and treatment with artemisinin-combination therapy (ISTp-ACT) for malaria in pregnancy was not proven to be superior to intermittent preventive treatment with sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (IPTp-SP). The use of ISTp-ACT may result in more subpatent infections than the existing IPTp-SP policy.<|im_end|>

No, ISTp-ACT is not superior to IPTp-SP and may result in more subpatent infections than the existing IPTp-SP policy.

Question:How late after phacoemulsification can postoperative complications occur?
Context:Late onset corneal decompensation following retained lens fragment in anterior chamber years after uneventful phacoemulsification. Purpose: To report a case of late onset corneal decompensation following cataract surgery due to retained lens fragment in anterior chamber. Observations: A 65 year old female presented with complaint of gradual dimness of vision in left eye since 4 months. She underwent uneventful phacoemulsification with posterior chamber intraocular lens implantation elsewhere 4 years back. On examination, the CDVA in left eye was 20/200. Slit-lamp examination revealed corneal edema with Descemet's folds. She was diagnosed as pseudophakic bullous keratopathy and was being treated with topical steroids, cycloplegics and hyperosmolar agents for the same. She was also counseled about a lamellar corneal transplant. Posterior segment examination was within normal limits. Since the position of the IOL (sulcus versus bag) was not clearly seen ultrasound biomicroscopy (UBM) and anterior segment optical coherence tomography (AS-OCT) imaging was performed to try and better understand the possible cause for corneal decompensation. To our surprise, on both, UBM and ASOCT, a single, retained lens fragment was noted at 6 0'clock in the anterior chamber. AC wash was performed to remove the retained lens fragment. 3 months post AC wash corneal edema resolved completely with improvement in the BCVA to 20/40. Conclusion: AND IMPORTANCE: This case highlights the importance of a thorough clinical evaluation supplemented with imaging modalities in order to make a complete diagnosis and eventually achieve better outcomes for the patient. In any case of unexplained corneal edema, either in the early or late postoperative period, UBM and ASOCT can become very helpful to determine the underlying cause.
Answer:<|im_end|>

Question:what was the result of melatonin treatment in this article
Context:Melatonin improves learning and memory of mice with chronic social isolation stress via an interaction between microglia polarization and BDNF/TrkB/CREB signaling pathway. Chronic social isolation stress (SIS) could impair learning and memory-related behaviors. Herein, we investigated the efficacy of Melatonin in treatment of memory despair and also its possible underlying mechanism of action in an animal model of SIS. For this purpose, mice were allocated to two opposing conditions, including social condition (SC) and isolated condition (IC), for five weeks. The study consisted of three groups, including saline-treated SC, saline-treated IC, Melatonin-treated IC (10 mg/kg/day for five successive days). At the end of the isolation period, mice underwent three neurobehavioral tests: passive avoidance (PA), Morris water maze (MWM), and Y maze (YM) tests. Hippocampus samples were obtained and the expressions of BDNF, TrkB, phosphorylated TrkB (pTrkB), CREB, phosphorylated CREB (pCREB), as well as M1 and M2 microglia were assessed. Interpreting the behavioral tests, we found that isolated mice showed lower freezing response in the PA test, lower number of novel arm visits in the YM, and higher escape latency and less time spent in the target quadrant in the MWM, when compared to SC rodents (P values < 0.001). The isolated group had higher M1/M2 relative ratio (P < 0.001), as well as lower concentrations of BDNF mRNA (p < 0.001) and protein (P < 0.001), TrkB protein (P = 0.035), CREB mRNA (P < 0.001) and protein (P = 0.012), pTrkB (P < 0.001), and pCREB (P = 0.035). However, Melatonin relatively reversed the behavioral, cellular, and molecular effects of SIS. Taken together, melatonin therapy could alleviate memory impairment through switching microglial polarization from M1 to M2 phenotype along with altered expression and function in the BDNF/TrkB/CREB signaling pathway.

Question:what are the effects of administering metanil yellow to rats
Context:Metanil yellow promotes oxidative stress, astrogliosis, and apoptosis in the cerebellar cortex of adult male rat with possible protective effect of scutellarin: A histological and immunohistochemical study. Metanil yellow is a food dye that has harmful impacts on different body systems. Scutellarin has antioxidant, antiapoptotic, and anti-inflammatory activities. The aim of the current research was to study the effect of chronic administration of metanil yellow on the cerebellar cortex of rats and to evaluate the protective effect of scutellarin. Forty adult male rats were allocated into four groups: group I acted as control, group II was administrated scutellarin (100 mg/kg/day), group III was administrated metanil yellow (200 mg/kg/day), and group IV was administrated scutellarin and metanil yellow as in group II and group III. The agents were administered via oral gavage for 8 weeks. Metanil yellow induced a significant rise in the malondialdehyde coupled with a significant reduction in the superoxide dismutase and glutathione peroxidase. The Purkinje cells were irregular and shrunken with condensed nuclei. A significant elevation in glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) and cleaved caspase-3 as well as a significant reduction of synaptophysin expression were revealed in comparison with the control group. Interestingly, few changes were noticed in rats given metanil yellow concomitant with scutellarin. In conclusion, scutellarin could protect against metanil yellow-induced alterations in the cerebellar cortex by reducing oxidative stress and minimizing gliosis.

Context:Panobinostat reverses HepaCAM gene expression and suppresses proliferation by increasing histone acetylation in prostate cancer. Increased expression of histone deacetylases (HDACs) affiliated to the epigenetic regulation is common aberration in prostate cancer (PCa). We have confirmed that hepatocyte cell adhesion molecule (hepaCAM), acting as a tumor suppressor gene, is rarely expressed in PCa previously, However, the mechanisms of which is still unknown. The level of histone acetylation reportedly may involve anti-oncogene transcription and expression. In this study, we investigated the effect of panobinostat, the broad-spectrum histone deacetylases inhibitor, on PCa LNCaP and DU145 cell growth, and observed re-expression of hepaCAM when treated with panobinostat. We demonstrated that intranuclear acetylation of lys9 of histone H3 (Ac-H3K9) were increased, while that of both mRNA and protein of HDAC1, HDAC3, and HDAC4 were decreased when the treating concentration of panobinostat increased. We confirmed the relationship between histone acetylation and the expression of hepaCAM and AR in prostate cancer tissues. We also confirmed that panobinostat could overcome the resistance for androgen deprivation therapy (ADT). Further, we combined panobinostat with Ad-hepaCAM, which resulted in significantly increased antitumor activity and significant attenuation of the proliferation-associated genes CCND1 and PCNA compared to each single treatment. In conclusion, panobinostat may enhance the acetylation of lys9 of histone 3 and reverse the hepaCAM expression through its inhibitory effect on HDACs activity in PCa LNCaP and DU145 cells; Ad-hepaCAM combined with panobinostat may synergistically inhibit the growth of LNCaP and DU145 cells, via a potential mechanism associated with the down-regulation of the expression of CCND1 and PCNA. These findings suggest that this therapeutic strategy should be further developed in clinical trials.
Answer:<|im_end|> 

The effect of HDAC1 treated with panobinostat on protein and mRNA concentration in prostate cancer cells is a decrease, as stated in the study results. Panobinostat reverses the expression of hepaCAM and inhibits HDACs activity, which results in decreased mRNA and protein expression of HDAC1, HDAC3, and HDBC4.<|im_end|>

both mRNA and protein of HDAC1 were decreased when the treating concentration of panobinostat increased.

Question:what patients were included in this study?
Context:Pregnancy outcome in women with childhood onset autoimmune hepatitis and autoimmune sclerosing cholangitis on long-term immunosuppressive treatment. Introduction: Autoimmune hepatitis and autoimmune sclerosing cholangitis may lead to maternal and fetal complications in pregnant women diagnosed during childhood and treated long-term with immunosuppressive drugs. Immunosuppressive treatment with azathioprine is usually employed during pregnancy to maintain remission but his safety is still controversial. The aim of our study is to investigate pregnancy outcomes after maternal long-term immunosuppressive treatment for autoimmune hepatitis/sclerosing cholangitis. Methods: We conducted a retrospective cohort study including all pregnant women who received a diagnosis of autoimmune hepatitis or autoimmune sclerosing cholangitis during childhood and followed-up from 1989 to 2021. Results: Fifteen pregnancies in 12 women were observed. The median follow-up from disease onset was 26.7 years. All patients had been treated with prednisone and azathioprine (AZA) as first line therapy. At the beginning of the pregnancy, 11/12 (91.6%) patients were in spontaneous or pharmacologically induced clinical and biochemical remission and one had received a liver transplant. During pregnancy, 8 patients continued azathioprine. No relapse during pregnancy occurred in any patient. One woman presented a flare five months after delivery and a second one, one year after delivery when AZA was discontinued. The 15 pregnancies resulted in 13 livebirths (86.6%) with 9 (69.2%) full-term healthy neonates. Two miscarriages (13.3%) were recorded and cesarean section was performed in 3 women (23%). No congenital malformations were observed. Conclusions: Pregnancy in women diagnosed during pediatric age with autoimmune hepatitis or autoimmune sclerosing cholangitis and treated long-term with immunosuppressants is possible with good maternal and neonatal outcomes. Azathioprine allows, in most cases, to maintain remission with a good safety profile. Careful monitoring of these patients during pregnancy is, however, mandatory.

Question:Does the study explain why the  treatment with vasoactive intestinal peptide ameliorates the blood brain barrier function?
Context:Protection of Vasoactive Intestinal Peptide on the Blood-Brain Barrier Dysfunction Induced by Focal Cerebral Ischemia in Rats. Objective: To investigate the effects of vasoactive intestinal peptide on the blood brain barrier function after focal cerebral ischemia in rats. Materials and methods: Rats were intracerebroventricular injected with vasoactive intestinal peptide after a two hours middle cerebral artery occlusion. Functional outcome was studied with the neurological severity score. The brain edema and the infarction were evaluated via histology. The blood brain barrier permeability was assessed using Evans Blue dye injection method. We also measure the apoptosis of brain microvascular endothelial cells and brain levels of B-cell leukemia-2 protein by immunohistochemical analysis and western blotting, respectively. Results: In contrast to the cases treated with vehicle at 72 h after middle cerebral artery occlusion, the treatment with vasoactive intestinal peptide significantly (P < 0.05) reduced the neurological severity score, the brain edema and infarct volume. The Evans Blue leakage and brain water content were obviously reduced (P < 0.05) in vasoactive intestinal peptide-treated rats compared with those of control rats at 72 and 96 h after stroke. In addition, vasoactive intestinal peptide decreased the numbers of terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP-nick end labeling positive endothelial cells and increased the protein levels of B-cell leukemia-2 in the ischemic hemisphere at 72 h after ischemia. Conclusions: Our data suggest that treatment with vasoactive intestinal peptide ameliorates the blood brain barrier function, contributing to reduce in brain damage both morphologically and functionally in the ischemic rat. This amelioration may be associated with attenuation in apoptosis of brain microvascular endothelial cells by increased B-cell leukemia-2 expression.

Question:Does the study provide data about the QRS interval and PR interval prolongation in cannabis hyperemesis syndrome patients exposed to antiemetics?
Context:QTc prolongation in cannabis hyperemesis syndrome patients exposed to antiemetics: A retrospective chart review. Objective: To evaluate the risk of QT prolongation in patients treated for Cannabis Hyperemesis Syndrome (CHS) in the emergency department. Methods: This was a retrospective comprehensive chart review of patients in the University of Colorado Health Emergency Department. Charts were identified by ICD9/10 codes from January 1, 2012 to December 31, 2014 for cannabis use and data were manually abstracted. We performed chi-square and odds ratios, stratified by drug, to determine differences in medication induced QTc prolongation and performed logistic regression to predict prolongation greater than 500 ms. We captured adverse events from medications as a secondary outcome. Results: We found 282 cases of CHS during the study period. There were no significant differences between the median post-medication QTc value stratified by drug when all medications were analyzed simultaneously. A multiple logistic regression model showed that only a potassium below 3.0 mmol/L predicted QT prolongation greater than 500 msec. Conclusion: Anti-emetics used to treat CHS did not result in significant QTC prolongation in this cohort.

Question:Is this a case study?
Context:Refractory CIDP successfully treated with autologous haematopoietic stem cell transplantation in a patient with monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS) and rheumatoid arthritis. Autologous haematopoietic stem cell transplantation is an emerging treatment option in refractory chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyradiculoneuropathy. We describe a case of a 46-year-old male, with history of IgG/lambda monoclonal gammopathy, who was diagnosed with chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyradiculoneuropathy at 27 years of age. After an initial 10-year period of corticotherapy response, the patient experienced severe relapses and disease progression, evolving to a refractory state. First-line and escalating treatment could not achieve clinical stabilization, leading to severe disability. Pre-treatment with ibrutinib was initiated and autologous haematopoietic stem cell transplantation was performed without significant complications. Marked clinical improvement was observed in the following months, both subjective and objective. A significant proportion of the patients who respond to the first-line immunosuppressive therapy eventually become treatment-refractory. Autologous haematopoietic stem cell transplantation may be a treatment option, offering long-term remission with an overall acceptable side effect and risk profile.

Question:Was the graft  successfully preserved after coverage with a free latissimus dorsi musculocutaneous (LDM) flap?
Context:Salvage of Prosthetic Vascular Graft Infection in the Distal Thigh Using Free Latissimus Dorsi Musculocutaneous Flap: A Case Report. Background: Prosthetic vascular graft infection (PVGI) in the distal thigh is a rare wound; thus, little is known about which muscle flaps are the most useful and cause less lower extremity morbidity in such cases. Moreover, very few reliable muscle flaps are available around the distal thigh. Case Report: We report the case of a 72-year-old woman suffering from a distal thigh wound with PVGI. The graft was successfully preserved after coverage with a free latissimus dorsi musculocutaneous (LDM) flap. Conclusions: The free LDM flap procedure is more challenging than local muscle flaps; however, a free LDM flap can be a feasible option for a distal thigh wound with PVGI with the advantage of the maintenance of walking capability by preserving the lower-limb muscles.

Question:Was the graft  successfully preserved after coverage with a free latissimus dorsi musculocutaneous (LDM) flap?
Context:Salvage of Prosthetic Vascular Graft Infection in the Distal Thigh Using Free Latissimus Dorsi Musculocutaneous Flap: A Case Report. Background: Prosthetic vascular graft infection (PVGI) in the distal thigh is a rare wound; thus, little is known about which muscle flaps are the most useful and cause less lower extremity morbidity in such cases. Moreover, very few reliable muscle flaps are available around the distal thigh. Case Report: We report the case of a 72-year-old woman suffering from a distal thigh wound with PVGI. The graft was successfully preserved after coverage with a free latissimus dorsi musculocutaneous (LDM) flap. Conclusions: The free LDM flap procedure is more challenging than local muscle flaps; however, a free LDM flap can be a feasible option for a distal thigh wound with PVGI with the advantage of the maintenance of walking capability by preserving the lower-limb muscles.

Question:Why sirtuin 6 was decreased in STZ-induced diabetic renal outer medulla?
Context:Sirtuin 6 affects glucose reabsorption and gluconeogenesis in type 1 diabetes via FoxO1. Aim: The purpose of this study was to explore the expression changes of Sirtuin 6 in diabetic renal tissues and the molecular mechanisms affecting renal tubular gluconeogenesis and reabsorption. Methods: The type 1 diabetic C57BL/6 mice model as well as high glucose cultured proximal tubular cells and cell lines were established. Sirt6 siRNA, the SGLT2 inhibitor (dapagliflozin), and insulin were pre-treated to make Sirtuin 6 levels, gluconeogenesis, and reabsorption changes. Immunofluorescence was used for Sirtuin 6 renal localization, and molecular biological detection was adopted for transcription factors, FoxO1, transporters (SGLT2 and GLUT2) as well as rate-limiting enzyme. Nuclear/plasma proteins were extracted to detect Sirtuin 6 and FoxO1 levels in the subcellular structure. Results: Sirtuin 6 was decreased in STZ-induced diabetic renal outer medulla, and lower both in high glucose-induced primary proximal tubular cells and cell lines. Sirtuin 6 reversed the glucose reabsorption and gluconeogenesis effect via regulating FoxO1 and affecting nuclear translocation of FoxO1 in high glucose-induced proximal tubular cells. Conclusion: Sirtuin 6 affects renal glucose reabsorption and gluconeogenesis in type 1 diabetes by regulating FoxO1 nuclear import.
Answer:<|im_end|> 

In the context provided, Sirtuin 6 was decreased in STZ-induced diabetic renal outer medulla because it regulates glucose reabsorption and gluconeogenesis in type 1 diabetes via FoxO1.<|im_end|>

Question:Was Fentanyl administered intravenously with Haloperidol and Ketamine administered orally?
Context:Sub dissociative dose of ketamine with haloperidol versus fentanyl on pain reduction in patients with acute pain in the emergency department; a randomized clinical trial. Background: Ketamine is known to be an effective factor in reducing pain without significant side effects. Objective: One of the limited side effects of Ketamine is agitation. Due to the reduction of this symptom with Haloperidol, we decided to design a randomized clinical trial to compare the analgesic effect of Ketamine with Haloperidol and Fentanyl in reducing acute pain and its complications. Methods: In this study, 200 adult patients who presented to the emergency department with acute pain are examined. They are randomly divided into two groups. One group received intravenous Ketamine with Haloperidol and the other group received intravenous Fentanyl. Patients are then compared for their pain score before and after administration of the drugs, as well as the side effects they experienced. Results: There was no significant difference between the mean scores of initial pain in the two groups, but at all intervals of 5, 10, 15 and 30 min after injection, the mean of pain scores of patients in the group receiving Ketamine and Haloperidol were lower. The need for injection of rescue analgesic was 9% in the Ketamine and Haloperidol group and 34% in the Fentanyl group. The mean agitation score did not differ between the two groups except in the tenth minute. At tenth minute, the mean agitation score of the Ketamine group was higher. Conclusion: Ketamine works better than fentanyl in controlling acute pain, and limited side effect of agitation can be controlled if injected with haloperidol. Due to its better function and fewer side effects, it seems that in controlling acute pain, Ketamine along with Haloperidol can be a good alternative to opioids.
Answer:<|im_end|> 
No, Fentanyl was not administered intravenously with Haloperidol and Ketamine administered orally.<|im_end|>

Question:Were polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) filters placed in four locations in each patient's room and left in the rooms for a three-hour period?
Context:The Aerosolization of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2): Phase I. Introduction: The degree to which Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is aerosolized has yet to be determined. The aim of this study is to prove methods of detection of aerosolization of SARS-CoV-2 in hospitalized patients in anticipation of testing for aerosolization in procedural and operative settings. Methods: In this prospective study, inpatients with SARS-CoV-2 were identified. Demographic information was obtained, and a symptom questionnaire was completed. Polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) filters, which were attached to an air pump, were used to detect viral aerosolization and placed in four locations in each patient's room. The filters were left in the rooms for a three-hour period. Results: There were 10 patients who enrolled in the study, none of whom were vaccinated. Only two patients were more than a week from the onset of symptoms, and half of the patients received treatment for COVID with antivirals and steroids. Among ten RT-PCR positive and hospitalized patients, and four filters per patient, there was only one positive SARS-CoV-2 aerosol sample, and it was directly attached to one of the patients. Overall, there was no correlation between symptoms or symptom onset and aerosolized test result. Conclusions: The results of this suggest that there is limited aerosolization of SARS-CoV-2 and provided proof of concept for this filter sampling technique. Further studies with increased sample size should be performed in a procedural and operative setting to provide more information about SARS-CoV-2 aerosolization.

Question:Did modifying institutional clinical practice guidelines (CPGs) to discontinue antibiotics bring positive effects?
Context:The Utility of Discharge Antibiotics in Pediatric Perforated Appendicitis Without Leukocytosis. Introduction: Optimal management of pediatric perforated appendicitis remains a topic of active investigation. Our institutional clinical practice guidelines (CPGs) were modified to discontinue antibiotics on discharge for patients with normal white blood cell count (WBC) without left shift. We hypothesized that patients would receive fewer antibiotics without increased complications. Methods: Patients <18 y old with perforated appendicitis who underwent laparoscopic appendectomy between November 1, 2016 and May 31, 2021 at a tertiary care children's hospital were included. Primary outcome was adverse events: postdischarge surgical site infection (SSI), 30-day emergency department (ED) visits, or readmissions. Outcomes were compared before and after CPG modification. Multivariable regression was performed to identify factors associated with SSI. Results: There were 113 patients pre- and 97 patients post-CPG modification. 23.1% of patients in the pre-cohort had an elevated discharge WBC or left shift compared to 18.9% of patients in the post-cohort (P = 0.48). Significantly fewer patients were prescribed antibiotics on discharge in the post-cohort (70.8% pre versus 14.4% post, P < 0.0001) and for fewer days (2 pre versus 0 post, P < 0.0001). Total antibiotic days decreased significantly (6.1 pre versus 4.6 post, P < 0.0001). There was an increase in postdischarge SSIs on univariate analysis (1.8% pre versus 9.3% post, P = 0.03), ED visits (9.7% pre versus 19.6% post, P = 0.04), and readmissions (5.3% pre versus 11.3% post, P = 0.13). On multivariable analysis, being in the post-cohort was not significantly associated with post-discharge SSIs after adjusting for sex, symptom duration, initial WBC, and discharge antibiotic duration (OR 0.25, 95% CI 0.04-1.4, P = 0.11). Conclusions: Modification of a pediatric perforated appendicitis clinical practice guideline to discontinue antibiotics on discharge with a normal WBC without left shift was effective in decreasing antibiotic duration. This was associated with an increase in SSIs on univariate analysis, which did not persist on multivariable analysis and requires further investigation.
Answer:<|im_end|>

Question:Was it found that lipoxygenase-5 and cyclooxygenase-2 pathways are involved in inflammatory processes, which would result in benign prostatic hyperplasia amelioration?
Context:The bioactive alkaloids identified from Cortex Phellodendri ameliorate benign prostatic hyperplasia via LOX-5/COX-2 pathways. Background: The bioactive alkaloids identified from Cortex Phellodendri (CP) were highly effective in treating rats with benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). Specifically, lipoxygenase-5 (LOX-5) and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) were identified as two primary targets for alleviating inflammation in BPH rats. However, it remains unknown whether the alkaloid components in CP can interact with the two target proteins. Purpose: To further identify bioactive alkaloids targeting LOX/COX pathways. Methods: An affinity-ultrafiltration mass spectrometry approach was employed to screen dual-target LOX-5/COX-2 ligands from alkaloid extract. The structures of bioactive alkaloids were characterized by high-resolution Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry. To understand the molecular mechanisms underlying the effects of bioactive alkaloids, the expression levels of LOX-5 and COX-2 in BPH model rats were investigated at both protein and mRNA levels. The LOX-5/COX-2 enzymes activity experiments and molecular docking analysis were performed to fully evaluate the interactions between bioactive alkaloids and LOX-5/COX-2. Results: After comprehensive analysis, the results showed that bioactive alkaloids could suppress the expression of LOX-5 and COX-2 simultaneously to exert an anti-inflammatory effect on the progression of BPH. In addition, the screened protoberberine, demethyleneberberine was found to exhibit prominent inhibitory activities against both LOX-5 and COX-2 enzymes, palmatine and berberine with moderate inhibitory activities. Molecular docking analysis confirmed that demethyleneberberine could interact well with LOX-5/COX-2. Conclusion: This study is the first to explore the inhibitory effects of bioactive alkaloids from CP on LOX-5 and COX-2 activities in BPH rats. Our findings demonstrate that the bioactive alkaloids from CP can ameliorate BPH via dual LOX-5/COX-2 pathways, which serves as an efficient approach for the discovery of novel drug leads from natural products with reduced side effects.

Question:Was it found that lipoxygenase-5 and cyclooxygenase-2 pathways are involved in inflammatory processes, which would result in benign prostatic hyperplasia amelioration?
Context:The bioactive alkaloids identified from Cortex Phellodendri ameliorate benign prostatic hyperplasia via LOX-5/COX-2 pathways. Background: The bioactive alkaloids identified from Cortex Phellodendri (CP) were highly effective in treating rats with benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). Specifically, lipoxygenase-5 (LOX-5) and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) were identified as two primary targets for alleviating inflammation in BPH rats. However, it remains unknown whether the alkaloid components in CP can interact with the two target proteins. Purpose: To further identify bioactive alkaloids targeting LOX/COX pathways. Methods: An affinity-ultrafiltration mass spectrometry approach was employed to screen dual-target LOX-5/COX-2 ligands from alkaloid extract. The structures of bioactive alkaloids were characterized by high-resolution Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry. To understand the molecular mechanisms underlying the effects of bioactive alkaloids, the expression levels of LOX-5 and COX-2 in BPH model rats were investigated at both protein and mRNA levels. The LOX-5/COX-2 enzymes activity experiments and molecular docking analysis were performed to fully evaluate the interactions between bioactive alkaloids and LOX-5/COX-2. Results: After comprehensive analysis, the results showed that bioactive alkaloids could suppress the expression of LOX-5 and COX-2 simultaneously to exert an anti-inflammatory effect on the progression of BPH. In addition, the screened protoberberine, demethyleneberberine was found to exhibit prominent inhibitory activities against both LOX-5 and COX-2 enzymes, palmatine and berberine with moderate inhibitory activities. Molecular docking analysis confirmed that demethyleneberberine could interact well with LOX-5/COX-2. Conclusion: This study is the first to explore the inhibitory effects of bioactive alkaloids from CP on LOX-5 and COX-2 activities in BPH rats. Our findings demonstrate that the bioactive alkaloids from CP can ameliorate BPH via dual LOX-5/COX-2 pathways, which serves as an efficient approach for the discovery of novel drug leads from natural products with reduced side effects.

Question:Did enteroaggregative E. coli, atypical enteropathogenic E.coli/enterohaemorrhagic E. coli and typical enteropathogenic E.coli detected at baseline affect sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine treatment?
Context:The positive effect of malaria IPTp-SP on birthweight is mediated by gestational weight gain but modifiable by maternal carriage of enteric pathogens. Background: Poor pregnancy and birth outcomes are common in sub-Saharan Africa and have complex aetiologies. Sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (SP), given for intermittent preventive therapy of malaria in pregnancy (IPTp), is one of few existing interventions that improves outcomes of both mother and baby despite widespread SP-resistant malaria. Compelling evidence exists that malaria-independent pathways contribute to this protective effect, but the exact sources of non anti-malarial protection remained unknown. We hypothesized that the beneficial effect of SP on birthweight is mediated by SP activity on maternal factors, including increased gestational weight gain and antibiotic activity on pathogens in the maternal gut. Methods: Expectant mothers from a larger randomized control trial comparing the efficacy of IPTp-SP to IPTp with dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine (DP) were also enrolled in this sub-study study at their first antenatal care visit before commencement of IPTp (n = 105). Participants were followed monthly until delivery. Weights and mid-to-upper-arm circumferences (MUAC) were recorded. Monthly stool samples were collected and screened for five Escherichia coli pathotypes, Shigella spp., Vibrio cholerae, Salmonella, Campylobacter coli/jejuni, and three protozoa (Giardia spp., Entameba histolytica, and Cryptosporidium spp.) using previously validated molecular assays. Findings: IPTp-SP vs. IPTP-DP was associated with higher maternal gestational weight gain (GWG) and nutritional indicators (MUAC and body-mass index, BMI). GWG was found to be a mediator of the birthweight and IPTp-SP relationship, as the birthweight of SP infants, but not DP infants, varied according to maternal GWG. The burden of maternal enteric infections was high. The three most commonly observed pathogens were enteroaggregative E. coli (EAEC), atypical enteropathogenic E.coli/enterohaemorrhagic E. coli (aEPEC/EHEC), and typical enteropathogenic E.coli (tEPEC). We found that SP reduced the prevalence of EAEC in a dose-dependent manner. After 3 or more doses, SP-recipients were 90% less likely to be infected with EAEC compared to DP-recipients (ORadj = 0.07, CI95 = 0.12, 0.39, p = 0.002). Compared to DP, this coincided with higher maternal gestational weight gain (GWG) and nutritional indicators (MUAC and body-mass index, BMI). The beneficial effect of SP on maternal GWG, MUAC and BMI, was lower if SP mothers had detectable EAEC, aEPEC/EHEC, tEPEC, and LT-ETEC at baseline. Maternal EAEC and tEPEC at baseline associated with lower birthweight for babies of both SP mothers and DP mothers. When comparing IPTp regimens, the positive effect of SP on birthweight compared to DP was only observed for infants of women who did not test positive for EAEC at baseline (adjusted mean birthweight difference SP vs. DP = 156.0 g, CI95 = -18.0 g, 336.9 g, p = 0.087), though confidence intervals crossed the null. Interpretation: Our findings indicate that in pregnant Malawian women, IPTp-SP vs. IPTp-DP is consistently associated with higher MUAC, BMI, and GWG following the WHO-recommended regimen of at least 3 doses, but carriage of maternal gut pathogens before initiation of IPTp lessens this effect. Because GWG was a mediator of the association between birthweight and SP, we show that SP's previously proven positive effect on birthweight is by promoting maternal weight gain. Overall, our results present one plausible pathway SP exerts malaria-independent protection against poor birth outcomes in the context of its waning antimalarial activity and warrants further investigation.

Question:Was it found that the natural disaccharide trehalose reduced stroke occurrence and kidney damage in stroke-prone spontaneously hypertensive rat (SHRSP) fed with a low-salt stroke permissive diet?
Context:Trehalose, a natural disaccharide, reduces stroke occurrence in the stroke-prone spontaneously hypertensive rat. Cerebrovascular disease, a frequent complication of hypertension, is a major public health issue for which novel therapeutic and preventive approaches are needed. Autophagy activation is emerging as a potential therapeutic and preventive strategy toward stroke. Among usual activators of autophagy, the natural disaccharide trehalose (TRE) has been reported to be beneficial in preclinical models of neurodegenerative diseases, atherosclerosis and myocardial infarction. In this study, we tested for the first time the effects of TRE in the stroke-prone spontaneously hypertensive rat (SHRSP) fed with a high-salt stroke permissive diet (JD). We found that TRE reduced stroke occurrence and renal damage in high salt-fed SHRSP. TRE was also able to decrease systolic blood pressure. Through ex-vivo studies, we assessed the beneficial effect of TRE on the vascular function of high salt-fed SHRSP. At the molecular level, TRE restored brain autophagy and reduced mitochondrial mass, along with the improvement of mitochondrial function. The beneficial effects of TRE were associated with increased nuclear translocation of TFEB, a transcriptional activator of autophagy. Our results suggest that TRE may be considered as a natural compound efficacious for the prevention of hypertension-related target organ damage, with particular regard to stroke and renal damage.

Question:Does the study recommend the use of inhaled epoprostenol with high flow nasal oxygen because the patients that improved or stabilized following inhalation of epoprostenol had lower rates of invasive mechanical ventilation than those who did not stabilize or improve?
Context:Use of inhaled epoprostenol with high flow nasal oxygen in non-intubated patients with severe COVID-19. Purpose: Acute lung injury associated with COVID-19 contributes significantly to its morbidity and mortality. Though invasive mechanical ventilation is sometimes necessary, the use of high flow nasal oxygen may avoid the need for mechanical ventilation in some patients. For patients approaching the limits of high flow nasal oxygen support, addition of inhaled pulmonary vasodilators is becoming more common but little is known about its effects. This is the first descriptive study of a cohort of patients receiving inhaled epoprostenol with high flow nasal oxygen for COVID-19. Materials and methods: We collected clinical data from the first fifty patients to receive inhaled epoprostenol while on high flow nasal oxygen at our institution. We compared the characteristics of patients who did and did not respond to epoprostenol addition. Results: The 18 patients that did not stabilize or improve following initiation of inhaled epoprostenol had similar rates of invasive mechanical ventilation as those who improved or stabilized (50% vs 56%). Rates of mortality were not significantly different between the two groups (17% and 31%). Conclusions: In patients with COVID-19 induced hypoxemic respiratory failure, the use of inhaled epoprostenol with high flow nasal oxygen is feasible, but physiologic signs of response were not related to clinical outcomes.
