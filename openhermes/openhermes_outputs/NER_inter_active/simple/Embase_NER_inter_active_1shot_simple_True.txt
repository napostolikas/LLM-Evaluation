Please provide a detailed explanation.

The first step in identifying devices in text involves tokenizing the text. This process involves breaking down the text into individual words or phrases. After tokenizing the text, we use a part-of-speech (POS) tagger to identify the part-of-speech of each token. We then use a named entity recognition (NER) algorithm to identify entities in the text, including devices.

In the given text, we can see

Text: Cells were treated with eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) or stearic acid (SA).

{'drug': ["eicosapentaenoic acid',  'EPA", 'docosahexaenoic acid', 'DHA', "stearic acid', SA"]}

Could you infer the drugs from the text.

Text: By combining CD, NMR and computational studies, we obtained valuable models of the interactions of two peptidomimetics of SOCS1 to deepen their functional behaviors.

Output format: {'drug' : [drug1, ..., drugN]}<|im_end|> 

{'drug': ["CD", 'NMR']}<|im_end|>

The following drugs were found in the given text: 'peptidomimetics', 'SOCS1'.
