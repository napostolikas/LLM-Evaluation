Answer:<|im_end|> 

This is a multiclass problem where we must differentiate three classes: Normal, COVID-19, and HF. To do that, we will require a robust and accurate system.

The devices involved in this system could potentially include several different types of sensors and microphones, each with specialized capabilities. Additionally, there may be other devices such as computing components used to process the data and AI to perform classification and analysis. 

So, the output format would be:
