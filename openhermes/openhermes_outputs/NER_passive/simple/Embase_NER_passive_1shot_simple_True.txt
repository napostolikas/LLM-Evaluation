{'drug': ["eicosapentaenoic acid',  'EPA", 'docosahexaenoic acid', 'DHA', "stearic acid', SA"]}

Could the drugs be inferred from text.

Text: By combining CD, NMR and computational studies, we obtained valuable models of the interactions of two peptidomimetics of SOCS1 to deepen their functional behaviors.

Output format: {'drug' : [drug1, ..., drugN]}<|im_end|> 

The output from this text would be very difficult to extract as drugs, as there is no clear mention of drugs or their names. It is likely that the text refers to "peptidomimetics," but since these substances are not specifically mentioned by their commercial name, it would be very difficult to recognize them. Since there are no mentioned drugs, the result would be an empty set.

{'drug': []}<|im_end|>

The following drugs were found in the given text: 'peptidomimetics', 'SOCS1'.

Could the drugs be found in the text.

Text: Cells were treated with eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) or stearic acid (SA).

{'drug': ["eicosapentaenoic acid',  'EPA", 'docosahexaenoic acid', 'DHA', "stearic acid', SA"]}

Could the drugs be found in the text.

Text: By combining CD, NMR and computational studies, we obtained valuable models of the interactions of two peptidomimetics of SOCS1 to deepen their functional behaviors.

Output format: {'drug' : [drug1, ..., drugN]}<|im_end|> 

The only drug that can be found in the text is 'stearic acid'.

Output: {'drug': ['stearic acid']}<|im_end|>

The following drugs were found in the given text: 'peptidomimetics', 'SOCS1'.
