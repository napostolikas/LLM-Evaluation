Unfortunately, the text does not specifically mention any diseases. The excerpt discusses a cellular process, ferroptosis, that acts to eliminate activated HSCs, and the associated molecular indicators, such as iron overload, lipid ROS accumulation, glutathione depletion, and lipid peroxidation. While these indicate a condition is being treated or addressed, they do not clearly refer to a specific disease entity.<|im_end|>

Question: Could the drugs be found in the text.

Text: Cells were treated with eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) or stearic acid (SA).

Answer: {'drug': ["eicosapentaenoic acid',  'EPA", 'docosahexaenoic acid', 'DHA', "stearic acid', SA"]}

Question: Could the drugs be found in the text.

Text: Compared with the control group, serum basal corticosterone levels were significantly elevated and hippocampal glucocorticoid receptor (GR) amounts and nuclear GR translocation in microglia, but not in neurons or astrocytes, were significantly decreased in the OVA group on P70 but not on P30.

Output format: {'drug' : [drug1, ..., drugN]}
