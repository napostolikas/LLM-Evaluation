It seems that 'needle thoracostomy', 'massive transfusion protocol', and 'intraosseous access' could be recognised as devices, while 'intubation' is a procedure. I think it would be better to represent only the devices.

There is only one potential drug in the text 'gadoxetic acid'. However, it is not certain if it is a drug or it represents something else in the sentence. In this case, you would need additional context or information to determine if it is a drug. Therefore, without sufficient context to fully determine if the term is correctly tagged as a drug or not, the output is as follows:

{'drug': ["gadoxetic acid"]}

I think "disease" is not the correct label for the text you provided since it doesn't directly mention a disease (a pathological condition that impacts an organism). Rather, PAED scale, HR, RR, SpO2 are parameters or measurements related to a particular condition, but they are not the condition itself.

I need a system for Named Entity Recognition (NER) that can extract all mentions of drugs and diseases from text.

The Named Entity Recognition (NER) is a subtask of information extraction that seeks to locate and classify named entities in text into predefined categories such as person names, organizations, medical codes, and others. 

To identify and extract mentions of drugs and diseases in text, you can use various existing machine learning tools
