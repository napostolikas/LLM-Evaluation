In this text, there are no explicit mentions of drugs, but there is a reference to "FtsZ inhibitors," which are compounds designed to prevent the activity of the FtsZ protein, an essential component of bacterial cell division. These compounds could be potential antibacterial drugs. However, without more specific information about the compounds themselves, it's impossible to identify them.

Question: You give me the drugs from the text.

Text: Compared with the control group, serum basal corticosterone levels were significantly elevated and hippocampal glucocorticoid receptor (GR) amounts and nuclear GR translocation in microglia, but not in neurons or astrocytes, were significantly decreased in the OVA group on P70 but not on P30.

Output format: {'drug' : [drug1, ..., drugN]}

Answer:<|im_end|> 

The given text does not contain any drug names. Therefore, the answer is: {'drug': []}<|im_end|>

drugs: 'OVA', 'glucocorticoid receptor', 'GR',  'corticosterone'.
