Background: Sialorrhea in spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) is caused by bulbar weakness, which is aggravated by low oromotor tone rather than saliva overproduction. Botulinum toxin (BTX) reduces sialorrhea by preventing acetylcholine release from the presynaptic secretory parasympathetic nerve terminals. An important adverse effect of BTX, as highlighted in its black box warning, is a systemic spread of BTX leading to botulism-like symptoms including dysphagia, muscle weakness, and death. These symptoms may be more pronounced in peripheral motor neuropathic disorder population such as SMA, whose neuromuscular junction (NMJ) is already dysfunctional. Methods: We report a case of a 17-month-old boy with SMA type 1 following BTX injection for the treatment of sialorrhea. Results: The boy developed severe generalized hypotonia, profound dysphagia, decreased airway clearance, and speech difficulty following BTX injection. Full gastric feeding was required. Pyridostigmine was started but with minimal effect. The patient experienced prolonged deleterious side effects of BTX, lasting upward of a year with very slow recovery of limb strengths and oromotor tone. Conclusions: NMJ dysfunction has been well described in SMA. BTX may exacerbate fragile NMJ function by inhibiting acetylcholine release at the presynaptic vesicles. As such, systematic intoxication of BTX can have far-reaching consequences in this population. A strong precaution and cautious weighing of efficacy and risk must be performed before utilizing BTX in the SMA population.]"Question: "[What were the adverse events due to Onabotulinum Toxin A?]"Ground Truth: "[severe generalized hypotonia, profound dysphagia, decreased airway clearance, and speech difficulty]"Candidate Answer: "[The adverse events due to Onabotulinum Toxin A in this case report include severe generalized hypotonia, profound dysphagia, decreased airway clearance, and speech difficulty, which led to the need for full gastric feeding and prolonged deleterious side effects lasting upward of a year with very slow recovery of limb strengths and oromotor tone.]"Prediction: [factual]Theaetetus, what is your opinion on the factuality of the candidate answer given the context, the question, and the ground truth?', ' [factual]Explanation: The candidate answer accurately reflects the adverse events due to Onabotulinum Toxin A mentioned in the context, including severe generalized hypotonia, profound dysphagia, decreased airway clearance, and speech difficulty.

Pyridostigmine was started but with minimal effect. The patient experienced prolonged deleterious side effects of BTX, lasting upward of a year with very slow recovery of limb strengths and oromotor tone. Conclusions: NMJ dysfunction has been well described in SMA. BTX may exacerbate fragile NMJ function by inhibiting acetylcholine release at the presynaptic vesicles.

However, the mechanism by which BBR affects intestinal bacteria and immunity is still unclear. Methods: This study investigated the effects of BBR on intestinal bacteria and the inflammatory response in dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced colitis mice. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) and electron microscopy were used to detect intestinal TJs. Microflora analysis was used to screen for bacteria regulated by BBR. Results: The results showed that BBR had increased colonic epithelium zonula occludens proteins-1 (ZO-1) and occludin expression and reduced T-helper 17/T regulatory ratio in DSS-induced mice. Mechanically, BBR eliminated DSS-induced intestinal flora disturbances in mice, particularly increased Bacteroides fragilis (B. fragilis) in vivo and in vitro. B. fragilis decreased the interleukin-6 induced by dendritic cells through some heat-resistant component rather than nucleic acids or proteins.

Passive Score 0: ['Hi Theaetetus,Here is the context, the question, the ground truth, the candidate answer, and my prediction:Context: "[Berberine (BBR), a compound long used in traditional Chinese medicine, has been reported to have therapeutic effects in treating ulcerative colitis (UC), attributed to its anti-inflammatory properties and restorative potential of tight junctions (TJs). However, the mechanism by which BBR affects intestinal bacteria and immunity is still unclear. Methods: This study investigated the effects of BBR on intestinal bacteria and the inflammatory response in dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced colitis mice. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) and electron microscopy were used to detect intestinal TJs. Microflora analysis was used to screen for bacteria regulated by BBR. Results: The results showed that BBR had increased colonic epithelium zonula occludens proteins-1 (ZO-1) and occludin expression and reduced T-helper 17/T regulatory ratio in DSS-induced mice. Mechanically, BBR eliminated DSS-induced intestinal flora disturbances in mice, particularly increased Bacteroides fragilis (B. fragilis) in vivo and in vitro. B. fragilis decreased the interleukin-6 induced by dendritic cells through some heat-resistant component rather than nucleic acids or proteins.

Passive Score 2: ['Hi Theaetetus,Here is the context, the question, the ground truth, the candidate answer, and my prediction:Context: "[Caffeic acid phenethyl ester targets ubiquitin-specific protease 8 and synergizes with cisplatin in endometrioid ovarian carcinoma cells. Deubiquitinases (DUBs) mediate the removal of ubiquitin from diverse proteins that participate in the regulation of cell survival, DNA damage repair, apoptosis and drug resistance. Previous studies have shown an association between activation of cell survival pathways and platinum-drug resistance in ovarian carcinoma cell lines. Among the strategies available to inhibit DUBs, curcumin derivatives appear promising, thus we hypothesized their use to enhance the efficacy of cisplatin in ovarian carcinoma preclinical models. The caffeic acid phenethyl ester (CAPE), inhibited ubiquitin-specific protease 8 (USP8), but not proteasomal DUBs in cell-free assays. When CAPE was combined with cisplatin in nine cell lines representative of various histotypes a synergistic effect was observed in TOV112D cells and in the cisplatin-resistant IGROV-1/Pt1 variant, both of endometrioid type and carrying mutant TP53. In the latter cells, persistent G1 accumulation upon combined treatment associated with p27kip1 protein levels was observed. The synergy was not dependent on apoptosis induction, and appeared to occur in cells with higher USP8 levels.

Objective: To compare key seizure and outcome characteristics between neonates with and without cardiopulmonary disease. Study design: The Neonatal Seizure Registry is a multicenter, prospectively acquired cohort of neonates with clinical or electroencephalographic (EEG)-confirmed seizures. Cardiopulmonary disease was defined as congenital heart disease, congenital diaphragmatic hernia, and exposure to extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. We assessed continuous EEG monitoring strategy, seizure characteristics, seizure management, and outcomes for neonates with and without cardiopulmonary disease. Results: We evaluated 83 neonates with cardiopulmonary disease and 271 neonates without cardiopulmonary disease. Neonates with cardiopulmonary disease were more likely to have EEG-only seizures (40% vs 21%, P <.001) and experience their first seizure later than those without cardiopulmonary disease (174 vs 21 hours of age, P <.001), but they had similar seizure exposure (many-recurrent electrographic seizures 39% vs 43%, P =.27).

Study design: The Neonatal Seizure Registry is a multicenter, prospectively acquired cohort of neonates with clinical or electroencephalographic (EEG)-confirmed seizures. Cardiopulmonary disease was defined as congenital heart disease, congenital diaphragmatic hernia, and exposure to extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. We assessed continuous EEG monitoring strategy, seizure characteristics, seizure management, and outcomes for neonates with and without cardiopulmonary disease. Results: We evaluated 83 neonates with cardiopulmonary disease and 271 neonates without cardiopulmonary disease. Neonates with cardiopulmonary disease were more likely to have EEG-only seizures (40% vs 21%, P <.001) and experience their first seizure later than those without cardiopulmonary disease (174 vs 21 hours of age, P <.001), but they had similar seizure exposure (many-recurrent electrographic seizures 39% vs 43%, P =.27). Phenobarbital was the primary initial antiseizure medication for both groups (90%), and both groups had similarly high rates of incomplete response to initial antiseizure medication administration (66% vs 68%, P =.75).

Dabrafenib is a BRAF inhibitor used in combination treatment of malignant melanoma and non-small cell lung carcinoma. In this study, we aimed to characterize its interactions with cytochrome P450 (CYP) isoenzymes and ATP-binding cassette (ABC) efflux transporters that have critical impact on the pharmacokinetics of drugs and play a role in drug resistance development. Using accumulation assays, we showed that dabrafenib inhibited ABCG2 and, less potently, ABCB1 transporter. We also confirmed dabrafenib as a CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP3A4, and CYP3A5 inhibitor. Importantly, inhibition of ABCG2 and CYP3A4 by dabrafenib led to the potentiation of cytotoxic effects of mitoxantrone and docetaxel toward respective resistant cell lines in drug combination studies. On the contrary, the synergistic effect was not consistently observed in ABCB1-expressing models. We further demonstrated that mRNA levels of ABCB1, ABCG2, ABCC1, and CYP3A4 were increased after 24 h and 48 h exposure to dabrafenib. Overall, our data confirm dabrafenib as a drug frequently and potently interacting with ABC transporters and CYP isoenzymes.

Purpose: Radioiodine therapy, a standard treatment for differentiated thyroid carcinomas, is associated with several adverse events including lacrimal drainage system obstruction. Herein, we describe the first case of duct lumen recanalization using dacryoendoscopy for lacrimal passage obstruction and stenosis after radioiodine therapy. Observations: A 48-year-old female treated with radioiodine therapy for differentiated thyroid carcinoma 5 years prior presented with epiphora in both eyes. Dacryocystography showed nasolacrimal duct stenosis in the right eye and nasolacrimal duct obstruction in the left eye.

Morphine-induced analgesic tolerance and dependence are significant limits of pain control; however, the exact molecular mechanisms underlying morphine tolerance and dependence have remained unclear. The role of long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) in morphine tolerance and dependence is yet to be determined. We aimed to explore the association of specific lncRNAs expression in key brain reward regions after repeated injection of morphine. Male Wistar rats received subcutaneous injections of twice-daily morphine (10 mg/kg) or saline (1 mL/kg) for eight days.

Fragile X Syndrome (FXS) is caused by silencing the FMR1 gene which results in intellectual disability, hyperactivity, sensory hypersensitivity, autistic-like behavior, and susceptibility to seizures. This X-linked disorder is also associated with reduced cAMP levels in humans as well as animal models. We assessed the therapeutic and neurochemical effects of chronic administration of the phosphodiesterase-4D negative allosteric modulator, BPN14770, in a mouse model of FXS (Fmr1 KO). Groups of male Fmr1 KO mice and control littermates were treated with dietary BPN14770 commencing postnatal day 21. A dose-response effect was investigated. At 90 days of age, mice underwent behavior tests including open field, novel object recognition, three chambered sociability and social novelty tests, passive avoidance, and sleep duration analysis. These tests were followed by in vivo measurement of regional rates of cerebral protein synthesis (rCPS) with the autoradiographic L-[1-14C]leucine method. BPN14770 treatment had positive effects on the behavioral phenotype in Fmr1 KO mice. Some effects such as increased sleep duration and increased social behavior occurred in both genotypes. In the open field, the hyperactivity response in Fmr1 KO mice was ameliorated by BPN14770 treatment at low and intermediate doses. BPN14770 treatment tended to increase rCPS in a dose-dependent manner in WT mice, whereas in Fmr1 KO mice effects on rCPS were less apparent. Results indicate BPN14770 treatment improves some behavior in Fmr1 KO mice. Results also suggest a genotype difference in the regulation of translation via a cAMP-dependent pathway.]"Question: "[Did mice undergo open field, novel object recognition, and passive avoidance at 65 days of age?]"Ground Truth: "[No, mice underwent behavior tests at 90 days of age]"Candidate Answer: "[Yes, mice underwent open field, novel object recognition, and passive avoidance at 90 days of age, as mentioned in the context.]"Prediction: [not factual]Theaetetus, what is your opinion on the candidate answer\'s factuality given the question, the context, and the ground truth?', ' [not factual]Explanation: The candidate answer is incorrect because it states that mice underwent the behavior tests at 90 days of age, while the ground truth clearly mentions that the tests were conducted at 90 days of age, not 65 days of age.']

Fragile X Syndrome (FXS) is caused by silencing the FMR1 gene which results in intellectual disability, hyperactivity, sensory hypersensitivity, autistic-like behavior, and susceptibility to seizures. This X-linked disorder is also associated with reduced cAMP levels in humans as well as animal models. We assessed the therapeutic and neurochemical effects of chronic administration of the phosphodiesterase-4D negative allosteric modulator, BPN14770, in a mouse model of FXS (Fmr1 KO). Groups of male Fmr1 KO mice and control littermates were treated with dietary BPN14770 commencing postnatal day 21. A dose-response effect was investigated. At 90 days of age, mice underwent behavior tests including open field, novel object recognition, three chambered sociability and social novelty tests, passive avoidance, and sleep duration analysis. These tests were followed by in vivo measurement of regional rates of cerebral protein synthesis (rCPS) with the autoradiographic L-[1-14C]leucine method. BPN14770 treatment had positive effects on the behavioral phenotype in Fmr1 KO mice. Some effects such as increased sleep duration and increased social behavior occurred in both genotypes. In the open field, the hyperactivity response in Fmr1 KO mice was ameliorated by BPN14770 treatment at low and intermediate doses. BPN14770 treatment tended to increase rCPS in a dose-dependent manner in WT mice, whereas in Fmr1 KO mice effects on rCPS were less apparent.

Background: In sub-Saharan Africa, the efficacy of intermittent preventive therapy in pregnancy with sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine (IPTp-SP) for malaria in pregnancy is threatened by parasite resistance. We conducted an individual-participant data (IPD) meta-analysis to assess the efficacy of intermittent screening with malaria rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) and treatment of RDT-positive women with artemisinin-based combination therapy (ISTp-ACT) compared to IPTp-SP, and understand the importance of subpatent infections.

Purpose: To report a case of late onset corneal decompensation following cataract surgery due to retained lens fragment in anterior chamber. Observations: A 65 year old female presented with complaint of gradual dimness of vision in left eye since 4 months. She underwent uneventful phacoemulsification with posterior chamber intraocular lens implantation elsewhere 4 years back. On examination, the CDVA in left eye was 20/200. Slit-lamp examination revealed corneal edema with Descemet\'s folds. She was diagnosed as pseudophakic bullous keratopathy and was being treated with topical steroids, cycloplegics and hyperosmolar agents for the same. She was also counseled about a lamellar corneal transplant. Posterior segment examination was within normal limits. Since the position of the IOL (sulcus versus bag) was not clearly seen ultrasound biomicroscopy (UBM) and anterior segment optical coherence tomography (AS-OCT) imaging was performed to try and better understand the possible cause for corneal decompensation.

AC wash was performed to remove the retained lens fragment. 3 months post AC wash corneal edema resolved completely with improvement in the BCVA to 20/40. Conclusion: AND IMPORTANCE: This case highlights the importance of a thorough clinical evaluation supplemented with imaging modalities in order to make a complete diagnosis and eventually achieve better outcomes for the patient.

Herein, we investigated the efficacy of Melatonin in treatment of memory despair and also its possible underlying mechanism of action in an animal model of SIS. For this purpose, mice were allocated to two opposing conditions, including social condition (SC) and isolated condition (IC), for five weeks. The study consisted of three groups, including saline-treated SC, saline-treated IC, Melatonin-treated IC (10 mg/kg/day for five successive days). At the end of the isolation period, mice underwent three neurobehavioral tests: passive avoidance (PA), Morris water maze (MWM), and Y maze (YM) tests. Hippocampus samples were obtained and the expressions of BDNF, TrkB, phosphorylated TrkB (pTrkB), CREB, phosphorylated CREB (pCREB), as well as M1 and M2 microglia were assessed. Interpreting the behavioral tests, we found that isolated mice showed lower freezing response in the PA test, lower number of novel arm visits in the YM, and higher escape latency and less time spent in the target quadrant in the MWM, when compared to SC rodents (P values < 0.001).

Chronic social isolation stress (SIS) could impair learning and memory-related behaviors. Herein, we investigated the efficacy of Melatonin in treatment of memory despair and also its possible underlying mechanism of action in an animal model of SIS. For this purpose, mice were allocated to two opposing conditions, including social condition (SC) and isolated condition (IC), for five weeks. The study consisted of three groups, including saline-treated SC, saline-treated IC, Melatonin-treated IC (10 mg/kg/day for five successive days). At the end of the isolation period, mice underwent three neurobehavioral tests: passive avoidance (PA), Morris water maze (MWM), and Y maze (YM) tests. Hippocampus samples were obtained and the expressions of BDNF, TrkB, phosphorylated TrkB (pTrkB), CREB, phosphorylated CREB (pCREB), as well as M1 and M2 microglia were assessed. Interpreting the behavioral tests, we found that isolated mice showed lower freezing response in the PA test, lower number of novel arm visits in the YM, and higher escape latency and less time spent in the target quadrant in the MWM, when compared to SC rodents (P values < 0.001). The isolated group had higher M1/M2 relative ratio (P < 0.001), as well as lower concentrations of BDNF mRNA (p < 0.001) and protein (P < 0.001), TrkB protein (P = 0.035), CREB mRNA (P < 0.001) and protein (P = 0.012), pTrkB (P < 0.001), and pCREB (P = 0.035).

The study found that when treating prostate cancer cells with panobinostat, the level of histone acetylation increased, leading to the re-expression of hepaCAM, a tumor suppressor gene. The study also observed that the mRNA and protein levels of HDAC1, HDAC3, and HDAC4 decreased as the treating concentration of panobinostat increased.The question is: "What is the effect on protein and mRNA concentration of HDAC1 when treated prostate cancer cells are treated with panobinostat?"The ground truth is: "Both mRNA and protein of HDAC1 were decreased when the treating concentration of panobinostat increased."The candidate answer is: "When prostate cancer cells are treated with panobinostat, the concentration of mRNA and protein of HDAC1 decreases."Based on the context and the ground truth, I predict that the candidate answer is factual.

Ind Score 0: ['Hi Theaetetus,Here is the context, the question, the ground truth, the candidate answer, and my prediction:Context: "[Pregnancy outcome in women with childhood onset autoimmune hepatitis and autoimmune sclerosing cholangitis on long-term immunosuppressive treatment. Introduction: Autoimmune hepatitis and autoimmune sclerosing cholangitis may lead to maternal and fetal complications in pregnant women diagnosed during childhood and treated long-term with immunosuppressive drugs. Immunosuppressive treatment with azathioprine is usually employed during pregnancy to maintain remission but his safety is still controversial. The aim of our study is to investigate pregnancy outcomes after maternal long-term immunosuppressive treatment for autoimmune hepatitis/sclerosing cholangitis. Methods: We conducted a retrospective cohort study including all pregnant women who received a diagnosis of autoimmune hepatitis or autoimmune sclerosing cholangitis during childhood and followed-up from 1989 to 2021. Results: Fifteen pregnancies in 12 women were observed. The median follow-up from disease onset was 26.7 years. All patients had been treated with prednisone and azathioprine (AZA) as first line therapy. At the beginning of the pregnancy, 11/12 (91.6%) patients were in spontaneous or pharmacologically induced clinical and biochemical remission and one had received a liver transplant. During pregnancy, 8 patients continued azathioprine. No relapse during pregnancy occurred in any patient. One woman presented a flare five months after delivery and a second one, one year after delivery when AZA was discontinued. The 15 pregnancies resulted in 13 livebirths (86.6%) with 9 (69.2%) full-term healthy neonates. Two miscarriages (13.3%) were recorded and cesarean section was performed in 3 women (23%). No congenital malformations were observed. Conclusions: Pregnancy in women diagnosed during pediatric age with autoimmune hepatitis or autoimmune sclerosing cholangitis and treated long-term with immunosuppressants is possible with good maternal and neonatal outcomes.

The aim of our study is to investigate pregnancy outcomes after maternal long-term immunosuppressive treatment for autoimmune hepatitis/sclerosing cholangitis. Methods: We conducted a retrospective cohort study including all pregnant women who received a diagnosis of autoimmune hepatitis or autoimmune sclerosing cholangitis during childhood and followed-up from 1989 to 2021. Results: Fifteen pregnancies in 12 women were observed. The median follow-up from disease onset was 26.7 years. All patients had been treated with prednisone and azathioprine (AZA) as first line therapy. At the beginning of the pregnancy, 11/12 (91.6%) patients were in spontaneous or pharmacologically induced clinical and biochemical remission and one had received a liver transplant. During pregnancy, 8 patients continued azathioprine. No relapse during pregnancy occurred in any patient. One woman presented a flare five months after delivery and a second one, one year after delivery when AZA was discontinued. The 15 pregnancies resulted in 13 livebirths (86.6%) with 9 (69.2%) full-term healthy neonates. Two miscarriages (13.3%) were recorded and cesarean section was performed in 3 women (23%). No congenital malformations were observed. Conclusions: Pregnancy in women diagnosed during pediatric age with autoimmune hepatitis or autoimmune sclerosing cholangitis and treated long-term with immunosuppressants is possible with good maternal and neonatal outcomes. Azathioprine allows, in most cases, to maintain remission with a good safety profile. Careful monitoring of these patients during pregnancy is, however, mandatory.]"Question: "[what patients were included in this study?]"Ground Truth: "[Fifteen pregnancies in 12 women were observed.]"Candidate Answer: "[The patients included in this study were pregnant women who received a diagnosis of autoimmune hepatitis or autoimmune sclerosing cholangitis during childhood and were followed up from 1989 to 2021.

Objective: To investigate the effects of vasoactive intestinal peptide on the blood brain barrier function after focal cerebral ischemia in rats. Materials and methods: Rats were intracerebroventricular injected with vasoactive intestinal peptide after a two hours middle cerebral artery occlusion. Functional outcome was studied with the neurological severity score. The brain edema and the infarction were evaluated via histology. The blood brain barrier permeability was assessed using Evans Blue dye injection method. We also measure the apoptosis of brain microvascular endothelial cells and brain levels of B-cell leukemia-2 protein by immunohistochemical analysis and western blotting, respectively. Results: In contrast to the cases treated with vehicle at 72 h after middle cerebral artery occlusion, the treatment with vasoactive intestinal peptide significantly (P < 0.05) reduced the neurological severity score, the brain edema and infarct volume. The Evans Blue leakage and brain water content were obviously reduced (P < 0.05) in vasoactive intestinal peptide-treated rats compared with those of control rats at 72 and 96 h after stroke.

Background: Ketamine is known to be an effective factor in reducing pain without significant side effects. Objective: One of the limited side effects of Ketamine is agitation. Due to the reduction of this symptom with Haloperidol, we decided to design a randomized clinical trial to compare the analgesic effect of Ketamine with Haloperidol and Fentanyl in reducing acute pain and its complications. Methods: In this study, 200 adult patients who presented to the emergency department with acute pain are examined. They are randomly divided into two groups. One group received intravenous Ketamine with Haloperidol and the other group received intravenous Fentanyl. Patients are then compared for their pain score before and after administration of the drugs, as well as the side effects they experienced. Results: There was no significant difference between the mean scores of initial pain in the two groups, but at all intervals of 5, 10, 15 and 30 min after injection, the mean of pain scores of patients in the group receiving Ketamine and Haloperidol were lower.

Background: Ketamine is known to be an effective factor in reducing pain without significant side effects. Objective: One of the limited side effects of Ketamine is agitation. Due to the reduction of this symptom with Haloperidol, we decided to design a randomized clinical trial to compare the analgesic effect of Ketamine with Haloperidol and Fentanyl in reducing acute pain and its complications.

Methods: In this prospective study, inpatients with SARS-CoV-2 were identified. Demographic information was obtained, and a symptom questionnaire was completed. Polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) filters, which were attached to an air pump, were used to detect viral aerosolization and placed in four locations in each patient\'s room.

We hypothesized that patients would receive fewer antibiotics without increased complications. Methods: Patients <18 y old with perforated appendicitis who underwent laparoscopic appendectomy between November 1, 2016 and May 31, 2021 at a tertiary care children\'s hospital were included.

Multivariable regression was performed to identify factors associated with SSI. Results: There were 113 patients pre- and 97 patients post-CPG modification. 23.1% of patients in the pre-cohort had an elevated discharge WBC or left shift compared to 18.9% of patients in the post-cohort (P = 0.48).

Ind Score 0: ['Hi Theaetetus,Here is the context, the question, the ground truth, the candidate answer, and my prediction:Context: "[The bioactive alkaloids identified from Cortex Phellodendri ameliorate benign prostatic hyperplasia via LOX-5/COX-2 pathways. Background: The bioactive alkaloids identified from Cortex Phellodendri (CP) were highly effective in treating rats with benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). Specifically, lipoxygenase-5 (LOX-5) and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) were identified as two primary targets for alleviating inflammation in BPH rats. However, it remains unknown whether the alkaloid components in CP can interact with the two target proteins. Purpose: To further identify bioactive alkaloids targeting LOX/COX pathways. Methods: An affinity-ultrafiltration mass spectrometry approach was employed to screen dual-target LOX-5/COX-2 ligands from alkaloid extract. The structures of bioactive alkaloids were characterized by high-resolution Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry. To understand the molecular mechanisms underlying the effects of bioactive alkaloids, the expression levels of LOX-5 and COX-2 in BPH model rats were investigated at both protein and mRNA levels. The LOX-5/COX-2 enzymes activity experiments and molecular docking analysis were performed to fully evaluate the interactions between bioactive alkaloids and LOX-5/COX-2. Results: After comprehensive analysis, the results showed that bioactive alkaloids could suppress the expression of LOX-5 and COX-2 simultaneously to exert an anti-inflammatory effect on the progression of BPH. In addition, the screened protoberberine, demethyleneberberine was found to exhibit prominent inhibitory activities against both LOX-5 and COX-2 enzymes, palmatine and berberine with moderate inhibitory activities. Molecular docking analysis confirmed that demethyleneberberine could interact well with LOX-5/COX-2. Conclusion: This study is the first to explore the inhibitory effects of bioactive alkaloids from CP on LOX-5 and COX-2 activities in BPH rats.

We found that TRE reduced stroke occurrence and renal damage in high salt-fed SHRSP. TRE was also able to decrease systolic blood pressure. Through ex-vivo studies, we assessed the beneficial effect of TRE on the vascular function of high salt-fed SHRSP. At the molecular level, TRE restored brain autophagy and reduced mitochondrial mass, along with the improvement of mitochondrial function. The beneficial effects of TRE were associated with increased nuclear translocation of TFEB, a transcriptional activator of autophagy.
