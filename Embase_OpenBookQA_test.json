One year later, several hundred diabetic patients were treated in Canada and the United States of America by this hormone changing the clinical spectrum of diabetes. The quick progress from impure pancreatic extracts to an active and safe insulin was obtained through a cooperation, under the aegis of the Insulin Committee of the Toronto University, between the clinicians of the General Hospital of Toronto (Canada), the Department of Physiology of the University of Toronto (Connaught Laboratories) and the US pharmacological industry (Eli-Lilly Company), who achieved a better purification of the extracts permitting large scale production.

            "context": "7-Hydroxycoumarin mitigates the severity of collagen-induced arthritis in rats by inhibiting proliferation and inducing apoptosis of fibroblast-like synoviocytes via suppression of Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signaling pathway. Background: 7-Hydroxycoumarin (7-HC) as a coumarin compound is widely found in Chinese herbs and exhibits diverse biological activities. Promoting cell apoptosis of fibroblast-like synoviocytes (FLS) is a meaningful strategy for rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Though the protective effect of 7-HC on RA experimental models has been reported, the specific mechanisms, especially the possible relationships of this effect to regulating FLS proliferation and apoptosis, still need clarification. Purpose: This study clarified the therapeutic effects of 7-HC on collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) in rats and explored the underlying mechanisms. Methods: In vivo, 7-HC (15, 30 or 60 mg/kg) was intraperitoneally given to CIA rats, and its therapeutic effect and anti-inflammatory activity were evaluated. Ki67 immunohistochemistry, TUNEL assay and synovial proteins detection were conducted. In vitro, after treating with 7-HC (20, 40 or 80 \u03bcM) in TNF-\u03b1-stimulated RA FLS (MH7A cell line), cell proliferation and apoptosis were examined. The involvement of Wnt/\u03b2-catenin pathway was checked in vivo and in vitro. Results: 7-HC attenuated the severity of rat CIA, evidenced by the reduction of paw swelling, arthritis index, joint damage, collagen type II antibody serum level, and IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, TNF-\u03b1 production in serum and synovium. Particularly, 7-HC in vivo had anti-proliferative and pro-apoptotic effects on CIA rat synovial cells, indicated by reduced synovial Ki67 expression, raised synovial apoptosis index, decreased Bcl-2 protein level and increased level of Bax and cleaved caspase 3 protein. Further, 7-HC in vitro suppressed proliferation and promoted apoptosis of TNF-\u03b1-stimulated MH7A cells by regulating the mitochondrial pathway. Mechanistically, 7-HC treatment inhibited Wnt/\u03b2-catenin pathway, suggested by the reduction of pathway-related proteins (e.g. Wnt1, LRP6, p-GSK-3\u03b2 (Ser9), \u03b2-catenin, cyclin D1 and c-Myc), the recovery of GSK-3\u03b2 activity and the inhibition of \u03b2-catenin nuclear translocation. As expected, combined use of lithium chloride, an activator of Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signaling, reversed the anti-proliferative and pro-apoptotic effects of 7-HC in vitro. Conclusion: 7-HC relieved the severity of rat CIA by inhibiting cell proliferation and inducing apoptosis of rheumatoid FLS via inhibition of Wnt/\u03b2-catenin pathway.",

Background: Sialorrhea in spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) is caused by bulbar weakness, which is aggravated by low oromotor tone rather than saliva overproduction. Botulinum toxin (BTX) reduces sialorrhea by preventing acetylcholine release from the presynaptic secretory parasympathetic nerve terminals. An important adverse effect of BTX, as highlighted in its black box warning, is a systemic spread of BTX leading to botulismlike symptoms including dysphagia, muscle weakness, and death. These symptoms may be more pronounced in peripheral motor neuropathic disorder population such as SMA, whose neuromuscular junction (NMJ) is already dysfunctional. Methods: We report a case of a 17-month-old boy with SMA type 1 following BTX injection for the treatment of sialorrhea. Results: The boy developed severe generalized hypotonia, profound dysphagia, decreased airway clearance, and speech difficulty following BTX injection. Full gastric feeding was required. Pyridostigmine was started but with minimal effect. The patient experienced prolonged deleterious side effects of BTX, lasting upward of a year with very slow recovery of limb strengths and oromotor tone. Conclusions: NMJ dysfunction has been well described in SMA. BTX may exacerbate fragile NMJ function by inhibiting acetylcholine release at the presynaptic vesicles. As such, systematic intoxication of BTX can have far-reaching consequences in this population. A strong precaution and cautious weighing of efficacy and risk must be performed before utilizing BTX in the SMA population.",

Background: New influenza vaccines are needed to increase vaccine efficacy. Adjuvants may allow hemagglutinin (HA) dose-sparing with enhanced immunogenicity. MAS-1 is an investigational low viscosity, free-flowing, water-in-oil emulsion-based adjuvant/delivery system comprised of stable nanoglobular aqueous droplets. Methods: A phase 1, double-blind, safety and immunogenicity, HA dose escalation, randomized clinical trial was conducted. MAS-1 adjuvant with 1, 3, 5 or 9 \u00b5g per HA derived from licensed seasonal trivalent high dose inactivated influenza vaccine (IIV, Fluzone HD 60 \u00b5g per HA) in a 0.3 mL dose were compared to standard dose IIV (Fluzone SD, 15 \u00b5g per HA). Safety was measured by reactogenicity, adverse events, and clinical laboratory tests. Serum hemagglutination inhibition (HAI) antibody titers were measured for immunogenicity. Results: Seventy-two subjects, aged 18\u201347 years, received one dose of either 0.3 mL adjuvanted vaccine or SD IIV intramuscularly. Common injection site and systemic reactions post-vaccination were mild tenderness, induration, pain, headache, myalgia, malaise and fatigue. All reactions resolved within 14 days post-vaccination. Safety laboratory measures were not different between groups. Geometric mean antibody titers, geometric mean fold increases in antibody titer, seroconversion rates and seroprotection rates against vaccine strains were in general higher and of longer duration (day 85 and 169 visits) with MAS-1-adjuvanted IIV at all doses of HA compared with SD IIV. Adjuvanted vaccine induced higher antibody responses against a limited number of non-study vaccine influenza B and A/H3N2 viruses including ones from subsequent years. Conclusion: MAS-1 adjuvant in a 0.3 mL dose volume provided HA dose-sparing effects without safety concerns and induced higher HAI antibody and seroconversion responses through at least 6 months, demonstrating potential to provide greater vaccine efficacy throughout an influenza season in younger adults. In summary, MAS-1 may provide enhanced, more durable and broader protective immunity compared with non-adjuvanted SD IIV. Clinical Trial Registry: ClinicalTrials.gov # NCT02500680.",

The sigma-1 receptor is an important target for drug development in several neuropsychiatric diseases, including Alzheimer's disease (AD). Accumulating evidence has shown that the integrity and functional activity of the blood\u2013brain barrier (BBB) in AD are impaired, which is closely related to the movement of amyloid beta (A\u03b2) across the BBB and the formation of A\u03b2 plaques. In this study, we investigated the effects of sigma-1 receptor activation on BBB disruption and A\u03b2 levels in AD mice. We found that PRE-084, a sigma-1 receptor agonist, attenuated learning and memory deficits in A\u03b2\u2013injected mice, significantly increased levels of low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 1 (LRP-1), and lowered the A\u03b2 level synergistically in the brain. Moreover, the upregulation of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) levels through the sigma-1 receptor may be involved in the reduction of the BBB permeability by PRE-084. The identification of this previously unexplored role of the sigma-1 receptor in alleviating BBB disruption via upregulating the levels of VEGF and LRP-1 in AD suggests that reversing BBB dysfunction through sigma-1 receptor activation may be a promising treatment for AD.",

Introduction: The severity of SARS-CoV-2 induced coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) depends on the presence of risk factors and the hosts' gene variability. There are preliminary results that gene polymorphisms of the renin-angiotensin system can influence the susceptibility to and mortality from COVID-19. Angiotensin II type 1 receptor (AT1R) might be a gene candidate that exerts such influence. The aim of this study was to elaborate on the association between A1166C at1r polymorphic variants and the susceptibility to and severity of COVID-19 in the Ukrainian population. Methods: The study population consisted of the Ukrainian population (Poltava region) with COVID-19, divided into three clinical groups in accordance with oxygen requirement: patients without oxygen therapy (n = 110), with non-invasive (n = 136) and invasive (n = 36) oxygen therapy. The A1166C polymorphism of the at1r was determined by polymerase chain reaction with subsequent restrictase analysis. In an attempt to better explain the role of the A1166C at1r polymorphism we compared its association with COVID-19, essential hypertension (n = 79), renoparenchimal hypertension (n = 30) and dyscirculatory encephalopathy (n = 112). The data for this comparison were obtained by meta-analysis. Results: We observed significant differences in the frequency of AA, AC and CC genotypes in the groups of COVID-19 patients with non-invasive and invasive oxygen therapy in comparison with control subjects as well as in the frequency of combined AC + CC genotype between the groups of COVID-19 patients with any types of oxygen therapy and patients without oxygen therapy. The frequency of the 1166C allele was higher in COVID-19 patients with invasive oxygen therapy (OR = 2.06; CI (1.20\u20133.53); p = 0.013). We obtained important results indicating that there were no differences between the frequency of at1r polymorphisms in patients with cardiovascular disease and severe COVID-19 with invasive oxygen therapy as well as those who died due to COVID-19. Conclusion: Our study indicated the presence of an association between the A1166C at1r polymorphisms and the severity of COVID-19 in the Ukrainian population. It seems that in carriers of 1166C at1r, the severity of COVID-19 and oxygen dependency is higher as compared to the A allele carriers, possibly, due to cardiovascular disorders.",

Cancer is the second leading cause of death in the world. Some of the usual cancer treatments include surgery, chemotherapy, and radiotherapy. However, due to low efficacy and side effects of these treatments, novel targeted therapeutic methods are needed. One of the common drawbacks of cancer chemotherapy is off-target toxicity. In order to overcome this problem, many investigations have been conducted. One of the new targeted therapy methods known as bacterial directed enzyme-prodrug therapy (BDEPT) employs bacteria as enzyme carriers to convert a pro-drug to a drug specifically within the tumor site. In the present study, we used Escherichia coli DH5\u03b1 carrying luxCDABE gene cluster and overexpressing \u03b2-glucuronidase for luminescent emission and enzyme expression, respectively. Enzyme expression can lead to the conversion of glycyrrhizic acid as a prodrug to glycyrrhetinic acid, a potent anti-cancer agent. DH5\u03b1-lux/\u03b2G was characterized and its stability was also evaluated. Bacteria colonization in the tumor site was measured by tissue homogenate preparation and colony counting method. Histopathological studies on the liver, spleen, and tumor were also conducted. According to the results, co-treatment of 4T1, a highly metastatic mouse breast cancer cell line, with GL and DH5\u03b1-lux/\u03b2G could significantly decrease the IC50 values. Moreover, increased number of bacteria could lead to a dramatic drop in IC50 value. Specific colonization of DH5\u03b1-lux/\u03b2G was observed in the tumor site compared with other tissues (p < 0.0001). Moreover, the biocompatibility evaluation proved that DH5\u03b1-lux/\u03b2G had no adverse effects on normal tissues. Furthermore, concurrent usage of GL and bacteria in the treatment of induced 4T1 tumors in BALB/c mice significantly delayed tumor growth (p<0.001) during 16 days of investigation. Based on these findings, BDEPT might be useful for targeted breast cancer therapy, although further investigations are required to confirm this.",

Background: QRS duration and morphology including left bundle branch block (LBBB) are the most widely used electrocardiogram (ECG) markers for assessing ventricular dyssynchrony and predicting heart failure (HF). However, the vectorcardiographic QRS area may more accurately identify delayed left ventricular activation and HF development. Objective: We investigated the association between QRS area and incident HF risk in patients with LBBB. Methods: By crosslinking data from Danish nationwide registries, we identified patients with a first-time digital LBBB ECG between 2001 and 2015. The vectorcardiographic QRS area was derived from a 12\u2011lead ECG using the Kors transformation method and grouped into quartiles. The endpoint was a composite of HF diagnosis, filled prescriptions for loop diuretics, or death from HF. Cause-specific multivariable Cox regression was used to compute hazard ratios(HR) with 95% confidence intervals(CI). Results: We included 3316 patients with LBBB free from prior HF-related events (median age, 72 years; male, 40%). QRS area quartiles comprised Q1, 36\u201398 \u03bcVs; Q2, 99\u2013119 \u03bcVs; Q3, 120\u2013145 \u03bcVs; and Q4, 146\u2013295 \u03bcVs.

Purpose: COVID-19 immunizations are novel and there is widespread public concern for the lack of data on their potential adverse effects. Cases of Bell's palsy following COVID-19 vaccination were reported disproportionately in the vaccine group during phase 3 clinical trials and have now been reported multiple times post-licensure. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has stated the frequency of Bell's palsy in the vaccine group is consistent with the expected background rate of Bell's palsy in the population but recommends \u201csurveillance for cases of Bell's palsy with deployment of the vaccine into larger populations.\u201c1 Here we present a case of Bell's palsy following Pfizer/BioNTech BNT162b2 COVID-19 vaccine administration in an HIV+ patient as a potential adverse event following immunization. Observations: A 60-year-old male with HIV presented to the emergency department for evaluation of left facial droop. He had received the first dose of Pfizer/BioNTech BNT162b2 vaccination approximately 42 hours prior to symptom onset. Physical examination in the ED revealed left-sided facial weakness with involvement of the forehead, inability to raise left eyebrow, and inability to close left eye with sensation and strength intact in bilateral upper and lower extremities. Physical examination in our outpatient ophthalmology clinic on day 2 following symptom onset was revealing for mild exposure keratopathy, 5 mm lagophthalmos and very poor Bell's reflex in the left eye with otherwise normal exam findings. These findings were judged to be consistent with uncomplicated Bell's palsy. He was provided ophthalmic lubricating ointment to use hourly, artificial tears as needed, moisture goggles and suggested to tape eyelids nightly in addition to standard systemic glucocorticoid and antiviral therapy. The patient's facial weakness and exposure keratopathy were completely resolved at approximately 90 days following symptom onset. Conclusions: Though there is insufficient evidence at this time to support any causal association between COVID-19 vaccines and Bell's palsy, the temporal relationship between vaccination and classic clinical features of Bell's palsy in our patient certainly raises suspicion for association with Pfizer/BioNTech BNT162b2 COVID-19 vaccination.

Backgrounds: Berberine (BBR), a compound long used in traditional Chinese medicine, has been reported to have therapeutic effects in treating ulcerative colitis (UC), attributed to its anti-inflammatory properties and restorative potential of tight junctions (TJs). However, the mechanism by which BBR affects intestinal bacteria and immunity is still unclear. Methods: This study investigated the effects of BBR on intestinal bacteria and the inflammatory response in dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced colitis mice. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) and electron microscopy were used to detect intestinal TJs. Microflora analysis was used to screen for bacteria regulated by BBR. Results: The results showed that BBR had increased colonic epithelium zonula occludens proteins-1 (ZO-1) and occludin expression and reduced T-helper 17/T regulatory ratio in DSS-induced mice. Mechanically, BBR eliminated DSS-induced intestinal flora disturbances in mice, particularly increased Bacteroides fragilis (B. fragilis) in vivo and in vitro. B. fragilis decreased the interleukin-6 induced by dendritic cells through some heat-resistant component rather than nucleic acids or proteins. Conclusions: Overall, these data suggest that BBR had a moderating effect on DSS-induced colitis.

            "context": "Borneol enhances the protective effect against cerebral ischemia/reperfusion injury by promoting the access of astragaloside IV and the components of Panax notoginseng saponins into the brain. Background: Astragalus and Panax notoginseng are significant traditional Chinese medicines for treating ischemic stroke, with astragaloside IV (AST IV) and Panax notoginseng saponins (PNS) being the major effective compounds, respectively. These compounds can also be used in combination. We have previously shown that AST IV and PNS have an antagonistic effect on cerebral ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury, and the combination of these two drugs can elevate this effect; unfortunately, AST IV and PNS cannot easily enter the brain tissues through the blood brain barrier (BBB). Previous studies have confirmed that the combination of borneol with other agents could promote the penetration of the drug components through the BBB. However, it remains unclear whether borneol can promote entry of the active components of AST IV and PNS into the brain tissues and enhance their effect against cerebral ischemia. Objective: This study aimed to investigate the effects of a combination of borneol with AST IV and PNS against I/R injury and explore the mechanisms of borneol-promoting penetration of drug components into the BBB based on the drug transport of brain tissues. Methods: A rat model of focal cerebral I/R injury was established, and drugs, including borneol, AST IV, and PNS, as well as their combinations were intragastrically administered. Subsequently, drug efficacy was assessed, and the condition of AST IV and PNS active components (Rg1, Rb1, R1) delivered into the brain was analyzed. Moreover, BBB permeability was determined, and the expression of related drug transporters and their genes were evaluated. Results: After treatment with borneol, AST IV, PNS, AST \u2163+PNS, and borneol+AST \u2163+PNS after cerebral I/R, the neurological function deficit scores, cerebral infarct rate, and brain water content markedly decreased. The effects of the three-drug-combination were better than those of the drugs used alone and those of AST \u2163+PNS. Moreover, after I/R in rats, AST IV and the components of PNS (Rg1, Rb1, R1) were mainly found in the cerebral cortex and in the cerebellum, respectively, when used alone. Borneol combined with AST IV and PNS increased the contents of AST IV, Rb1, Rg1, and R1 in the cerebral cortex and in the cerebellum, thus, promoting the enrichment of active components to the cerebral cortex, especially to the affected side. In addition, following I/R, diffuse distribution of lanthanum particles in the basement membrane, intercellular and intracellular locations of rat brain tissues indicated BBB destruction and increase in permeability, which were alleviated in each drug group. The effects of borneol combined with AST IV and PNS were stronger than those of the drug single-used and those of the AST IV+PNS group. Finally, the expression of effluent transporters (ET) and their genes, including P-glycoprotein (P-gp), multidrug resistance protein (MRP)-1, MRP-2, MRP-4, and MRP-5 in brain tissues, strikingly increased after I/R. Borneol remarkedly down-regulated the protein expression of P-gp, MRP-2, and MRP-4 in the brain, whereas PNS down-regulated MRP-4 and MRP-5 protein expression. AST IV, AST IV+PNS, and bornoel+AST IV+PNS effectively decreased the expression of P-gp, MRP-2, MRP-4, and MRP-5 proteins. The effects of the three-drug combination were significantly greater than those of the drug single-used and AST IV+PNS groups. The expression of each ET gene manifested corresponding results. Meanwhile, PNS, AST IV+PNS, and bornoel+AST IV+PNS significantly inhibited the down-regulation of the uptake transporter organic anion transporting polypeptide (OATP)-2 expression, and the effect of bornoel+AST IV+PNS was stronger than that of other groups. Conclusion: After I/R, the brain tissues were injured, BBB permeability increased, expression of critical ET and their genes were markedly up-regulated, and the main uptake transporters were down-regulated. We propose that the combination of borneol, AST IV and PNS could enhance the effect against cerebral I/R injury and protect BBB integrity. The potential mechanism might be the delivery of AST IV and active components of PNS to the brain tissues after treatment in combination with borneol, which could be effectively promoted by down-regulating the expression of ETs and up-regulating the expression of uptake transporters in the brain tissues. This study was the first to demonstrate that borneol combined with AST IV+PNS enhanced the effect against cerebral I/R injury through promoting the entry of AST and PNS active components to the brain tissues. Thus, this study proposes an instructive role in developing effective active ingredients combination of Chinese medicine with clear ingredients and synergistic effects in terms of the characteristic of borneol.",

Purpose: To report a case of bilateral Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada (VKH)-like granulomatous pan uveitis secondary to brentuximab vedotin (BV) administration to treat for classical Hodgkin lymphoma (CHL). Observations: A case of bilateral pan uveitis is described, following administration of BV, with features of VKH-like uveitis: presence of inflammatory cells in the anterior and posterior segment, multiple small serous detachments around the optic disc and retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) folds confirmed by optical coherence tomography (OCT) as well as hypocyanesent dark dots, disc hyperfluorescence and fuzzy vascular patterns seen on indocyanine green and fluorescein angiography. There were no systemic features of VKH disease. Further etiological investigation showed no clear infectious or inflammatory cause. The uveitis responded well to treatment with corticosteroids and cessation of BV. A relapse occurred a few months later when BV treatment was reinitiated, suggesting a probable adverse event to this drug, according to the Naranjo algorithm. Conclusions: We hypothesize that administration of BV can induce a VKH-like uveitis, caused by loss of function of protective CD30+ cells present in the uveal tract, possibly aggravated by collateral damage to surrounding CD30\u2212cells and melanocytes, leading to a uveal immune reaction. It is therefore important for the clinicians using BV to be aware of this adverse event. Growing experience with immunotherapy will provide more clinical insights in these complex immune mechanisms in the future.",

Deubiquitinases (DUBs) mediate the removal of ubiquitin from diverse proteins that participate in the regulation of cell survival, DNA damage repair, apoptosis and drug resistance. Previous studies have shown an association between activation of cell survival pathways and platinum-drug resistance in ovarian carcinoma cell lines. Among the strategies available to inhibit DUBs, curcumin derivatives appear promising, thus we hypothesized their use to enhance the efficacy of cisplatin in ovarian carcinoma preclinical models. The caffeic acid phenethyl ester (CAPE), inhibited ubiquitin-specific protease 8 (USP8), but not proteasomal DUBs in cell-free assays. When CAPE was combined with cisplatin in nine cell lines representative of various histotypes a synergistic effect was observed in TOV112D cells and in the cisplatin-resistant IGROV-1/Pt1 variant, both of endometrioid type and carrying mutant TP53. In the latter cells, persistent G1 accumulation upon combined treatment associated with p27kip1 protein levels was observed. The synergy was not dependent on apoptosis induction, and appeared to occur in cells with higher USP8 levels. In vivo antitumor activity studies supported the advantage of the combination of CAPE and cisplatin in the subcutaneous model of cisplatin-resistant IGROV-1/Pt1 ovarian carcinoma as well as CAPE activity on intraperitoneal disease. This study reveals the therapeutic potential of CAPE in cisplatin-resistant ovarian tumors as well as in tumors expressing USP8.",

Objective: To compare key seizure and outcome characteristics between neonates with and without cardiopulmonary disease. Study design: The Neonatal Seizure Registry is a multicenter, prospectively acquired cohort of neonates with clinical or electroencephalographic (EEG)-confirmed seizures. Cardiopulmonary disease was defined as congenital heart disease, congenital diaphragmatic hernia, and exposure to extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. We assessed continuous EEG monitoring strategy, seizure characteristics, seizure management, and outcomes for neonates with and without cardiopulmonary disease. Results: We evaluated 83 neonates with cardiopulmonary disease and 271 neonates without cardiopulmonary disease. Neonates with cardiopulmonary disease were more likely to have EEG-only seizures (40% vs 21%, P <.001) and experience their first seizure later than those without cardiopulmonary disease (174 vs 21 hours of age, P <.001), but they had similar seizure exposure (many-recurrent electrographic seizures 39% vs 43%, P =.27). Phenobarbital was the primary initial antiseizure medication for both groups (90%), and both groups had similarly high rates of incomplete response to initial antiseizure medication administration (66% vs 68%, P =.75). Neonates with cardiopulmonary disease were discharged from the hospital later (hazard ratio 0.34, 95% CI 0.25-0.45, P <.001), although rates of in-hospital mortality were similar between the groups (hazard ratio 1.13, 95% CI 0.66-1.94, P =.64). Conclusion: Neonates with and without cardiopulmonary disease had a similarly high seizure exposure, but neonates with cardiopulmonary disease were more likely to experience EEG-only seizures and had seizure onset later in the clinical course.

Background: The British Isles Lupus Assessment Group-based Composite Lupus Assessment (BICLA) is a validated global measure of treatment response in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) clinical trials but does not include patient-reported outcomes. To evaluate the clinical meaningfulness of a BICLA response from the patient perspective, we aimed to analyse patient-reported outcomes by BICLA responses with anifrolumab or placebo in patients with moderate to severe SLE. Methods: We did a post-hoc analysis of pooled data from the phase 3 TULIP-1 (NCT02446912) and TULIP-2 (NCT02446899) trials of anifrolumab, which assessed health-related quality of life using the Short Form 36 Health Survey (SF-36; version 2) and Lupus Quality of Life, fatigue using the Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy-Fatigue (FACIT-F), pain using the Numerical Rating Scale, and disease activity using Patient Global Assessment. Changes from baseline and proportions of patients reporting improvements in patient-reported outcomes greater than or equal to the minimum clinically important differences and scores greater than or equal to the normative values were compared in BICLA responders and non-responders and by treatment group (intravenous anifrolumab 300 mg or placebo). Findings: 726 patients were included in the TULIP trials, of whom 366 received placebo (184 patients in TULIP-1 and 182 in TULIP-2) and 360 received anifrolumab 300 mg (180 patients in each trial). The mean patient age was 41\u00b78 years (SD 11\u00b79). 674 (93%) patients were female, 52 (7%) were male, and 479 (66%) were White; 283 (39%) were BICLA responders and 443 (61%) were BICLA non-responders. Compared with non-responders, BICLA responders reported greater mean improvements from baseline at week 52 in Patient Global Assessment, SF-36, Lupus Quality of Life, FACIT-F, and pain Numerical Rating Scale scores (all nominal p<0\u00b70053). Compared with non-responders, a greater proportion of BICLA responders reported improvements greater than or equal to the minimum clinically important difference across all SF-36 domains; eg, Physical Component Summary (165 [60%] of 277 for responders vs 63 [15%] of 416 for non-responders), Mental Component Summary (140 [51%] of 276 vs 59 [15%] of 416), and role physical (184 [70%] of 264 vs 76 [19%] of 398); Lupus Quality of Life domains; eg, physical health (151 [58%] of 262 vs 60 [15%] of 396), and intimate relationships (77 [41%] of 187 vs 33 [11%] of 286), and FACIT-F (155 [56%] of 276 vs 66 [15%] of 439). Similarly, a greater proportion of BICLA responders had scores equal to or greater than the normative values across all SF-36 domains and FACIT-F compared with BICLA non-responders at week 52.

Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic autoimmune joint disorder that affects about 1% of the world population and may lead to severe disability and comorbidity. Despite breakthroughs in past decades to understand its pathogenesis and the development of transforming disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs, the symptoms of many patients are not substantially improved. Sinomenine (SIN), a natural alkaloid with poor solubility, has been used to treat RA in China for years because of its unique immunoregulative activity. However, its commercial hydrochloride form has a short half-time, which may cause huge fluctuations of blood drug concentration leading to severe adverse reactions. In this study, co-amorphous systems of SIN with three nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), including indomethacin, naproxen, and sulindac, were prepared for the combination therapy, as well as the improvement of its aqueous solubility and controlled release. Each co-amorphous sample was characterized by powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD), temperature-modulated differential scanning calorimetry (mDSC), and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). The CO2\u2013 and N+[sbnd]H stretching vibration in the three co-amorphous samples appears in FTIR spectra, suggesting the formation of salts between SIN and NSAIDs.

Psoriasis is an immune-mediated skin disorder that affects populations worldwide.

However, low solubility and side effects through oral administration hinder its systemic application. In this study, we developed a novel niosomes based on ceramide (cerosomes) to co-deliver MTX and nicotinamide (NIC), i.e., MTX/NIC cerosomes, for topically treating psoriasis with the aim to enhancing the efficacy and reducing the toxicity. NIC significantly solublized MTX by forming hydrogen bonds with MTX. In vitro and in vivo permeation studies showed that the cerosomes significantly promoted drug permeation through and retention in the skin, and the enhancing mechanism was clarified by Fourier transform infrared and Raman spectroscopy. MTX/NIC cerosomes exhibited strong anti-proliferation effect on lipopolysaccharide- irritated HaCaT cells by arresting the cell cycle at S phase and inducing apoptosis. Importantly, compared to MTX oral administration, topical application of MTX/NIC cerosomes on imiquimod (IMQ)-induced psoriatic mouse model exhibited a superior performance in ameliorating skin lesions, reducing spleen index and epidermal thickness, and downregulating the mRNA expression levels of proinflammatory cytokines including TNF\u03b1, IL-23, IL-17A, IL-6, IL-1\u03b2, and IL-22.

Objectives: Second-line immune checkpoint inhibition (ICI) was recently shown to have a survival advantage over placebo in malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM), but the survival comparison to chemotherapy in patients with MPM receiving routine clinical care is unknown. Our objective was to examine the effectiveness of second-line ICI versus chemotherapy on overall survival (OS) outcomes in real-world patients with advanced MPM. Materials and Methods: We performed a multicenter retrospective cohort study of real-world adult patients with advanced MPM who received first-line platinum-based chemotherapy and at least two total lines of systemic therapy. Patients received either second-line chemotherapy (gemcitabine and/or vinorelbine) or ICI therapy (pembrolizumab or nivolumab \u00b1 ipilimumab). The primary outcome was OS, defined as the time from second-line therapy initiation to death or end of the observation period. We used Kaplan-Meier methods and Cox proportional hazards modeling with adjustment for relevant patient demographic and clinical variables to compare OS between the two second-line treatment groups. Results: Of the 176 patients with MPM, the median age was 75 years (IQR: 69\u201379.5 years), and most were white (77%), male (74%), and had epithelioid histology (67%). Thirty-five percent (61) received second-line chemotherapy and 65% (1 1 5) ICI therapy (80 pembrolizumab, 31 nivolumab, and 4 nivolumab + ipilimumab). Treatment with ICI was associated with significantly longer median OS compared to chemotherapy (8.7 vs 5.0 months, p=0.001; adjusted hazard ratio: 0.52, 95% CI: 0.34\u20130.81). The estimated 12-month OS probability was 36.7% (95% CI: 27.6%-45.8%) and 15.6% (95% CI: 7.7%-26.1%) in the ICI and chemotherapy groups, respectively. Conclusion: In this \u201creal-world\u201d population of patients with MPM, treatment with ICI was associated with improved OS outcomes compared to chemotherapy in the second-line setting, in contrast with a recent clinical trial.

Purpose: The SARAH (Sorafenib Versus Radioembolization in Advanced Hepatocellular Carcinoma) trial (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier NCT01482442) did not show a significant survival benefit for patients treated with transarterial radioembolization (TARE) compared with continuous oral sorafenib. The improved toxicity profile of patients treated with TARE in the trial, however, could result in a quality of life benefit in economic evaluations. Our objective was to perform a cost-utility analysis of TARE versus sorafenib for locally advanced and inoperable hepatocellular carcinoma. Methods: This study used patient-level data of the SARAH trial regarding resource use, progression-free and overall survival, and quality of life for the within-trial period for the patients who received at least 1 dose of sorafenib or 1 treatment with TARE according to their randomization arm. Data were extrapolated by using a partitioned survival model that incorporated costs and health outcomes, measured in life-years and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs). Findings: The use of TARE resulted in an average loss of 0.036 life-year and a gain of 0.006 QALY compared with sorafenib. The aerage cost for the TARE arm was \u20ac17,179 (95% CI, 9,926\u201324,280) higher than the sorafenib arm, for an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of \u20ac3,153,086/QALY. The probabilistic sensitivity analysis revealed a 50% risk that the TARE strategy was dominated. TARE was consistently dominated by sorafenib or had an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio more than \u20ac450,000/QALY in all sensitivity analyses. Implications: This economic evaluation of SARAH found that using radioembolization with yttrium-90 microspheres for the treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma was not a cost-effective option at the usually accepted willingness-to-pay thresholds.",

The difference-in-differences investigation approach shows that with the vaccine's arrival, the Google search trends measuring fear and anxiety are increasing. The arrival of the vaccine has created a general feeling of fear, and people have a lack of confidence in the vaccine's efficiency to overcome the Covid-19 crisis. Specifically, anxiety increased when the delta variant was discovered in India. Governments' interventions must ensure that the Covid-19 vaccine does not have adverse side effects that can harm public health. We suggested that policy makers should focus on increasing the number of older adults willing to receive the vaccine.

Introduction: Pilonidal sinus is a chronic inflammatory disease seen in the intergluteal sulcus. A wide variety of treatment modalities have been described for the management of this disease, however optimal therapy remains controversial. The study aims to compare phenol treatment, a minimally invasive method used in the treatment of pilonidal sinus disease, with the commonly practiced surgical methods of excision and primary closure in the adolescent age group. Patients and Methods: Adolescent patients who presented with pilonidal sinus disease between January 2018 and December 2018 were randomized into 2 groups as phenol treatment and surgical treatment (after obtaining consent for the study). Early complications and recurrence rates after 24 months of follow-up were the two main endpoints of the study. Results: A total of 100 patients (phenol group n = 50, surgery group n = 50) were included in the study. Both groups were similar in terms of age, gender, and BMI. The mean duration of the procedure was 12.4 \u00b1 2.84 min in the phenol group and 42.3 \u00b1 7.22 min in the surgery group (p = 0.00). There was no difference in postoperative complications between the groups (p = 0.22). After 24 months of follow-up, recurrence was found in 8% (n = 4) of the cases in the phenol group and 10% (n = 5) of the cases in the surgery group (p = 0.5). Conclusion: In our study, phenol treatment and excision/primary closure methods for pilonidal sinus disease have similar complication and recurrence rates. However, phenol treatment seems to be the method of choice in the adolescent age group as it has the advantage of being a minimally invasive method and it does not affect subsequent surgical treatments.

Introduction: Abnormal extravillous trophoblast (EVT) function is closely related to preeclampsia (PE) and may be caused by inadequate autophagy, apoptosis, and senescence. Cyclosporin A (CsA) is an effective immunosuppressant that has been reported to stimulate autophagy and exert benign biological effects on EVTs. Therefore, we hypothesized that CsA may display therapeutic efficacy against PE by activating autophagy. Methods: We established the nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME)-induced preeclamptic mice model and a hypoxia\u2010reoxygenation (H/R) model in vitro. The effects of CsA on autophagy were evaluated by western blotting (WB). The effects of CsA on apoptosis were analyzed by Hematoxylin-eosin (H&E) staining, cell apoptosis assay and WB. Senescence\u2010associated \u03b2\u2010galactosidase (SA\u2010\u03b2\u2010gal) staining, RT-qPCR and WB were used to examine the senescence level. RT-qPCR were used to detect the senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP) level. DCFH-DA fluorescent probe, dihydroethidium (DHE) staining and mitochondrial membrane potential (\u0394\u03a8m) were used to detect senescence-associated mitochondrial dysfunction (SAMD). Results: CsA alleviated PE-like symptoms and reduced placental necrosis and senescence in mice injected with L-NAME. CsA ameliorated placental SASP and SAMD level induced by L-NAME. CsA also upregulated the expression of autophagic proteins in mouse placentas disrupted using L-NAME. In vitro, we found that CsA reversed H/R-induced apoptosis and senescence, as well as decreasing SASP and SAMD levels and upregulating autophagic proteins levels. Notably, 3-methyladenine (3-MA), an early phase inhibitor of autophagosome formation, abolished the protective effects of CsA against H/R. Discussion: CsA may display some therapeutic effects against PE by activating autophagy in vivo and in vitro.",

Dabrafenib is a BRAF inhibitor used in combination treatment of malignant melanoma and non-small cell lung carcinoma. In this study, we aimed to characterize its interactions with cytochrome P450 (CYP) isoenzymes and ATP-binding cassette (ABC) efflux transporters that have critical impact on the pharmacokinetics of drugs and play a role in drug resistance development. Using accumulation assays, we showed that dabrafenib inhibited ABCG2 and, less potently, ABCB1 transporter. We also confirmed dabrafenib as a CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP3A4, and CYP3A5 inhibitor. Importantly, inhibition of ABCG2 and CYP3A4 by dabrafenib led to the potentiation of cytotoxic effects of mitoxantrone and docetaxel toward respective resistant cell lines in drug combination studies. On the contrary, the synergistic effect was not consistently observed in ABCB1-expressing models. We further demonstrated that mRNA levels of ABCB1, ABCG2, ABCC1, and CYP3A4 were increased after 24 h and 48 h exposure to dabrafenib. Overall, our data confirm dabrafenib as a drug frequently and potently interacting with ABC transporters and CYP isoenzymes.

Purpose: Radioiodine therapy, a standard treatment for differentiated thyroid carcinomas, is associated with several adverse events including lacrimal drainage system obstruction. Herein, we describe the first case of duct lumen recanalization using dacryoendoscopy for lacrimal passage obstruction and stenosis after radioiodine therapy. Observations: A 48-year-old female treated with radioiodine therapy for differentiated thyroid carcinoma 5 years prior presented with epiphora in both eyes. Dacryocystography showed nasolacrimal duct stenosis in the right eye and nasolacrimal duct obstruction in the left eye. Dacryoendoscopic examination revealed right common canalicular polyps, fibrosis in the right lacrimal sac, right nasolacrimal duct stenosis, and left upper and common canaliculus stenosis. Lacrimal passage recanalization with the insertion of a nasolacrimal stent tube using dacryoendoscopy was performed on the right eye. This successfully resolved the epiphora. Conclusions and importance: Dacryoendoscopic examination for epiphora after radioiodine therapy may help detect early-stage nasolacrimal passage obstruction/stenosis. This condition can be resolved by recanalization and insertion of a lacrimal tube, without the need for a more invasive surgical approach such as dacryocystorhinostomy.",

The objective of the present research was to prepare fast dissolving orodispersible films (ODFs) for simultaneous administration of BCS class II drug (meloxicam (MX)) and tizanidine (TZ) using solvent casting method to improve the bioavailability of both drugs. ODFs were prepared by synthetic (polyvinyl alcohol), semisynthetic (hydroxypropyl methyl cellulose, HPMC; hydroxyethyl cellulose, HEC) and natural (xanthan gum) polymers. The prepared formulations were investigated for physico-chemical parameters, mechanical strength, surface morphology and in vitro and in vivo drug release studies. The prepared ODFs were also evaluated through stability studies and histopathology. The results indicated that disintegration time, tensile strength, folding endurance and pH of film surface of all formulations are in the range from 20 to 60 s, 10.87\u201321.75, >100 times and 4.09\u20134.87, respectively. In vitro drug release study indicated a fast and maximum release of MX and TZ from all formulations within 5 min. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and visual observation of all formulations have shown a smooth surface with homogenous distribution of all ingredients. Stability study of formulations for six months did not show any significant imperfection except a decrease in disintegration and dissolution time of all formulations due to water absorbing capacity of the polymers.

Estrogen receptor-positive (ER+) breast carcinomas are the most common subtype, corresponding to 60% of the cases in premenopausal and 75% in postmenopausal women. The third-generation of aromatase inhibitors (AIs), the non-steroidal Anastrozole (Ana) and Letrozole (Let) and the steroidal Exemestane (Exe), are considered a first-line endocrine therapy for postmenopausal women. Despite their clinical success, the development of resistance is the major setback in clinical practice. Nevertheless, the lack of cross-resistance between AIs hints that these drugs may act through distinct mechanisms. Therefore, this work studied the different effects induced by AIs on biological processes, such as cell proliferation, death, autophagy and senescence. Moreover, their effects on the regulation of the hormonal environment were also explored. The non-steroidal AIs induce senescence, through increased YPEL3 expression, on aromatase-overexpressing breast cancer cells (MCF-7aro), whereas Exe promotes a cytoprotective autophagy, thus blocking senescence induction. In addition, in a hormone-enriched environment, the non-steroidal AIs prevent estrogen signaling, despite up-regulating the estrogen receptor alpha (ER\u03b1), while Exe down-regulates ER\u03b1 and maintains its activation. In these conditions, all AIs up-regulate the androgen receptor (AR) which blocks EGR3 transcription in Exe-treated cells. On the other hand, in hormone-depleted conditions, a crosstalk between AR and ER\u03b1 occurs, enhancing the estrogenic effects of Exe. This indicates that Exe modulates both ER\u03b1 and AR, while Ana and Let act as pure AIs. Thus, this study highlights the potential clinical benefit of combining AR antagonists with Exe and discourages the sequential use of Exe as second-line therapy in postmenopausal breast cancer.",

Morphine-induced analgesic tolerance and dependence are significant limits of pain control; however, the exact molecular mechanisms underlying morphine tolerance and dependence have remained unclear. The role of long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) in morphine tolerance and dependence is yet to be determined. We aimed to explore the association of specific lncRNAs expression in key brain reward regions after repeated injection of morphine. Male Wistar rats received subcutaneous injections of twice-daily morphine (10 mg/kg) or saline (1 mL/kg) for eight days. On day 8 of the repeated injections, induction of morphine analgesic tolerance and dependence was confirmed through a hotplate test and a naloxone-precipitated withdrawal analysis, respectively. Expression of H19, BC1, MIAT1, and MALAT1 lncRNAs was determined from the midbrain, striatum, hypothalamus, prefrontal cortex (PFC), and hippocampus by real-time PCR on day 8 of the repeated injections. The H19 expression was significantly different between morphine-treated and control saline-treated rats in all investigated areas except for the hippocampus. The BC1 expression significantly altered in the midbrain, hypothalamus, and hippocampus, but not in the striatum and PFC after repeated morphine treatment. The MIAT1 and MALAT1 expression site-specifically altered in the midbrain, hypothalamus, and striatum; however, no significant changes were detected in their expression in the PFC and hippocampus after repeated morphine treatment.

Multiple sclerosis (MS) is especially known as a demyelinating disease of the central nervous system. Current treatments for MS are mostly based on controlling neuroinflammation and there are no treatments to promote the remyelination process at present. Diosgenin is a known herbal anti-inflammatory and antioxidant agent, which has also been shown to stimulate the growth of myelin in vitro. However, there is no or little evidence about diosgenin effects; specially on myelination, neuroprotection and its corresponding mechanisms in vivo in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) as the most valid experimental model of MS. In this study, the therapeutic effect of diosgenin on clinical signs of EAE, and the corresponding cellular and molecular mechanisms have been examined with emphasis on myelination and neuroprotection mechanisms. EAE was induced using myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG) antigen in C57BL/6 mice. Diosgenin was gavaged (100 mg/kg) daily with the onset of paralysis signs (half tail paralysis) until the 18th post-immunization day in the treatment group. Blood and spinal cord tissue sampling was performed on post-immunization day 18. Lumbar spinal cord inflammation, demyelination, and axonal degeneration were assessed using Hematoxylin and Eosin (H & E), Luxol Fast Blue (LFB), and Bielschowsky's silver staining methods, respectively. Serum and spinal cord tissue level of tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF\u03b1) and tissue levels of matrix metalloproteinase 9 (MMP-9) and interleukin 17 (IL-17) as inflammatory markers, microtubule-associated proteins 1A/1B light chain 3A (MAP1LC3A), and activity dependent neuroprotector homeobox (ADNP) as neuroprotective markers were assayed using enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) method. The clinical score of EAE in the diosgenin treatment group was significantly reduced compared to the EAE group on days 15 to 18 after induction of the EAE (p < 0.001). Inflammation, demyelination and axonal loss scores also decreased significantly in the diosgenin treatment group compared to the EAE group (p < 0.05). Serum and spinal cord tissue level of TNF\u03b1 and tissue level of MMP-9 considerably decreased in the diosgenin treatment group in comparison with the EAE group (p < 0.01). Diosgenin treatment had no significant effects on the tissue levels of IL-17, ADNP and MAP1LC3A. Therefore, diosgenin improved the clinical signs of EAE through lowering neuroinflammation, demyelination and axonal degeneration, but did not significantly affect the neuroprotective factors in this study.

We report the results of the French Temporary Authorization of Use (ATU) compassionate program of letermovir for primary prophylaxis conducted in 21 transplant centers. Patients were CMV seropositive allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation recipients and at high risk for CMV infection. Primary prophylaxis was defined as initiation of letermovir between day 0 and day +28 post-transplant. Between November 2017 and January 2019, 96 patients with a median age of 56 years received letermovir and follow-up data were available for 78 patients. The median time from transplant to letermovir initiation was 4 days, and the median duration of exposure to letermovir was 78 days, with 57 patients still on treatment at the cutoff date. Letermovir was temporarily discontinued in 4 patients (5.1%) and stopped in 39 patients (50.0%), in most cases due to planned end of treatment (n = 16, 20.5%). Fifteen patients (19.2%) each presented one positive CMV PCR, in median 13 days after letermovir initiation. Clinically significant CMV infection was reported in 5 patients (6.4%). No CMV disease was reported. At least one adverse drug reaction was reported for 12 patients (15.4%). In this early access program, letermovir was effective with comparable results of the phase 3 study with a low rate of clinically significant CMV infection, including in patients who were at high-risk for CMV infection.",

Background: Vaccine effectiveness studies have not differentiated the effect of the delta (B.1.617.2) variant and potential waning immunity in observed reductions in effectiveness against SARS-CoV-2 infections. We aimed to evaluate overall and variant-specific effectiveness of BNT162b2 (tozinameran, Pfizer\u2013BioNTech) against SARS-CoV-2 infections and COVID-19-related hospital admissions by time since vaccination among members of a large US health-care system. Methods: In this retrospective cohort study, we analysed electronic health records of individuals (\u226512 years) who were members of the health-care organisation Kaiser Permanente Southern California (CA, USA), to assess BNT162b2 vaccine effectiveness against SARS-CoV-2 infections and COVID-19-related hospital admissions for up to 6 months. Participants were required to have 1 year or more previous membership of the organisation. Outcomes comprised SARS-CoV-2 PCR-positive tests and COVID-19-related hospital admissions. Effectiveness calculations were based on hazard ratios from adjusted Cox models. This study was registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04848584. Findings: Between Dec 14, 2020, and Aug 8, 2021, of 4 920 549 individuals assessed for eligibility, we included 3 436 957 (median age 45 years [IQR 29\u201361]; 1 799 395 [52\u00b74%] female and 1 637 394 [47\u00b76%] male). For fully vaccinated individuals, effectiveness against SARS-CoV-2 infections was 73% (95% CI 72\u201374) and against COVID-19-related hospital admissions was 90% (89\u201392). Effectiveness against infections declined from 88% (95% CI 86\u201389) during the first month after full vaccination to 47% (43\u201351) after 5 months. Among sequenced infections, vaccine effectiveness against infections of the delta variant was high during the first month after full vaccination (93% [95% CI 85\u201397]) but declined to 53% [39\u201365] after 4 months. Effectiveness against other (non-delta) variants the first month after full vaccination was also high at 97% (95% CI 95\u201399), but waned to 67% (45\u201380) at 4\u20135 months. Vaccine effectiveness against hospital admissions for infections with the delta variant for all ages was high overall (93% [95% CI 84\u201396]) up to 6 months. Interpretation: Our results provide support for high effectiveness of BNT162b2 against hospital admissions up until around 6 months after being fully vaccinated, even in the face of widespread dissemination of the delta variant. Reduction in vaccine effectiveness against SARS-CoV-2 infections over time is probably primarily due to waning immunity with time rather than the delta variant escaping vaccine protection.

Advances in genetic research on microbiome have led to several trials on the effectiveness of synbiotics or probiotics in patients with depression; however, none have evaluated the efficacy of prebiotics. 4G-beta-D-Galactosylsucrose (Lactosucrose, LS) is selectively assimilated by Bifidobacterium as a prebiotic and improves microbiome diversity. However, as it is not clear if LS consumption can improve symptoms of depression, we investigated whether LS intake can improve depressive symptoms, quality of life (QOL), and self-efficacy by conducting a single cite, double-blinded, randomized controlled trial in 20 outpatients with depressive episodes (F32, ICD-10) for 24 weeks. Participants (age range, 36\u201372 years) were randomized to the LS (n = 9) or placebo groups (n = 11). Primary outcome was improvement in total Montgomery Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) score, and the secondary outcomes were MADRS subscores, global self-efficacy scale (GSES) score, World Health Organization QOL (WHO/QOL-26) score, and 16S rRNA analysis of the fecal microbiome. LS consumption did not significantly improve total MADRS scores (\u22122 (\u221216 to 16) vs 0 (\u22126 to 10), p = 0.552), but GSES tended to improve in the LS group (2.00 \u00b1 4.24 vs \u22121.36 \u00b1 4.15, p = 0.091) with a large effect size (Cohen's d = 0.802). Sequencing of 16S rRNA revealed individual-level differences in microbiome diversity changes due to the intervention. Thus, we show that LS intake can improve self-efficacy, but not depressive symptoms, even in a small sample. Additional studies that also regulate diet and ensure adherence may help determine a correlation between depression and the gut microbiome.",

Fragile X Syndrome (FXS) is caused by silencing the FMR1 gene which results in intellectual disability, hyperactivity, sensory hypersensitivity, autistic-like behavior, and susceptibility to seizures. This X-linked disorder is also associated with reduced cAMP levels in humans as well as animal models. We assessed the therapeutic and neurochemical effects of chronic administration of the phosphodiesterase-4D negative allosteric modulator, BPN14770, in a mouse model of FXS (Fmr1 KO). Groups of male Fmr1 KO mice and control littermates were treated with dietary BPN14770 commencing postnatal day 21. A dose-response effect was investigated. At 90 days of age, mice underwent behavior tests including open field, novel object recognition, three chambered sociability and social novelty tests, passive avoidance, and sleep duration analysis. These tests were followed by in vivo measurement of regional rates of cerebral protein synthesis (rCPS) with the autoradiographic L-[1-14C]leucine method. BPN14770 treatment had positive effects on the behavioral phenotype in Fmr1 KO mice. Some effects such as increased sleep duration and increased social behavior occurred in both genotypes. In the open field, the hyperactivity response in Fmr1 KO mice was ameliorated by BPN14770 treatment at low and intermediate doses. BPN14770 treatment tended to increase rCPS in a dose-dependent manner in WT mice, whereas in Fmr1 KO mice effects on rCPS were less apparent. Results indicate BPN14770 treatment improves some behavior in Fmr1 KO mice. Results also suggest a genotype difference in the regulation of translation via a cAMP-dependent pathway.",

As an adenosine receptor A2A antagonist, istradefylline is used as an adjunctive agent of levodopa to improve motor symptoms in advanced Parkinson's disease (PD) patients. In this study, we re-evaluated the effects of istradefylline on treating the motor symptoms of PD patients. We performed a literature search up to November 2021 from electronic databases. Eligible studies were synthesized for efficacy, tolerability, OFF time, Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale part III score, ON state with dyskinesia, and the incidence of treatment-emergent adverse events. As a result, nine clinical studies with 2727 subjects on istradefylline treatment for PD patients were included. Our results showed that compared to placebo, istradefylline exhibited a statically significant difference in efficacy (1.39 [1.15 to 1.69]; p = 0.001), decreasing OFF time (\u22120.58 [\u22121.01 to \u2212 0.16]; p = 0.007), and improving ON state with dyskinesia (0.69 [0.02 to 1.37]; p = 0.043). For tolerability, UPDRS III, and adverse effects, there was no significant difference between istradefylline and placebo. In conclusion, the results suggest that istradefylline exhibits an efficient and well-tolerated role in treating PD patients.

Objective: This study simulated the 5-year risk of diabetes complications associated with the use of iGlarLixi, a fixed-ratio combination of insulin glargine 100 U/ml and lixisenatide, in type 2 diabetes (T2D) using the BRAVO diabetes model. Methods: The six-month efficacy data of iGlarLixi and Standard of Care (SOC) were extracted from the LixiLan-O (NCT02058147) and ORIGIN (NCT00069784) trials, respectively. The trial participants' baseline characteristics were standardized to the ACCORD trial through a matching method. The BRAVO diabetes simulation model was used to project the 5-year complications based on T2D people baseline characteristics and treatment efficacy. An optimistic scenario where the six-month relative efficacy of iGlarLixi (i.e., iGlarlixi-SOC) lasted for 5 years, and a conservative scenario where the relative effect of iGlarLixi waned to none within 5 years were simulated. Results: iGlarLixi compared with SOC was found to reduce HbA1c (\u22121.4%), SBP (\u22123.4 mm Hg), and BMI (\u22120.6 kg/m2) in six months. We simulated a 5-year risk reduction in major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) (relative risk [RR] 0.77, 95% CI: 0.67\u20130.88), and all-cause mortality (RR 0.94, 95% CI: 0.92\u20130.96) under an optimistic scenario, and MACE (RR 0.86, 95% CI: 0.75\u20130.96), and all-cause mortality (RR 0.96, 95% CI: 0.92\u20130.98) under a conservative scenario. Conclusions: The long-term use of iGlarLixi may lead to a substantial reduction in diabetes-related complications among people with T2D at elevated risk for CVD. The use of a simulation model to evaluate outcomes of treatment in a well-characterized patient cohort is novel. Such an approach may serve as a template for future evaluation of medications and combinations when the effect of a treatment is known, but a long-term outcome trial is not feasible.",

Mutation of Klotho gene causes hyperphosphatemia and acute heart failure. However, the relationship of hyperphosphatemia and acute heart failure is unclear. We hypothesize that hyperphosphatemia mediates Klotho deficiency-induced acute heart failure and further that therapeutic reduction of hyperphosphatemia prevents acute heart failure in Klotho mutant (KL(\u2212/\u2212)) mice. Methods and results: A significant elevation of serum phosphorus levels and a large reduction of heart function were found in KL(\u2212/\u2212) mice by six weeks of age. Normalization of serum phosphorus levels by low phosphate diet (LPD) rescued Klotho deficiency-induced heart failure and extended lifespan in male mice. Klotho deficiency impaired cardiac mitochondrial respiratory enzyme function and increased superoxide production, oxidative stress, and cardiac cell apoptosis in male KL(\u2212/\u2212) mice which can be eliminated by LPD. LPD, however, did not rescue hyperphosphatemia or heart failure in female KL(\u2212/\u2212) mice. LPD did not affect estrogen depletion in female KL(\u2212/\u2212) mice. Normalization of serum estrogen levels by treatment with 17\u03b2-estradiol prevented hyperphosphatemia and heart failure in female KL(\u2212/\u2212) mice. Mechanistically, treatment with 17\u03b2-estradiol rescued hyperphosphatemia via inhibiting renal Na-Pi co-transporter expression. Normalization of serum phosphorus levels by treatment with 17\u03b2-estradiol also abolished cardiac mitochondrial respiratory enzyme dysfunction, ROS overproduction, oxidative stress and cardiac cell apoptosis in female KL(\u2212/\u2212) mice. Conclusion: Klotho deficiency causes acute heart failure via hyperphosphatemia in male mice which can be prevented by LPD. 17\u03b2-estradiol prevents Klotho deficiency-induced hyperphosphatemia and heart failure by eliminating upregulation of renal Na-Pi co-transporter expression in female mice.",

Objectives: the efficacy of delayed intravenous tissue plasminogen activator (tPA), beyond the 4.5 h window, is evolving. Advanced age and high admission National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score are proposed to adversely affect the outcome of delayed thrombolysis and limit the inclusion criteria. The summation of patient age and admission NIHSS score was introduced as the SPAN-100 index as a tool of prediction of the clinical outcome after acute ischemic stroke (AIS). We aimed to assess the SPAN-100 index in AIS thrombolysed patients after 4.5 h. Materials and Methods: The SPAN-100 index was applied to AIS patients receiving delayed IV thrombolysis (IVT) after 4.5 h. Patients demographics, risk factors, clinical, laboratory and radiological data, mismatch evidence, treatment onset and modality, NIHSS score at baseline and at discharge, and 3 months follow-up modified Rankin Scale (mRS) were reviewed. SPAN-100 score \u2265 100 is classified as SPAN-100 positive while score < 100 is SPAN-100 negative. Clinical outcomes, death and intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) incidences were compared between SPAN-100 positive and negative groups. Results: SPAN-100-positive delayed IVT-patients (11/136) had a 6-fold increased risk for unfavorable outcome compared to SPAN-negative patients (OR 6.34; 95% CI 1.59\u201325.24 p=0.004), however there was no relation between the SPAN-100 positivity and mortality or ICH. Conclusion: SPAN-100-positive patients are more likely to achieve non-favorable outcome with delayed IVT in comparison to the SPAN-100-negative patients.

Background: Although the number of measles cases declined globally in response to anti-measles immunisation campaigns, measles has re-emerged. A review of current vaccination policies is required to improve measles elimination strategies. Methods: A pseudotype-based virus neutralisation assay (PVNA) was used to measure neutralising antibody titres in serum samples collected from Thai infants at six timepoints before and after two-doses of MMR (1&2) vaccination (ClinicalTrials.gov no. NCT02408926). Vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) luciferase pseudotypes bearing the haemaglutinin (H) and fusion (F) glycoproteins of measles virus (MeV) were prepared. Serial dilutions of serum samples were incubated with VSV (MeV) pseudotypes and plated onto HEK293-human SLAM1 cells; the neutralising antibody titre was defined as the dilution resulting in 90% reduction in luciferase activity. Results: Neutralising antibody titres in infants born with high levels of maternal immunity (H group) persisted at the time of the first MMR vaccination, and those infants did not respond effectively by developing protective titres. In contrast, infants with lower maternal immunity (L group) developed protective titres of antibody following vaccination. Responses to the second MMR vaccination were significantly higher (P = 0.0171, Wilcoxon signed-rank test) in the H group. The observed correlation between anti-MeV IgG level and neutralising antibody titre in Thai infants indicates the possibility of using rapid IgG testing as a surrogate measure for neutralising activity to define clinical protection levels within populations. Conclusion: These results demonstrate that varying the timing of the first MMR immunisation according to the level of acquired maternal immunity could increase vaccination immunogenicity and hence accelerate measles eradication.",

Cisplatin (CDDP) is widely used for chemotherapy of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) but the drug resistance limits its therapeutic benefit. Heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein U-like 1 (HNRNPUL1) belongs to the family of RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) and is involved in DNA damage repair. To investigate whether and how HNRNPUL1 affects CDDP resistance of ESCC, we evaluated the expression of HNRNPUL1 and found that it was associated with recurrence in ESCC patients receiving postoperative platinum-based chemotherapy and was an independent prognostic factor for disease-free survival (DFS). Besides, we showed that the reduced expression of HNRNPUL1 enhanced the CDDP sensitivity of ESCC cells. Furthermore, RNA immunoprecipitation coupled with high-throughput sequencing (RIP-seq) were performed and a range of HNRNPUL1-binding RNAs influenced by CDDP treatment were identified followed by bioinformatics analysis. In terms of mechanism, we found that HNRNPUL1 inhibited CDDP sensitivity of ESCC cells by regulating the CDDP sensitivity-inhibited circular RNA (circRNA) MAN1A2 formation.

Purpose: To present a case of severe retinal toxicity secondary to high dose intracameral cefuroxime administered during trabeculectomy glaucoma surgery. We describe the clinical features and management, and describe serial multimodal imaging and electrophysiological findings. Intracameral cefuroxime (ICC) and subconjunctival cefuroxime (SCC) are routinely administered during ocular surgeries to prevent postoperative endophthalmitis. Cefuroxime toxicity with both standard (1mg/0.1mL) and high doses of ICC (2\u2013100mg) and SCC (31.25mg) have been reported. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of cefuroxime retinal toxicity in trabeculectomy surgery, which is of particular significance because of the possible differences in pharmacokinetics within the eye. Observations: A 69-year-old male with primary open-angle glaucoma, underwent right trabeculectomy, augmented with mitomycin C (0.2mg/mL). The patient inadvertently received cefuroxime 12.5mg/0.1mL as an intracameral rather than a subconjunctival injection. Within 4 hours, the error was discovered and the patient underwent immediate anterior chamber (AC) washout. His right best-corrected visual acuity was hand movements, and he rapidly developed uveitis including AC cells and moderate vitritis and haze. Optical coherence tomography (OCT) demonstrated serous macular detachment, characteristic schisis-like changes in the outer nuclear layer and ellipsoid zone disruption. Multi-focal electroretinograms (ERG) identified deficits undetected by full-field ERG. He was successfully managed with intensive local topical corticosteroid, non-steroidal therapy and peri-ocular corticosteroid injection. Conclusions and importance: As ICC and SCC are routinely used in intra-ocular surgery to prevent endophthalmitis, ophthalmologists need to be aware of this potential complication and consider this in patients with unexplained reduced vision post-operatively. Theatre teams need to be vigilant about potential dilution and administration errors to ensure that the correct concentration and volume of cefuroxime is given via the correct route. We highlight the risks of high dose intracameral injection, including uveitis and retinal toxicity, and the utility of serial OCT, and full-field and multi-focal ERGs in this condition. We report a favourable outcome with significant and rapid improvement in retinal structure and function observed during follow-up. A literature review of the condition is presented.",

In this observational study, adult health care workers (n = 126) who received two consecutive anti-SARS-CoV-2 vaccinations by BNT162b2 were followed for up to 24 weeks, with blood samples collected at the first and second dose and at three and 21 weeks after the second dose. Serum SARS-CoV-2 IgG titres, neutralising antibody potency, total Se and selenoprotein P concentrations, and glutathione peroxidase 3 activity were quantified. All three biomarkers of Se status were significantly correlated at all the time points, and participants who reported supplemental Se intake displayed higher Se concentrations. SARS-CoV-2 IgG titres and neutralising potency were highest three weeks after the second dose and decreased towards the last sampling point. The humoral immune response was not related to any of the three Se status biomarkers. Supplemental Se intake had no effect at any time point on the vaccination response as measured by serum SARS-CoV-2 IgG levels or neutralising potency. Overall, no association was found between Se status or supplemental Se intake and humoral immune response to COVID-19 mRNA vaccination.",

Zika virus (ZIKV) infection could lead to Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome in adults and microcephaly in the newborns from infected pregnant women. To date, there is no specific drug for the treatment of ZIKV infection. In this study, we sought to screen inhibitors against ZIKV infection from a natural product library. A ZIKV replicon was used to screen a library containing 1680 natural compounds. We explored the antiviral mechanism of the compound candidate in vitro and in vivo infection models. Ascomycin, a macrolide from Streptomyces hygroscopicus, was identified with inhibitory effect against ZIKV in Vero cells (IC50 = 0.11 \u03bcM), hepatoma cell Huh7 (IC50 = 0.38 \u03bcM), and glioblastoma cell SNB-19 (IC50 = 0.06 \u03bcM), far below the cytotoxic concentrations. Mechanistic study revealed that Ascomycin suppressed ZIKV RNA replication step during the life cycle and the regulation of calcineurin-NFAT pathway maybe involved in this inhibitory effect, independent of innate immunity activation. Moreover, we found that Ascomycin also inhibited the infection of other Flaviviridae members, such as hepatitis C virus and dengue virus. Ascomycin reduced ZIKV load in blood by up to 3500-fold in A129 mice. Meanwhile, the infection in the mice brain was undetectable by immunohistochemistry staining. Together, these findings reveal a critical role of Ascomycin in the inhibition of ZIKV and related viruses, facilitating the development of novel antiviral agents.",

SARS-CoV-2 has rapidly emerged as a global pandemic with high infection rate. At present, there is no drug available for this deadly disease. Recently, Mpro (Main Protease) enzyme has been identified as essential proteins for the survival of this virus. In the present work, Lipinski's rules and molecular docking have been performed to identify plausible inhibitors of Mpro using food compounds. For virtual screening, a database of food compounds was downloaded and then filtered using Lipinski's rule of five. Then, molecular docking was accomplished to identify hits using Mpro protein as the target enzyme. This led to identification of a Spermidine derivative as a hit. In the next step, Spermidine derivatives were collected from PubMed and screened for their binding with Mpro protein. In addition, molecular dynamic simulations (200 ns) were executed to get additional information. Some of the compounds are found to have strong affinity for Mpro, therefore these hits could be used to develop a therapeutic agent for SARS-CoV-2.",

Aim: To evaluate the impact of quetiapine treatment on central set point of thyroid homeostasis in patients with acute phase schizophrenia. Methods: During Jan. 2016 to Dec. 2018, we conducted a retrospective cohort study in \u201cthe Second Affiliated Hospital of Xinxiang Medical University\u201d. All patients admitted for treatment of schizophrenia being euthyroid at admission and reevaluated for thyroid function during hospitalization were recruited and followed until discharge. Patients treated with mood stabilizers during hospitalization were excluded. Quetiapine use was the exposure measure. The primary outcomes were the parameters of central set point of thyroid homeostasis measured by \u201cthyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) index\u201d and \u201cthyroid feedback quantile-based index (TFQI)\u201d. Multiple regression models were used to estimate the association between quetiapine exposure and outcomes. Results: A total of 1302 patients were enrolled in this study. Quetiapine exposure was associated with a more significant decline in the TSH index and TFQI, and the adjusted \u03b2 and 95% confidence interval (CI) were \u22120.12 (\u22120.22, \u22120.01) and \u22120.10 (\u22120.15, \u22120.05), respectively.

Oxidative distress and mitochondrial dysfunction, are key factors involved in the pathophysiology of Parkinson's disease (PD). The pleiotropic hormone insulin-like growth factor II (IGF-II) has shown neuroprotective and antioxidant effects in some neurodegenerative diseases. In this work, we demonstrate the protective effect of IGF-II against the damage induced by 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium (MPP+) in neuronal dopaminergic cell cultures and a mouse model of progressive PD. In the neuronal model, IGF-II counteracts the oxidative distress produced by MPP + protecting dopaminergic neurons. Improved mitochondrial function, increased nuclear factor (erythroid-derived 2)-like2 (NRF2) nuclear translocation along with NRF2-dependent upregulation of antioxidative enzymes, and modulation of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signalling pathway were identified as mechanisms leading to neuroprotection and the survival of dopaminergic cells. The neuroprotective effect of IGF-II against MPP + -neurotoxicity on dopaminergic neurons depends on the specific IGF-II receptor (IGF-IIr). In the mouse model, IGF-II prevents behavioural dysfunction and dopaminergic nigrostriatal pathway degeneration and mitigates neuroinflammation induced by MPP+. Our work demonstrates that hampering oxidative stress and normalising mitochondrial function through the interaction of IGF-II with its specific IGF-IIr are neuroprotective in both neuronal and mouse models. Thus, the modulation of the IGF-II/IGF-IIr signalling pathway may be a useful therapeutic approach for the prevention and treatment of PD.",

Background: In sub-Saharan Africa, the efficacy of intermittent preventive therapy in pregnancy with sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine (IPTp-SP) for malaria in pregnancy is threatened by parasite resistance. We conducted an individual-participant data (IPD) meta-analysis to assess the efficacy of intermittent screening with malaria rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) and treatment of RDT-positive women with artemisinin-based combination therapy (ISTp-ACT) compared to IPTp-SP, and understand the importance of subpatent infections. Methods: We searched MEDLINE and the Malaria-in-Pregnancy Library on May 6, 2021 for trials comparing ISTp-ACT and IPTp-SP. Generalised linear regression was used to compare adverse pregnancy outcomes (composite of small-for-gestational-age, low birthweight (LBW), or preterm delivery) and peripheral or placental Plasmodium falciparum at delivery. The effects of subpatent (PCR-positive, RDT/microscopy-negative) infections were assessed in both arms pooled using multi-variable fixed-effect models adjusting for the number of patent infections. PROSPERO registration: CRD42016043789. Findings: Five trials conducted between 2007 and 2014 contributed (10,821 pregnancies), two from high SP-resistance areas where dhfr/dhps quintuple mutant parasites are saturated, but sextuple mutants are still rare (Kenya and Malawi), and three from low-resistance areas (West-Africa). Four trials contributed IPD data (N=10,362). At delivery, the prevalence of any malaria infection (relative risk [RR]=1.08, 95% CI 1.00-1.16, I2=67.0 %) and patent infection (RR=1.02, 0.61-1.16, I2=0.0%) were similar. Subpatent infections were more common in ISTp recipients (RR=1.31, 1.05-1.62, I2=0.0%). There was no difference in adverse pregnancy outcome (RR=1.00, 0.96-1.05; studies=4, N=9,191, I2=54.5%). Subpatent infections were associated with LBW (adjusted RR=1.13, 1.07-1.19), lower mean birthweight (adjusted mean difference=32g, 15-49), and preterm delivery (aRR=1.35, 1.15-1.57). Interpretation: ISTp-ACT was not superior to IPTp-SP and may result in more subpatent infections than the existing IPTp-SP policy.

Orexins or hypocretins are excitatory neuropeptides predominantly produced by neuronal clusters in the lateral hypothalamus. The orexinergic system's involvement in pain modulation makes it a candidate for pain control alternative to the opioid system. Moreover, orexin-1 and orexin -2 receptors (OX1r and OX2r, respectively) play a role in responsiveness to stressful stimuli. Some evidence indicates that the Cornu Ammonis 1 (CA1) region of the hippocampus potentially participates in the modulation of both pain and stress. In quest of better understanding the interaction between orexin receptors and stress-induced analgesia (SIA), The present study examined the involvement of OX1r and OX2r within the CA1 in response to acute pain after exposure to forced swim stress (FSS) for a 6-min period. Adult male Wistar rats received different doses of OX1r antagonist (SB334867; 1, 3, 10, and 30 nmol), OX2r antagonist (TCS OX2 29; 3, 10, 30 and 100 nmol), or vehicle (0.5 \u03bcl DMSO) through an implanted cannula. After that, animals individually experienced acute pain by performing the tail-flick test. Results indicated that FSS produces antinociceptive responses in the tail-flick test. Blockade of both orexin receptors within the CA1 region attenuated the analgesic effect of FSS. The antinociceptive effect of swim stress was prevented by lower doses of SB334867 than TCS OX2 29.

Background: Irisin, a novel myokine, has been identified to exert a series of favorable effects on metabolic diseases, including diabetes and obesity. This study aimed to explore the effects of chronic irisin administration on blood pressure and the related underlying mechanisms in Zucker diabetic fatty (ZDF) rats. Methods and results: Male ZDF rats and Zucker lean (ZL) rats received a continuous subcutaneous infusion of irisin or saline for 4 weeks. Compared with ZL counterparts, ZDF rats reported higher systolic blood pressure (SBP), severer renal inflammation, increased oxidative stress, and impaired natriuresis and diuresis; they also had an elevated AT1R expression in renal cortex and augmented candesartan-induced natriuresis and diuresis. The irisin administration lowered SBP, improved diuretic and natriuretic effects, and reduced renal inflammation and oxidative stress in ZDF rats, along with decreased renal expression of AT1R and restored candesartan-mediated natriuresis and diuresis. Further experiments showed that irisin inhibited the translocation of NF-\u03baB from the cytosol to the nucleus and the activation of NF-\u03baB signaling pathway, which may contribute to the reduced AT1R expression and function. Conclusions: Irisin administration serves an anti-hypertensive role in ZDF rats by alleviating renal inflammation and oxidative stress, reducing the expression and impact of AT1R, and restoring natriuresis and diuresis.

Purpose: To report a case of late onset corneal decompensation following cataract surgery due to retained lens fragment in anterior chamber. Observations: A 65 year old female presented with complaint of gradual dimness of vision in left eye since 4 months. She underwent uneventful phacoemulsification with posterior chamber intraocular lens implantation elsewhere 4 years back. On examination, the CDVA in left eye was 20/200. Slit-lamp examination revealed corneal edema with Descemet's folds. She was diagnosed as pseudophakic bullous keratopathy and was being treated with topical steroids, cycloplegics and hyperosmolar agents for the same. She was also counseled about a lamellar corneal transplant. Posterior segment examination was within normal limits. Since the position of the IOL (sulcus versus bag) was not clearly seen ultrasound biomicroscopy (UBM) and anterior segment optical coherence tomography (AS-OCT) imaging was performed to try and better understand the possible cause for corneal decompensation. To our surprise, on both, UBM and ASOCT, a single, retained lens fragment was noted at 6 0'clock in the anterior chamber. AC wash was performed to remove the retained lens fragment. 3 months post AC wash corneal edema resolved completely with improvement in the BCVA to 20/40. Conclusion: AND IMPORTANCE: This case highlights the importance of a thorough clinical evaluation supplemented with imaging modalities in order to make a complete diagnosis and eventually achieve better outcomes for the patient.

MITOL/MARCH5 is an E3 ubiquitin ligase that plays a crucial role in the control of mitochondrial quality and function. However, the significance of MITOL in cardiomyocytes under physiological and pathological conditions remains unclear. First, to determine the significance of MITOL in unstressed hearts, we assessed the cellular changes with the reduction of MITOL expression by siRNA in neonatal rat primary ventricular cardiomyocytes (NRVMs). MITOL knockdown in NRVMs induced cell death via ferroptosis, a newly defined non-apoptotic programmed cell death, even under no stress conditions. This phenomenon was observed only in NRVMs, not in other cell types. MITOL knockdown markedly reduced mitochondria-localized GPX4, a key enzyme associated with ferroptosis, promoting accumulation of lipid peroxides in mitochondria. In contrast, the activation of GPX4 in MITOL knockdown cells suppressed lipid peroxidation and cell death. MITOL knockdown reduced the glutathione/oxidized glutathione (GSH/GSSG) ratio that regulated GPX4 expression. Indeed, the administration of GSH or N-acetylcysteine improved the expression of GPX4 and viability in MITOL-knockdown NRVMs. MITOL-knockdown increased the expression of the glutathione-degrading enzyme, ChaC glutathione-specific \u03b3-glutamylcyclotransferase 1 (Chac1). The knockdown of Chac1 restored the GSH/GSSG ratio, GPX4 expression, and viability in MITOL-knockdown NRVMs. Further, in cultured cardiomyocytes stressed with DOX, both MITOL and GPX4 were reduced, whereas forced-expression of MITOL suppressed DOX-induced ferroptosis by maintaining GPX4 content. Additionally, MITOL knockdown worsened vulnerability to DOX, which was almost completely rescued by treatment with ferrostatin-1, a ferroptosis inhibitor. In vivo, cardiac-specific depletion of MITOL did not produce obvious abnormality, but enhanced susceptibility to DOX toxicity. Finally, administration of ferrostatin-1 suppressed exacerbation of DOX-induced myocardial damage in MITOL-knockout hearts. The present study demonstrates that MITOL determines the cell fate of cardiomyocytes via the ferroptosis process and plays a key role in regulating vulnerability to DOX treatment. (288/300)",

In Italy, the inclusion of measles vaccine in children immunization schedule and the promotion of national mass vaccination campaigns increased measles vaccination coverage. However, measles outbreaks continue to occur increasingly involving adolescents and adults. The aim of this study was to evaluate the prevalence to measles antibody in a sample of Italian population between 1993 and 2018. Human serum samples from subjects aged 3\u201340 years were collected between 1993 and 2018 and tested for measles IgG antibodies by commercial ELISA. During the study period, the 3\u201310-year-old age group showed the most important change, with a significant increase in 2003\u20132007 in both seroprevalence and IgG levels, followed by a slow decrease. The 11\u201318-year-old age group showed relatively stable seroprevalence rates and IgG levels over the years. The 19\u201330-year-old group showed stable seroprevalence rates, albeit with a decrease in IgG levels. After a significant increase in 1999\u20132002, the 31\u201340-year-old age group had high seroprevalence rates and IgG levels. Despite efforts at national level for implementing measles vaccination, a large proportion of the population is still susceptible to measles. Even if vaccination coverage increases enough to achieve the level of immunization required for herd immunity in new birth cohorts, outbreaks will continue to occur if there are immunity gaps in older age groups. Establishing policies for measles vaccination targeting adult population is needed to close immunity gaps and reach the elimination goal.",

Chronic social isolation stress (SIS) could impair learning and memory-related behaviors. Herein, we investigated the efficacy of Melatonin in treatment of memory despair and also its possible underlying mechanism of action in an animal model of SIS. For this purpose, mice were allocated to two opposing conditions, including social condition (SC) and isolated condition (IC), for five weeks. The study consisted of three groups, including saline-treated SC, saline-treated IC, Melatonin-treated IC (10 mg/kg/day for five successive days). At the end of the isolation period, mice underwent three neurobehavioral tests: passive avoidance (PA), Morris water maze (MWM), and Y maze (YM) tests. Hippocampus samples were obtained and the expressions of BDNF, TrkB, phosphorylated TrkB (pTrkB), CREB, phosphorylated CREB (pCREB), as well as M1 and M2 microglia were assessed. Interpreting the behavioral tests, we found that isolated mice showed lower freezing response in the PA test, lower number of novel arm visits in the YM, and higher escape latency and less time spent in the target quadrant in the MWM, when compared to SC rodents (P values < 0.001). The isolated group had higher M1/M2 relative ratio (P < 0.001), as well as lower concentrations of BDNF mRNA (p < 0.001) and protein (P < 0.001), TrkB protein (P = 0.035), CREB mRNA (P < 0.001) and protein (P = 0.012), pTrkB (P < 0.001), and pCREB (P = 0.035).

The aim of the current research was to study the effect of chronic administration of metanil yellow on the cerebellar cortex of rats and to evaluate the protective effect of scutellarin. Forty adult male rats were allocated into four groups: group I acted as control, group II was administrated scutellarin (100 mg/kg/day), group III was administrated metanil yellow (200 mg/kg/day), and group IV was administrated scutellarin and metanil yellow as in group II and group III.

Metanil yellow induced a significant rise in the malondialdehyde coupled with a significant reduction in the superoxide dismutase and glutathione peroxidase. The Purkinje cells were irregular and shrunken with condensed nuclei. A significant elevation in glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) and cleaved caspase-3 as well as a significant reduction of synaptophysin expression were revealed in comparison with the control group.

Triple-negative metaplastic breast carcinoma (MBC) poses a significant treatment challenge due to lack of targeted therapies and chemotherapy resistance. We isolated a novel MBC cell line, BAS, which showed a molecular and phenotypic profile different from the only other metaplastic cell model, HS578T cells. To gain insight behind chemotherapeutic resistance, we generated doxorubicin (HS-DOX, BAS-DOX) and paclitaxel (HS-TX, BAS-TX) resistant derivatives of both cell lines. Drug sensitivity assays indicated a truly multidrug resistant (MDR) phenotype. Both BAS-DOX and BAS-TX showed up-regulation of FOXC1 and its experimental down-regulation re-sensitized cells to doxorubicin and paclitaxel. Experimental modulation of FOXC1 expression in MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells corroborated its role in MDR. Genome-wide expression analyses identified gene expression signatures characterized by up-regulation of TGFB2, which encodes cytokine TGF-\u03b22, in both BAS-DOX and BAS-TX cells. Pharmacological inhibition of the TGF-\u03b2 pathway with galunisertib led to down-regulation of FOXC1 and increase in drug sensitivity in both BAS-DOX and BAS-TX cells. MicroRNA (miR) expression analyses identified high endogenous miR-495-3p levels in BAS cells that were downregulated in both BAS MDR cells. Transient expression of miR-495-3p mimic in BAS-DOX and BAS-TX cells caused downregulation of TGFB2 and FOXC1 and re-sensitized cells to doxorubicin and paclitaxel, whereas miR-495-3p inhibition in BAS cells led to increase in resistance to both drugs and up-regulation of TGFB2 and FOXC1.

Introduction: The aim of the study was to explore the mechanism by which minocycline protects the blood\u2013brain barrier (BBB) in septic rats. Methods: A sepsis rat model was generated in healthy, male Sprague\u2013Dawley rats by cecal ligation and puncture (CLP). The rats were randomly divided into four groups and treated as follows: sham-operated plus normal saline (Sham + S group), CLP plus normal saline (CLP + S group), CLP plus minocycline pretreatment (CLP + M1 group), and CLP plus minocycline treatment (CLP + M2 group). Rats in the CLP + M1 group received 45 mg/kg minocycline by intraperitoneal injection every 12 h for 72 h. Rats in the Sham + S and CLP + S groups were injected with the same volume of normal saline every 12 h for 72 h. Rats in the CLP + M2 group were intraperitoneally injected with 45 mg/kg minocycline immediately after CLP and once every 12 h for 72 h. All rats were sacrificed at 72 h after operation. Tumor necrosis factor \u03b1 and interleukin 6 levels, the expression of ionized calcium-binding adaptor molecule-1 (Iba-1), and the permeability of the BBB were measured. The expression of matrix metalloproteinases-9 (MMP-9) and the tight junction proteins zonula occludens-1 (ZO-1) and occludin was detected by Western blot. In addition, Evans blue (EB) staining, immunohistochemistry, and ELISA analysis were carried out. Results: Minocycline pretreatment significantly inhibited microglial activation, decreased the sepsis-induced expression of MMP-9, increased the expression of ZO-1 and occludin, and improved the permeability of the BBB. Minocycline treatment failed to inhibit microglial activation, decrease the sepsis-induced expression of MMP-9, increase the expression of ZO-1 or occluding, or improve the permeability of the BBB. Conclusions: Minocycline pretreatment can effectively improve the altered permeability of the BBB caused by sepsis. The mechanism may be related to the inhibition of microglial activation and MMP-9 expression and increased expression of ZO-1 and occludin.",

Background: Dysregulated inflammation is associated with poor outcomes in COVID-19. We aimed to assess the efficacy of namilumab (a granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor inhibitor) and infliximab (a tumour necrosis factor inhibitor) in hospitalised patients with COVID-19, to prioritise agents for phase 3 trials. Methods: In this randomised, multicentre, multi-arm, multistage, parallel-group, open-label, adaptive, phase 2, proof-of-concept trial (CATALYST), we recruited patients (aged \u226516 years) admitted to hospital with COVID-19 pneumonia and C-reactive protein (CRP) concentrations of 40 mg/L or greater, at nine hospitals in the UK. Participants were randomly assigned with equal probability to usual care or usual care plus a single intravenous dose of namilumab (150 mg) or infliximab (5 mg/kg). Randomisation was stratified by care location within the hospital (ward vs intensive care unit [ICU]). Patients and investigators were not masked to treatment allocation. The primary endpoint was improvement in inflammation, measured by CRP concentration over time, analysed using Bayesian multilevel models. This trial is now complete and is registered with ISRCTN, 40580903. Findings: Between June 15, 2020, and Feb 18, 2021, we screened 299 patients and 146 were enrolled and randomly assigned to usual care (n=54), namilumab (n=57), or infliximab (n=35). For the primary outcome, 45 patients in the usual care group were compared with 52 in the namilumab group, and 29 in the usual care group were compared with 28 in the infliximab group. The probabilities that the interventions were superior to usual care alone in reducing CRP concentration over time were 97% for namilumab and 15% for infliximab; the point estimates for treatment\u2013time interactions were \u20130\u00b709 (95% CI \u20130\u00b719 to 0\u00b700) for namilumab and 0\u00b706 (\u20130\u00b705 to 0\u00b717) for infliximab. 134 adverse events occurred in 30 (55%) of 55 patients in the namilumab group compared with 145 in 29 (54%) of 54 in the usual care group. 102 adverse events occurred in 20 (69%) of 29 patients in the infliximab group compared with 112 in 17 (50%) of 34 in the usual care group. Death occurred in six (11%) patients in the namilumab group compared with ten (19%) in the usual care group, and in four (14%) in the infliximab group compared with five (15%) in the usual care group. Interpretation: Namilumab, but not infliximab, showed proof-of-concept evidence for reduction in inflammation\u2014as measured by CRP concentration\u2014in hospitalised patients with COVID-19 pneumonia.

Purpose: In the Guidelines for the Prevention and Control of Type 2 Diabetes in China (2017 edition), intensive lifestyle interventions are recommended for preventing the progression of impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) to type 2 diabetes mellitus. Acarbose and metformin can also be considered if intensive lifestyle modification has been ineffective for 6 months. But the effects of intensive lifestyle modification and glucose-lowering drug interventions that work best in the population with IGT are unclear. This network meta-analysis assessed the effectiveness of intensive lifestyle modification, acarbose, and metformin in treating populations with IGT. Methods: We systematically searched both Chinese- and English-language databases, including China Knowledge, the Cochrane Library, Embase, PubMed, VIP, and Wanfang, for articles published between database inception and September 2019. Randomized, controlled clinical trials in patients with IGT treated with acarbose, metformin, and intensive lifestyle modification were assessed for eligibility. The data from all included studies were evaluated by 2 reviewers independently in accordance with the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Intervention version 6.0. A network meta-analysis was performed by using R software version 3.6.1. Findings: The data from 53 randomized controlled trials were included in the review, with a sample size of 21,208 patients. Compared with the control group, the use of acarbose, metformin, and/or intensive lifestyle modification was associated with reduced rates of progression to diabetes (relative risks [RRs] [95% credible intervals]: acarbose, 0.37 [0.29\u20130.47]; metformin, 0.39 [0.30\u20130.50]; intensive lifestyle modification, 0.61 [0.50\u20130.73]). The surface under the cumulative ranking (SUCRA) value of acarbose was 88.35%, supporting that acarbose was more effective in reducing the rate of progression to diabetes compared with controls. With acarbose, metformin, and intensive lifestyle modification, the rates of achieving a normal glucose level were increased by RR = 2.1, 1.7, and 1.2, respectively when compared with control group. The SUCRA value of acarbose was 99.69%, supporting the optimal effect of acarbose in achieving a normal blood glucose level. Implications: In this meta-analysis in patients with IGT, compared with controls, acarbose and metformin were associated with decreased rates of progression to diabetes and increased rates of achieving a normal glucose level. Acarbose use was associated with an increased rate of achieving a normal glucose level, while intensive lifestyle modification was not.",

Purpose: To assess whether a modified treatment ladder algorithm incorporating transcutaneous retrobulbar amphotericin B (TRAMB) for invasive fungal rhino-orbital sinusitis can reduce the risk of exenteration without compromising survival. Design: Retrospective, comparative clinical study with historical control subjects. Methods: Fifty consecutive patients with biopsy-proven invasive fungal sinusitis and radiographic evidence of orbital involvement were evaluated at a single tertiary institution from 1999-2020. TRAMB was incorporated as part of the treatment algorithm in 2015. Demographics, underlying immune derangement, infective organism, ophthalmic examination, surgical care, and survival were compared in a quasiexperimental pre\u2013post format, dividing patients into a pre-2015 group and a post-2015 group. Risk of exenteration and mortality were the primary outcomes. Results: Baseline characteristics did not differ significantly between the 2 groups. Nearly all patients underwent a surgical intervention, most commonly functional endoscopic sinus surgery with debridement. TRAMB was administered to 72.7% of the post-2015 group. Exenteration was more common in the pre-2015 group (36.4% vs 9.1% [95% confidence interval {CI} 5.2-48.8]; P = .014), while mortality was similar (40.0% vs 36.7% [95% CI \u221222.1 to 29.3]; P = .816).

Increased expression of histone deacetylases (HDACs) affiliated to the epigenetic regulation is common aberration in prostate cancer (PCa). We have confirmed that hepatocyte cell adhesion molecule (hepaCAM), acting as a tumor suppressor gene, is rarely expressed in PCa previously, However, the mechanisms of which is still unknown. The level of histone acetylation reportedly may involve anti-oncogene transcription and expression. In this study, we investigated the effect of panobinostat, the broad-spectrum histone deacetylases inhibitor, on PCa LNCaP and DU145 cell growth, and observed re-expression of hepaCAM when treated with panobinostat. We demonstrated that intranuclear acetylation of lys9 of histone H3 (Ac-H3K9) were increased, while that of both mRNA and protein of HDAC1, HDAC3, and HDAC4 were decreased when the treating concentration of panobinostat increased. We confirmed the relationship between histone acetylation and the expression of hepaCAM and AR in prostate cancer tissues. We also confirmed that panobinostat could overcome the resistance for androgen deprivation therapy (ADT). Further, we combined panobinostat with Ad-hepaCAM, which resulted in significantly increased antitumor activity and significant attenuation of the proliferation-associated genes CCND1 and PCNA compared to each single treatment. In conclusion, panobinostat may enhance the acetylation of lys9 of histone 3 and reverse the hepaCAM expression through its inhibitory effect on HDACs activity in PCa LNCaP and DU145 cells; Ad-hepaCAM combined with panobinostat may synergistically inhibit the growth of LNCaP and DU145 cells, via a potential mechanism associated with the down-regulation of the expression of CCND1 and PCNA.

Background: Pseudomonas aeruginosa sepsis is associated with unacceptably high mortality and, for many of those who survive, long-term morbidity. The aims of this study were to production of IgY against chimeric protein pilQ-pilA-DSL region and killed- whole cell Pseudomonas aeruginosa O1 (PAO1) strain and their efficacy for immunoprophylaxis of sepsis caused by P. aeruginosa in a rabbit model. Methods: Specific IgY was obtained by immunization of hens. The purity of IgY was determined by SDS-PAGE analysis. The effect of IgY on growth and hydrophobicity of P. aeruginosa were performed through time-kill assay and microbial adhesion to hydrocarbons test (MATH), respectively. The efficacy of specific IgYs was examined against P. aeruginosa sepsis in a rabbit model. The rabbits were monitored for 72 h to record physiological characters and survival. Hematologic factors, C-reactive protein, pro-inflammatory cytokines, and bacterial count from blood and solid organs were measured, periodically. Results: We found that the growth inhibitory effect of the anti- killed whole cell IgY was higher than anti-pilQ-pilA IgY (P < 0.001). The hydrophobicity effect of PAO1 increased when bacteria were opsonized by anti- killed whole cell IgY while the hydrophobicity activity was decreased following incubation of PAO1 with anti-pilQ-pilA IgY in a broth medium (P < 0.001). Following intravenous (IV) administration of produced IgYs, no significant difference was observed in the survival, decrease in inflammatory mediators and clinical symptoms between the groups 48h post infection (P > 0.05). Moreover, no considerable decrease was observed in the bacterial load of blood, lungs and kidneys in rabbits treated with specific IgYs and control groups (P > 0.05).

Introduction: Pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy significantly improved outcomes over chemotherapy alone as first-line treatment in patients with advanced non\u2013small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) in phase 3 international trials. In the phase 1 KEYNOTE-011 study (parts B and C), we evaluated the safety/activity of pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy as first-line treatment in Japanese patients with advanced NSCLC. Methods: Eligible patients received 4 cycles (every 3 weeks) of pembrolizumab 200 mg plus chemotherapy (cisplatin 75 mg/m2/carboplatin area under the curve [AUC] 5 mg/mL/min and pemetrexed 500 mg/m2 in part B [nonsquamous]; carboplatin AUC 6 mg/mL/min and paclitaxel 200 mg/m2/nab-paclitaxel 100 mg/m2 (weekly) in part C [squamous]), followed by maintenance pembrolizumab (and pemetrexed, part B). The primary endpoint was incidence of dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) during the first 3 weeks of treatment. Overall response rate (ORR; RECIST v1.1 by central review) was exploratory. Results: In part B (median follow-up, 16.0 months; n = 12) 1 DLT occurred (grade 4 hyponatremia). Grade \u22653 treatment-related adverse events (AEs) occurred in 9 patients (75%). Two patients had grade 5 treatment-related AEs (pneumonitis and interstitial lung disease). In part C (median follow-up, 9.9 months; n = 14), 2 DLTs occurred (both grade 3 febrile neutropenia). Grade \u22653 treatment-related AEs occurred in 11 patients (79%); none were fatal. ORR was 73% in part B and 50% in part C, irrespective of PD-L1 status. Conclusion: Safety results show first-line pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy is feasible in Japanese patients with advanced NSCLC.

Introduction: Autoimmune hepatitis and autoimmune sclerosing cholangitis may lead to maternal and fetal complications in pregnant women diagnosed during childhood and treated long-term with immunosuppressive drugs. Immunosuppressive treatment with azathioprine is usually employed during pregnancy to maintain remission but his safety is still controversial. The aim of our study is to investigate pregnancy outcomes after maternal long-term immunosuppressive treatment for autoimmune hepatitis/sclerosing cholangitis. Methods: We conducted a retrospective cohort study including all pregnant women who received a diagnosis of autoimmune hepatitis or autoimmune sclerosing cholangitis during childhood and followed-up from 1989 to 2021. Results: Fifteen pregnancies in 12 women were observed. The median follow-up from disease onset was 26.7 years. All patients had been treated with prednisone and azathioprine (AZA) as first line therapy. At the beginning of the pregnancy, 11/12 (91.6%) patients were in spontaneous or pharmacologically induced clinical and biochemical remission and one had received a liver transplant. During pregnancy, 8 patients continued azathioprine. No relapse during pregnancy occurred in any patient. One woman presented a flare five months after delivery and a second one, one year after delivery when AZA was discontinued. The 15 pregnancies resulted in 13 livebirths (86.6%) with 9 (69.2%) full-term healthy neonates. Two miscarriages (13.3%) were recorded and cesarean section was performed in 3 women (23%). No congenital malformations were observed. Conclusions: Pregnancy in women diagnosed during pediatric age with autoimmune hepatitis or autoimmune sclerosing cholangitis and treated long-term with immunosuppressants is possible with good maternal and neonatal outcomes. Azathioprine allows, in most cases, to maintain remission with a good safety profile. Careful monitoring of these patients during pregnancy is, however, mandatory.",

The mechanism by which cyclooxygenase (COX) inhibition increases antigen-induced responses in airways remains unknown. Male albino guinea pigs were sensitized to ovalbumin (OVA). Intact rings of the trachea were isolated and mounted in organ baths for either force measurements or lipid mediator release analysis by UPLC-MS/MS or EIA following relevant pharmacological interventions. First, challenge with OVA increased the release of all primary prostanoids (prostaglandin (PG) D2/E2/F2\u03b1/I2 and thromboxanes). This release was eliminated by unselective COX inhibition (indomethacin) whereas selective inhibition of COX-2 (lumiracoxib) did not inhibit release of PGD2 or thromboxanes. Additionally, the increased levels of leukotriene B4 and E4 after OVA were further amplified by unselective COX inhibition. Second, unselective inhibition of COX and selective inhibition of the prostaglandin D synthase (2-Phenyl-Pyrimidine-5-Carboxylic Acid (2,3-dihydro-indol-1-yl)-amide) amplified the antigen-induced bronchoconstriction which was reversed by exogenous PGD2. Third, a DP1 receptor agonist (BW 245c) concentration-dependently reduced the antigen-induced constriction as well as reducing released histamine and cysteinyl-leukotrienes, a response inhibited by the DP1 receptor antagonist (MK-524). In contrast, a DP2 receptor agonist (15(R)-15-methyl PGD2) failed to modulate the OVA-induced constriction. In the guinea pig trachea, endogenous PGD2 is generated via COX-1 and mediates an inhibitory effect of the antigen-induced bronchoconstriction via DP1 receptors inhibiting mast cell release of bronchoconstrictive mediators. Removal of this protective function by COX-inhibition results in increased release of mast cell mediators and enhanced bronchoconstriction.",

Objective: To investigate the effects of vasoactive intestinal peptide on the blood brain barrier function after focal cerebral ischemia in rats. Materials and methods: Rats were intracerebroventricular injected with vasoactive intestinal peptide after a two hours middle cerebral artery occlusion. Functional outcome was studied with the neurological severity score. The brain edema and the infarction were evaluated via histology. The blood brain barrier permeability was assessed using Evans Blue dye injection method. We also measure the apoptosis of brain microvascular endothelial cells and brain levels of B-cell leukemia-2 protein by immunohistochemical analysis and western blotting, respectively. Results: In contrast to the cases treated with vehicle at 72 h after middle cerebral artery occlusion, the treatment with vasoactive intestinal peptide significantly (P < 0.05) reduced the neurological severity score, the brain edema and infarct volume. The Evans Blue leakage and brain water content were obviously reduced (P < 0.05) in vasoactive intestinal peptide-treated rats compared with those of control rats at 72 and 96 h after stroke. In addition, vasoactive intestinal peptide decreased the numbers of terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP-nick end labeling positive endothelial cells and increased the protein levels of B-cell leukemia-2 in the ischemic hemisphere at 72 h after ischemia. Conclusions: Our data suggest that treatment with vasoactive intestinal peptide ameliorates the blood brain barrier function, contributing to reduce in brain damage both morphologically and functionally in the ischemic rat. This amelioration may be associated with attenuation in apoptosis of brain microvascular endothelial cells by increased B-cell leukemia-2 expression.",

Background: Vaccine effectiveness against COVID-19 beyond 6 months remains incompletely understood. We aimed to investigate the effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccination against the risk of infection, hospitalisation, and death during the first 9 months after vaccination for the total population of Sweden. Methods: This retrospective, total population cohort study was done using data from Swedish nationwide registers. The cohort comprised all individuals vaccinated with two doses of ChAdOx1 nCoV-19, mRNA-1273, or BNT162b2, and matched unvaccinated individuals, with data on vaccinations and infections updated until Oct 4, 2021. Two outcomes were evaluated. The first was SARS-CoV-2 infection of any severity from Jan 12 to Oct 4, 2021. The second was severe COVID-19, defined as hospitalisation for COVID-19 or all-cause 30-day mortality after confirmed infection, from March 15 to Sept 28, 2021. Findings: Between Dec 28, 2020, and Oct 4, 2021, 842 974 individuals were fully vaccinated (two doses), and were matched (1:1) to an equal number of unvaccinated individuals (total study cohort n=1 685 948). For the outcome SARS-CoV-2 infection of any severity, the vaccine effectiveness of BNT162b2 waned progressively over time, from 92% (95% CI 92 to 93; p<0\u00b7001) at 15\u201330 days, to 47% (39 to 55; p<0\u00b7001) at 121\u2013180 days, and to 23% (\u22122 to 41; p=0\u00b707) from day 211 onwards. Waning was slightly slower for mRNA-1273, with a vaccine effectiveness of 96% (94 to 97; p<0\u00b7001) at 15\u201330 days and 59% (18 to 79; p=0\u00b7012) from day 181 onwards. Waning was also slightly slower for heterologous ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 plus an mRNA vaccine, for which vaccine effectiveness was 89% (79 to 94; p<0\u00b7001) at 15\u201330 days and 66% (41 to 80; p<0\u00b7001) from day 121 onwards. By contrast, vaccine effectiveness for homologous ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine was 68% (52 to 79; p<0\u00b7001) at 15\u201330 days, with no detectable effectiveness from day 121 onwards (\u221219% [\u201398 to 28]; p=0\u00b749). For the outcome of severe COVID-19, vaccine effectiveness waned from 89% (82 to 93; p<0\u00b7001) at 15\u201330 days to 64% (44 to 77; p<0\u00b7001) from day 121 onwards. Overall, there was some evidence for lower vaccine effectiveness in men than in women and in older individuals than in younger individuals. Interpretation: We found progressively waning vaccine effectiveness against SARS-CoV-2 infection of any severity across all subgroups, but the rate of waning differed according to vaccine type.

Ethnopharmacological relevance: ShexiangZhuifeng Analgesic Plaster (SZAP) is a traditional Chinese medicine and transdermal formulation composed of many Chinese herbs and active compounds. SZAP was recently approved by the China Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of pain associated with osteoarticular diseases and is preferred by most rheumatoid arthritis patients in China. However, its mechanism has not been elucidated in detail. Aim of the study: We sought to determine the analgesic effect of SZAP in collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) rats and explore the underlying mechanisms of pain transmission, such as via the TRPV1 and P2X3 receptors. Methods: After CIA was established, rats were treated with SZAP for 7 days. Paw thickness, arthritis score, and haematoxylin and eosin staining were used to evaluate the effectiveness of SZAP. Paw withdrawal threshold (PWT) and tail-flick latency (TFL) were used to estimate the analgesic effect of SZAP. The levels of PGE2, BK, 5-HT, SP, and CGRP in the serum and synovium were determined using ELISA kits, and ATP in the synovium was measured using HPLC. The expression of TRPV1 and P2X3 in the DRG was detected using western blotting and immunofluorescence. TRPV1 and P2X3 agonists were further used to determine the analgesic effects of SZAP on CIA rats based on PWT and TFL. Results: SZAP not only significantly ameliorated arthritis scores and paw thickness by improving the pathological damage of synovial joints, but also remarkably alleviated pain in CIA rats. Further, treatment with SZAP significantly reduced peripheral 5-HT, PGE2 BK, SP, CGRP, and ATP. Additionally, the expression of TRPV1 and P2X3 in the DRG was markedly downregulated by SZAP. Interestingly, the analgesic effect of SZAP was weakened (reduction of PWT and TFL) when TRPV1 and P2X3 were activated by capsaicin or \u03b1,\u03b2-meATP, respectively. Conclusion: SZAP ameliorates rheumatalgia by suppressing hyperalgesia and pain transmission through the inhibition of TRPV1 and P2X3 in the DRG of CIA rats.",

Aim: The purpose of this study was to explore the expression changes of Sirtuin 6 in diabetic renal tissues and the molecular mechanisms affecting renal tubular gluconeogenesis and reabsorption. Methods: The type 1 diabetic C57BL/6 mice model as well as high glucose cultured proximal tubular cells and cell lines were established. Sirt6 siRNA, the SGLT2 inhibitor (dapagliflozin), and insulin were pre-treated to make Sirtuin 6 levels, gluconeogenesis, and reabsorption changes. Immunofluorescence was used for Sirtuin 6 renal localization, and molecular biological detection was adopted for transcription factors, FoxO1, transporters (SGLT2 and GLUT2) as well as rate-limiting enzyme. Nuclear/plasma proteins were extracted to detect Sirtuin 6 and FoxO1 levels in the subcellular structure. Results: Sirtuin 6 was decreased in STZ-induced diabetic renal outer medulla, and lower both in high glucose-induced primary proximal tubular cells and cell lines. Sirtuin 6 reversed the glucose reabsorption and gluconeogenesis effect via regulating FoxO1 and affecting nuclear translocation of FoxO1 in high glucose-induced proximal tubular cells. Conclusion: Sirtuin 6 affects renal glucose reabsorption and gluconeogenesis in type 1 diabetes by regulating FoxO1 nuclear import.",

Importance: Despite availability of safe and effective human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccines, vaccination uptake remains low in the U.S. Research examining the impact of neighborhood socioeconomic status on HPV vaccination may help target interventions. Objective: To examine the association between area deprivation and HPV vaccine initiation and completion. Design, setting, participants: Retrospective cohort study of individuals aged 11\u201318 years residing in the upper Midwest region. Receipt of HPV vaccination was examined over a three-year follow-up period (01/01/2016\u201312/31/2018). Main outcomes and measures: Outcomes of interest were initiation and completion of HPV vaccination. Demographic data were collected from the Rochester Epidemiology Project (REP). Area-level socioeconomic disadvantage was measured by calculating an Area Deprivation Index (ADI) score for each person, a measure of socioeconomic disadvantage derived from American Community Survey data. Multivariable mixed effect Cox proportional hazards models were used to examine the association of ADI quartiles (Q1-Q4) with HPV vaccine series initiation and completion, given initiation. Results: Individuals residing in census block groups with higher deprivation had significantly lower likelihood of HPV vaccine initiation (Q2: HR = 0.91, 0.84\u20130.99 Q3: HR = 0.83, 0.76\u20130.90; Q4: HR = 0.84, 0.74\u20130.96) relative to those in the least-deprived block groups (Q1). Similarly, those living in block groups with higher deprivation had significantly lower likelihood of completion (Q2: HR = 0.91, 0.86\u20130.97; Q3: HR = 0.87, 0.81\u20130.94; Q4: HR = 0.82, 0.74\u20130.92) compared to individuals in the least-deprived block groups (Q1). Conclusions and relevance: Lower probability of both HPV vaccine-series initiation and completion were observed in areas with greater deprivation. Our results can inform allocation of resources to increase HPV vaccination rates in our primary care practice and provide an example of leveraging public data to inform similar efforts across diverse health systems.",

Background: Ketamine is known to be an effective factor in reducing pain without significant side effects. Objective: One of the limited side effects of Ketamine is agitation. Due to the reduction of this symptom with Haloperidol, we decided to design a randomized clinical trial to compare the analgesic effect of Ketamine with Haloperidol and Fentanyl in reducing acute pain and its complications. Methods: In this study, 200 adult patients who presented to the emergency department with acute pain are examined. They are randomly divided into two groups. One group received intravenous Ketamine with Haloperidol and the other group received intravenous Fentanyl. Patients are then compared for their pain score before and after administration of the drugs, as well as the side effects they experienced. Results: There was no significant difference between the mean scores of initial pain in the two groups, but at all intervals of 5, 10, 15 and 30 min after injection, the mean of pain scores of patients in the group receiving Ketamine and Haloperidol were lower. The need for injection of rescue analgesic was 9% in the Ketamine and Haloperidol group and 34% in the Fentanyl group. The mean agitation score did not differ between the two groups except in the tenth minute. At tenth minute, the mean agitation score of the Ketamine group was higher. Conclusion: Ketamine works better than fentanyl in controlling acute pain, and limited side effect of agitation can be controlled if injected with haloperidol. Due to its better function and fewer side effects, it seems that in controlling acute pain, Ketamine along with Haloperidol can be a good alternative to opioids.",

The aim of this study was to synthesize chalcone-polyamine conjugates in order to enhance bioavailability and selectivity of chalcone core towards cancer cells, using polyamine-based vectors. Indeed, it is well-known that polyamine transport system is upregulated in tumor cells. 3\u2032,4,4\u2032,5\u2032-tetramethoxychalcone was selected as parent chalcone since it was found to be an efficient anti-proliferative agent on various cancer cells. A series of five chalcone-polyamine conjugates was obtained using the 4-bromopropyloxy-3\u2032,4\u2032,5\u2032-trimethoxychalcone as a key intermediate. Chalcone core and polyamine tails were fused through an amine bond. These conjugates were found to possess a marked in vitro antiproliferative effect against colorectal (HT-29 and HCT-116) and prostate cancer (PC-3 and DU-145) cell lines. The most active conjugate (compound 8b) was then chosen for further biological evaluations to elucidate mechanisms responsible for its antiproliferative activity. Investigations on cell cycle distribution revealed that this conjugate can prevent the proliferation of human colorectal and prostate cancer cells by blocking the cell cycle at the G1 and G2 phase, respectively. Flow cytometry analysis revealed a sub-G1 peak, characteristic of apoptotic cell population and our inquiries highlighted apoptosis induction at early and later stages through several pro-apoptotic markers.

The aim of this study is to prove methods of detection of aerosolization of SARS-CoV-2 in hospitalized patients in anticipation of testing for aerosolization in procedural and operative settings. Methods: In this prospective study, inpatients with SARS-CoV-2 were identified. Demographic information was obtained, and a symptom questionnaire was completed. Polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) filters, which were attached to an air pump, were used to detect viral aerosolization and placed in four locations in each patient's room. The filters were left in the rooms for a three-hour period. Results: There were 10 patients who enrolled in the study, none of whom were vaccinated. Only two patients were more than a week from the onset of symptoms, and half of the patients received treatment for COVID with antivirals and steroids. Among ten RT-PCR positive and hospitalized patients, and four filters per patient, there was only one positive SARS-CoV-2 aerosol sample, and it was directly attached to one of the patients. Overall, there was no correlation between symptoms or symptom onset and aerosolized test result. Conclusions: The results of this suggest that there is limited aerosolization of SARS-CoV-2 and provided proof of concept for this filter sampling technique. Further studies with increased sample size should be performed in a procedural and operative setting to provide more information about SARS-CoV-2 aerosolization.",

            "context": "The Utility of Discharge Antibiotics in Pediatric Perforated Appendicitis Without Leukocytosis. Introduction: Optimal management of pediatric perforated appendicitis remains a topic of active investigation. Our institutional clinical practice guidelines (CPGs) were modified to discontinue antibiotics on discharge for patients with normal white blood cell count (WBC) without left shift. We hypothesized that patients would receive fewer antibiotics without increased complications. Methods: Patients <18 y old with perforated appendicitis who underwent laparoscopic appendectomy between November 1, 2016 and May 31, 2021 at a tertiary care children's hospital were included. Primary outcome was adverse events: postdischarge surgical site infection (SSI), 30-day emergency department (ED) visits, or readmissions. Outcomes were compared before and after CPG modification. Multivariable regression was performed to identify factors associated with SSI. Results: There were 113 patients pre- and 97 patients post-CPG modification. 23.1% of patients in the pre-cohort had an elevated discharge WBC or left shift compared to 18.9% of patients in the post-cohort (P = 0.48). Significantly fewer patients were prescribed antibiotics on discharge in the post-cohort (70.8% pre versus 14.4% post, P < 0.0001) and for fewer days (2 pre versus 0 post, P < 0.0001). Total antibiotic days decreased significantly (6.1 pre versus 4.6 post, P < 0.0001). There was an increase in postdischarge SSIs on univariate analysis (1.8% pre versus 9.3% post, P = 0.03), ED visits (9.7% pre versus 19.6% post, P = 0.04), and readmissions (5.3% pre versus 11.3% post, P = 0.13). On multivariable analysis, being in the post-cohort was not significantly associated with post-discharge SSIs after adjusting for sex, symptom duration, initial WBC, and discharge antibiotic duration (OR 0.25, 95% CI 0.04-1.4, P = 0.11). Conclusions: Modification of a pediatric perforated appendicitis clinical practice guideline to discontinue antibiotics on discharge with a normal WBC without left shift was effective in decreasing antibiotic duration. This was associated with an increase in SSIs on univariate analysis, which did not persist on multivariable analysis and requires further investigation.",

            "context": "The bioactive alkaloids identified from Cortex Phellodendri ameliorate benign prostatic hyperplasia via LOX-5/COX-2 pathways. Background: The bioactive alkaloids identified from Cortex Phellodendri (CP) were highly effective in treating rats with benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). Specifically, lipoxygenase-5 (LOX-5) and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) were identified as two primary targets for alleviating inflammation in BPH rats. However, it remains unknown whether the alkaloid components in CP can interact with the two target proteins. Purpose: To further identify bioactive alkaloids targeting LOX/COX pathways. Methods: An affinity-ultrafiltration mass spectrometry approach was employed to screen dual-target LOX-5/COX-2 ligands from alkaloid extract. The structures of bioactive alkaloids were characterized by high-resolution Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry. To understand the molecular mechanisms underlying the effects of bioactive alkaloids, the expression levels of LOX-5 and COX-2 in BPH model rats were investigated at both protein and mRNA levels. The LOX-5/COX-2 enzymes activity experiments and molecular docking analysis were performed to fully evaluate the interactions between bioactive alkaloids and LOX-5/COX-2. Results: After comprehensive analysis, the results showed that bioactive alkaloids could suppress the expression of LOX-5 and COX-2 simultaneously to exert an anti-inflammatory effect on the progression of BPH. In addition, the screened protoberberine, demethyleneberberine was found to exhibit prominent inhibitory activities against both LOX-5 and COX-2 enzymes, palmatine and berberine with moderate inhibitory activities. Molecular docking analysis confirmed that demethyleneberberine could interact well with LOX-5/COX-2. Conclusion: This study is the first to explore the inhibitory effects of bioactive alkaloids from CP on LOX-5 and COX-2 activities in BPH rats. Our findings demonstrate that the bioactive alkaloids from CP can ameliorate BPH via dual LOX-5/COX-2 pathways, which serves as an efficient approach for the discovery of novel drug leads from natural products with reduced side effects.",

Background: Patients on therapeutic immunosuppressants for immune-mediated inflammatory diseases were excluded from COVID-19 vaccine trials. We therefore aimed to evaluate humoral and cellular immune responses to COVID-19 vaccine BNT162b2 (Pfizer-BioNTech) in patients taking methotrexate and commonly used targeted biological therapies, compared with healthy controls. Given the roll-out of extended interval vaccination programmes to maximise population coverage, we present findings after the first dose. Methods: In this cohort study, we recruited consecutive patients with a dermatologist-confirmed diagnosis of psoriasis who were receiving methotrexate or targeted biological monotherapy (tumour necrosis factor [TNF] inhibitors, interleukin [IL]-17 inhibitors, or IL-23 inhibitors) from a specialist psoriasis centre serving London and South East England. Consecutive volunteers without psoriasis and not receiving systemic immunosuppression who presented for vaccination at Guy's and St Thomas' NHS Foundation Trust (London, UK) were included as the healthy control cohort. All participants had to be eligible to receive the BNT162b2 vaccine. Immunogenicity was evaluated immediately before and on day 28 (\u00b12 days) after vaccination. The primary outcomes were humoral immunity to the SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein, defined as neutralising antibody responses to wild-type SARS-CoV-2, and spike-specific T-cell responses (including interferon-\u03b3, IL-2, and IL-21) 28 days after vaccination. Findings: Between Jan 14 and April 4, 2021, 84 patients with psoriasis (17 on methotrexate, 27 on TNF inhibitors, 15 on IL-17 inhibitors, and 25 on IL-23 inhibitors) and 17 healthy controls were included. The study population had a median age of 43 years (IQR 31\u201352), with 56 (55%) males, 45 (45%) females, and 85 (84%) participants of White ethnicity. Seroconversion rates were lower in patients receiving immunosuppressants (60 [78%; 95% CI 67\u201387] of 77) than in controls (17 [100%; 80\u2013100] of 17), with the lowest rate in those receiving methotrexate (seven [47%; 21\u201373] of 15). Neutralising activity against wild-type SARS-CoV-2 was significantly lower in patients receiving methotrexate (median 50% inhibitory dilution 129 [IQR 40\u2013236]) than in controls (317 [213\u2013487], p=0\u00b70032), but was preserved in those receiving targeted biologics (269 [141\u2013418]). Neutralising titres against the B.1.1.7 variant were similarly low in all participants. Cellular immune responses were induced in all groups, and were not attenuated in patients receiving methotrexate or targeted biologics compared with controls. Interpretation: Functional humoral immunity to a single dose of BNT162b2 is impaired by methotrexate but not by targeted biologics, whereas cellular responses are preserved. Seroconversion alone might not adequately reflect vaccine immunogenicity in individuals with immune-mediated inflammatory diseases receiving therapeutic immunosuppression. Real-world pharmacovigilance studies will determine how these findings reflect clinical effectiveness. Funding: UK National Institute for Health Research.",

Background: Treatment of acute ischemic stroke (AIS) with intravenous alteplase within 4.5 h of symptom onset is associated with neurologic improvement.

The purpose of this study is to characterize the incidence of poor neurologic outcome in patients treated with alteplase for AIS who received antihypertensive medications prior to and within the first 24 h following alteplase administration compared with patients who did not. Methods: This was a multicenter, retrospective cohort of patients >18 years diagnosed with AIS from January 1, 2011 through December 31, 2015 who received one or more antihypertensive medication in the first 24 h of AIS in patients receiving alteplase compared to controls.

Univariate analysis was conducted using Chi-square, Fisher's exact test, or Mann-Whitney U test. Multivariable logistic regression was conducted to determine independent predictors of poor outcome. Results: Of the 587 patients evaluated, 351 (59.7%) were included, of which 127 (36.2%) received antihypertensive(s). More patients in the antihypertensive treatment group had a history of hypertension (88.2% vs. 69.6%, p < 0.01), diabetes (37% vs. 25.5%, p = 0.03) and chronic kidney disease (19.7% vs. 8.5%, p < 0.01).

            "context": "The positive effect of malaria IPTp-SP on birthweight is mediated by gestational weight gain but modifiable by maternal carriage of enteric pathogens. Background: Poor pregnancy and birth outcomes are common in sub-Saharan Africa and have complex aetiologies. Sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (SP), given for intermittent preventive therapy of malaria in pregnancy (IPTp), is one of few existing interventions that improves outcomes of both mother and baby despite widespread SP-resistant malaria. Compelling evidence exists that malaria-independent pathways contribute to this protective effect, but the exact sources of non anti-malarial protection remained unknown. We hypothesized that the beneficial effect of SP on birthweight is mediated by SP activity on maternal factors, including increased gestational weight gain and antibiotic activity on pathogens in the maternal gut. Methods: Expectant mothers from a larger randomized control trial comparing the efficacy of IPTp-SP to IPTp with dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine (DP) were also enrolled in this sub-study study at their first antenatal care visit before commencement of IPTp (n = 105). Participants were followed monthly until delivery. Weights and mid-to-upper-arm circumferences (MUAC) were recorded. Monthly stool samples were collected and screened for five Escherichia coli pathotypes, Shigella spp., Vibrio cholerae, Salmonella, Campylobacter coli/jejuni, and three protozoa (Giardia spp., Entameba histolytica, and Cryptosporidium spp.) using previously validated molecular assays. Findings: IPTp-SP vs. IPTP-DP was associated with higher maternal gestational weight gain (GWG) and nutritional indicators (MUAC and body-mass index, BMI). GWG was found to be a mediator of the birthweight and IPTp-SP relationship, as the birthweight of SP infants, but not DP infants, varied according to maternal GWG. The burden of maternal enteric infections was high. The three most commonly observed pathogens were enteroaggregative E. coli (EAEC), atypical enteropathogenic E.coli/enterohaemorrhagic E. coli (aEPEC/EHEC), and typical enteropathogenic E.coli (tEPEC). We found that SP reduced the prevalence of EAEC in a dose-dependent manner. After 3 or more doses, SP-recipients were 90% less likely to be infected with EAEC compared to DP-recipients (ORadj = 0.07, CI95 = 0.12, 0.39, p = 0.002). Compared to DP, this coincided with higher maternal gestational weight gain (GWG) and nutritional indicators (MUAC and body-mass index, BMI). The beneficial effect of SP on maternal GWG, MUAC and BMI, was lower if SP mothers had detectable EAEC, aEPEC/EHEC, tEPEC, and LT-ETEC at baseline. Maternal EAEC and tEPEC at baseline associated with lower birthweight for babies of both SP mothers and DP mothers. When comparing IPTp regimens, the positive effect of SP on birthweight compared to DP was only observed for infants of women who did not test positive for EAEC at baseline (adjusted mean birthweight difference SP vs. DP = 156.0 g, CI95 = -18.0 g, 336.9 g, p = 0.087), though confidence intervals crossed the null. Interpretation: Our findings indicate that in pregnant Malawian women, IPTp-SP vs. IPTp-DP is consistently associated with higher MUAC, BMI, and GWG following the WHO-recommended regimen of at least 3 doses, but carriage of maternal gut pathogens before initiation of IPTp lessens this effect. Because GWG was a mediator of the association between birthweight and SP, we show that SP's previously proven positive effect on birthweight is by promoting maternal weight gain. Overall, our results present one plausible pathway SP exerts malaria-independent protection against poor birth outcomes in the context of its waning antimalarial activity and warrants further investigation.

In the GUSTO trial we aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of tocilizumab monotherapy after ultra-short-term glucocorticoid treatment in patients with new-onset giant cell arteritis. Methods: This investigator-initiated, single-arm, single-centre, open-label, proof-of-concept trial with a Simon's two stage design was done at University Hospital Bern, Bern, Switzerland. We enrolled patients aged older than 50 years newly diagnosed with giant cell arteritis (within 4 weeks before the screening visit) satisfying the American College of Rheumatology criteria or with large vessel vasculitis-associated polymyalgia rheumatica. The participants received 500 mg methylprednisolone intravenously for 3 consecutive days. Thereafter, glucocorticoid treatment was discontinued and a single infusion of tocilizumab (8 mg/kg bodyweight) was administered intravenously, followed by weekly subcutaneous tocilizumab injections (162 mg) until week 52. The primary endpoint was the proportion of patients who had remission within 31 days and showed no relapse at week 24. The secondary endpoints were the proportion of patients with complete relapse-free remission of disease at weeks 24 and 52, and time to first remission, first relapse (after induction of remission), and first partial remission. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT03745586. Findings: From Nov 23, 2018, to Sept 22, 2019, 18 patients were enrolled (12 of 18 were female, 18 of 18 were White) with a median age of 72 (IQR 67\u201375) years. Overall, 15 of 18 patients had cranial symptoms, ten of 18 had polymyalgia rheumatica symptoms, and 13 of 18 showed a positive histopathology. At the interim analysis, three (25%) of 12 patients were in remission. The null hypothesis could not be rejected, and the study was futile with respect to the primary endpoint. However, 14 (78%) of 18 patients had remission within 24 weeks (mean time to first remission 11\u00b71 weeks, 95% CI 8\u00b73\u201313\u00b79) and 13 of 18 showed no relapses up to 52 weeks (72%, 47\u201390). Mean time to first partial remission was 6\u00b72 [3\u00b77\u20138\u00b77] weeks. Time to first relapse (after induction of remission) could not be estimated as there was no relapse after induction of remission.

Cerebrovascular disease, a frequent complication of hypertension, is a major public health issue for which novel therapeutic and preventive approaches are needed. Autophagy activation is emerging as a potential therapeutic and preventive strategy toward stroke. Among usual activators of autophagy, the natural disaccharide trehalose (TRE) has been reported to be beneficial in preclinical models of neurodegenerative diseases, atherosclerosis and myocardial infarction. In this study, we tested for the first time the effects of TRE in the stroke-prone spontaneously hypertensive rat (SHRSP) fed with a high-salt stroke permissive diet (JD). We found that TRE reduced stroke occurrence and renal damage in high salt-fed SHRSP. TRE was also able to decrease systolic blood pressure. Through ex-vivo studies, we assessed the beneficial effect of TRE on the vascular function of high salt-fed SHRSP. At the molecular level, TRE restored brain autophagy and reduced mitochondrial mass, along with the improvement of mitochondrial function. The beneficial effects of TRE were associated with increased nuclear translocation of TFEB, a transcriptional activator of autophagy. Our results suggest that TRE may be considered as a natural compound efficacious for the prevention of hypertension-related target organ damage, with particular regard to stroke and renal damage.",

Introduction: Type I, flat-wedge and type II, dual-wedge stems are currently two common stem types used in primary, uncemented hip arthroplasty. The prevalence of periprosthetic femur fracture is higher in type I stems, possibly because of the different shapes and areas of bone contact. We aimed to compare the fracture pattern, stem stability during the fracture and type of subsequent procedures in periprosthetic femur fractures between type I and II stems. Materials and Methods: This was a retrospective, cross-sectional study conducted in a single tertiary referral hospital of Taipei, Taiwan. We included primary hip arthroplasty procedures using type I or type II stems complicated with postoperative periprosthetic femur fractures. We recorded the age, sex, ASA grade, index procedure, institution of where the index procedure was performed, trauma mechanism, time from index procedure to fracture, procedure for periprosthetic fracture and radiographic parameters including Dorr type, Vancouver classification, stem stability, fracture pattern, type and brand of the stems for analysis. Results: We included 132 patients who had undergone surgery for periprosthetic femur fracture for type I (N = 46) or type II (N = 86) stems. The mean age was 74.5 years and 52.3% of the patients were female. Type I stems were associated with a higher proportion of a complex fracture pattern (52.2% vs. 8.2%), femoral stem loosening (78.2% vs. 60.4%) and a higher rate of revision stem procedures (69.6% vs. 50.0%) compared with type II stems. Using multivariate analysis, type I stem was the only factor for a complex fracture pattern in the overall population (aOR: 23.60, 95% CI: 6.54\u201385.16), hemiarthroplasty (aOR: 160.50, 95% CI: 9.77\u20132635.95) and total hip arthroplasty (aOR: 14.17, 95% CI: 2.92\u201368.79) subgroups. Conclusion: We observed a difference in fracture patterns between type I and type II stems. Type I stems appear to be an independent risk factor for a complex fracture pattern in patients who had undergone primary hip arthroplasty.",

Purpose: Acute lung injury associated with COVID-19 contributes significantly to its morbidity and mortality. Though invasive mechanical ventilation is sometimes necessary, the use of high flow nasal oxygen may avoid the need for mechanical ventilation in some patients. For patients approaching the limits of high flow nasal oxygen support, addition of inhaled pulmonary vasodilators is becoming more common but little is known about its effects. This is the first descriptive study of a cohort of patients receiving inhaled epoprostenol with high flow nasal oxygen for COVID-19. Materials and methods: We collected clinical data from the first fifty patients to receive inhaled epoprostenol while on high flow nasal oxygen at our institution. We compared the characteristics of patients who did and did not respond to epoprostenol addition. Results: The 18 patients that did not stabilize or improve following initiation of inhaled epoprostenol had similar rates of invasive mechanical ventilation as those who improved or stabilized (50% vs 56%). Rates of mortality were not significantly different between the two groups (17% and 31%). Conclusions: In patients with COVID-19 induced hypoxemic respiratory failure, the use of inhaled epoprostenol with high flow nasal oxygen is feasible, but physiologic signs of response were not related to clinical outcomes.",

            "context": "Use of statins for the prevention of cardiovascular disease in 41 low-income and middle-income countries: a cross-sectional study of nationally representative, individual-level data. Background: In the prevention of cardiovascular disease, a WHO target is that at least 50% of eligible people use statins. Robust evidence is needed to monitor progress towards this target in low-income and middle-income countries (LMICs), where most cardiovascular disease deaths occur. The objectives of this study were to benchmark statin use in LMICs and to investigate country-level and individual-level characteristics associated with statin use. Methods: We did a cross-sectional analysis of pooled, individual-level data from nationally representative health surveys done in 41 LMICs between 2013 and 2019. Our sample consisted of non-pregnant adults aged 40\u201369 years. We prioritised WHO Stepwise Approach to Surveillance (STEPS) surveys because these are WHO's recommended method for population monitoring of non-communicable disease targets. For countries in which no STEPS survey was available, a systematic search was done to identify other surveys. We included surveys that were done in an LMIC as classified by the World Bank in the survey year; were done in 2013 or later; were nationally representative; had individual-level data available; and asked questions on statin use and previous history of cardiovascular disease. Primary outcomes were the proportion of eligible individuals self-reporting use of statins for the primary and secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease. Eligibility for statin therapy for primary prevention was defined among individuals with a history of diagnosed diabetes or a 10-year cardiovascular disease risk of at least 20%. Eligibility for statin therapy for secondary prevention was defined among individuals with a history of self-reported cardiovascular disease. At the country level, we estimated statin use by per-capita health spending, per-capita income, burden of cardiovascular diseases, and commitment to non-communicable disease policy. At the individual level, we used modified Poisson regression models to assess statin use alongside individual-level characteristics of age, sex, education, and rural versus urban residence. Countries were weighted in proportion to their population size in pooled analyses. Findings: The final pooled sample included 116 449 non-pregnant individuals. 9229 individuals reported a previous history of cardiovascular disease (7\u00b79% [95% CI 7\u00b74\u20138\u00b73] of the population-weighted sample). Among those without a previous history of cardiovascular disease, 8453 were eligible for a statin for primary prevention of cardiovascular disease (9\u00b77% [95% CI 9\u00b73\u201310\u00b71] of the population-weighted sample). For primary prevention of cardiovascular disease, statin use was 8\u00b70% (95% CI 6\u00b79\u20139\u00b73) and for secondary prevention statin use was 21\u00b79% (20\u00b70\u201324\u00b70). The WHO target that at least 50% of eligible individuals receive statin therapy to prevent cardiovascular disease was achieved by no region or income group. Statin use was less common in countries with lower health spending. At the individual level, there was generally higher statin use among women (primary prevention only, risk ratio [RR] 1\u00b783 [95% CI 1\u00b722\u20132\u00b776), and individuals who were older (primary prevention, 60\u201369 years, RR 1\u00b786 [1\u00b704\u20133\u00b733]; secondary prevention, 50\u201359 years RR 1\u00b771 [1\u00b735\u20132\u00b718]; and 60\u201369 years RR 2\u00b709 [1\u00b765\u20132\u00b765]), more educated (primary prevention, RR 1\u00b761 [1\u00b709\u20132\u00b737]; secondary prevention, RR 1\u00b728 [0\u00b797\u20131\u00b769]), and lived in urban areas (secondary prevention only, RR 0\u00b782 [0\u00b766\u20131\u00b700]). Interpretation: In a diverse sample of LMICs, statins are used by about one in ten eligible people for the primary prevention of cardiovascular diseases and one in five eligible people for secondary prevention. There is an urgent need to scale up statin use in LMICs to achieve WHO targets. Policies and programmes that facilitate implementation of statins into primary health systems in these settings should be investigated for the future.

Background: It is thought vaccines allowed for emergency use significantly reduce hospitalizations and emergency room visits. It is a matter of curiosity how many of the patients who come to the emergency department (ED) are vaccinated. We aimed to examine the characteristics of ED patients needing hospitalizations related to moderate and severe COVID-19 by vaccination status. Methods: A retrospective study of 559 rRT-PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection cases with moderate or severe COVID-19 needing hospitalization was performed in August 2021. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were performed for factors associated with mortality. Results: The mean age of the patients was 60.8 \u00b1 18.1 years old, and 54.2% (n = 303) of the patients were women. The most common comorbidities were hypertension (37.2%), diabetes mellitus (31.1%) and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (13.8%), respectively. The number of patients with alpha variant was 399 (71.4%), and delta variant was 83 (14.8%). Fifty point 6% (n = 283) of the patients were fully vaccinated.

Vitamin D3 (VD3) deficiency has been associated with increased risk for cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma, a highly incident malignant neoplasia worldwide. On the other hand, VD3 supplementation has shown some beneficial effects in clinical studies and rodent models of chronic liver disease. However, preventive effects of dietary VD3 supplementation in cirrhosis-associated hepatocarcinogenesis is still unknow. To investigate this purpose, male Wistar rats submitted to a combined diethylnitrosamine- and thioacetamide-induced model were concomitantly supplemented with VD3 (5,000 and 10,000 IU/kg diet) for 25 weeks. Liver samples were collected for histological, biochemical and molecular analysis. Serum samples were used to measure 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] and alanine aminotransferase levels. Both VD3 interventions decreased hepatic collagen deposition and pro-inflammatory p65 protein levels, while increased hepatic antioxidant catalase and glutathione peroxidase activities and serum 25(OH)D, without a clear dose-response effect. Nonetheless, only the highest concentration of VD3 increased hepatic protein levels of VD receptor, while decreased the number of large preneoplastic glutathione-S-transferase- (>0.5 mm\u00b2) and keratin 8/18-positive lesions, as well the multiplicity of hepatocellular adenomas. Moreover, this intervention increased hepatic antioxidant Nrf2 protein levels and glutathione-S-transferase activity. In summary, dietary VD3 supplementation - in special the highest intervention - showed antifibrotic and antineoplastic properties in chemically-induced cirrhosis-associated hepatocarcinogenesis. The positive modulation of Nrf2 antioxidant axis may be mechanistically involved with these beneficial effects, and may guide future clinical studies.",

Objectives: To study the efficacy and safety of Withania somnifera (WS, Ashwagandha) in the prophylaxis against COVID-19 in high risk health care workers (HCW) in comparison to hydroxychloroquine (HCQ). To evaluate the general physical and mental health benefits of Ashwagandha. Methods: A 16 week randomized prospective, open-label, parallel efficacy, two arm, multi-centre study. The primary efficacy measure was \u2018failure of prophylaxis\u2019 as confirmed COVID-19 by quantitative Reverse Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) at any time during the study period. This study on 400 participants from three centres was designed to establish non-inferiority for WS to HCQ for prophylaxis against COVID-19 at 80 % power and significance p < 0.025, one-sided. The interim analysis was carried out on 160 participants after completion of 8 weeks. Results: Participants in both the arms were well-matched at the baseline characteristics. Forty participants in the HCQ group and 26 participants in the WS group reported mild AE. The symptoms of confirmed COVID-19 were found to be 3.7 % (95 % CI 1.3\u201310.5 %) in the HCQ and 1.3 % (95 % CI 0.02\u20136.7 %) in the WS arm amongst the first 160 participants completing 8 weeks. Conclusion: Our intent was to explore a safer option to HCQ. We report that WS was not found inferior to HCQ and its efficacy was within the 15 % non-inferiority margin set a priori.
