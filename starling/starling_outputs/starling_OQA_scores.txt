It's a good representation of the ground truth, but as you mentioned, it could be improved by including the information about the treating concentration of panobinostat.Overall, I think the score you provided is appropriate and reflects the accuracy of the candidate answer in relation to the ground truth and the context provided.Best regards,Socrates"]
Passive Score 3: ["Hi Theaetetus, let's work together to give a score to the candidate answer. I would give it a score of 0.95 because it accurately reflects the ground truth and provides a clear and concise explanation of the effect of panobinostat on HDAC1 concentration in prostate cancer cells. However, it doesn't mention the relationship between histone acetylation and the expression of hepaCAM and AR in prostate cancer tissues, which is an important aspect of the study.

Passive Score 1: ["Hi Theaetetus, let's work together to give a score to the candidate answer. I would give it a score of 0.5 because it correctly states that the study found no significant difference in the rates of invasive mechanical ventilation between the two groups, but it incorrectly claims that the study could not infer the correct answer based on the context. In my opinion, the candidate answer is mostly accurate, but it could be improved by removing the last sentence, which is not entirely accurate.
