Output format: {'drug' : [drug1, ..., drugN]} GPT4 Correct Assistant: Yes, the drugs can be inferred from the text. However, the text does not directly mention the names of the drugs. Instead, it refers to "two peptidomimetics of SOCS1." To determine the names of the drugs, additional information or context would be needed. Therefore, the output format should be:
{'drug': ["Unknown 1", "Unknown 2"]}

The following drugs were found in the given text: 'peptidomimetics', 'SOCS1'.
