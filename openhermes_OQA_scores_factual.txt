Background: Sialorrhea in spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) is caused by bulbar weakness, which is aggravated by low oromotor tone rather than saliva overproduction. Botulinum toxin (BTX) reduces sialorrhea by preventing acetylcholine release from the presynaptic secretory parasympathetic nerve terminals. An important adverse effect of BTX, as highlighted in its black box warning, is a systemic spread of BTX leading to botulism-like symptoms including dysphagia, muscle weakness, and death. These symptoms may be more pronounced in peripheral motor neuropathic disorder population such as SMA, whose neuromuscular junction (NMJ) is already dysfunctional. Methods: We report a case of a 17-month-old boy with SMA type 1 following BTX injection for the treatment of sialorrhea. Results: The boy developed severe generalized hypotonia, profound dysphagia, decreased airway clearance, and speech difficulty following BTX injection. Full gastric feeding was required. Pyridostigmine was started but with minimal effect. The patient experienced prolonged deleterious side effects of BTX, lasting upward of a year with very slow recovery of limb strengths and oromotor tone. Conclusions: NMJ dysfunction has been well described in SMA. BTX may exacerbate fragile NMJ function by inhibiting acetylcholine release at the presynaptic vesicles. As such, systematic intoxication of BTX can have far-reaching consequences in this population. A strong precaution and cautious weighing of efficacy and risk must be performed before utilizing BTX in the SMA population.]"Question: "[What were the adverse events due to Onabotulinum Toxin A?]"Ground Truth: "[severe generalized hypotonia, profound dysphagia, decreased airway clearance, and speech difficulty]"Candidate Answer: "[adverse events due to onabotulinum toxin a include generalized hypotonia, profound dysphagia, decreased airway clearance, speech difficulty, prolonged deleterious side effects, and exacerbation of fragile nmj function.]"Prediction: [factual]Theaetetus, what is your opinion on the factuality of the candidate answer given the context, the question, and the ground truth?', ' [factual]Explanation: The candidate answer provides a comprehensive list of the adverse events due to Onabotulinum Toxin A, including the ones mentioned in the ground truth (severe generalized hypotonia, profound dysphagia, decreased airway clearance, and speech difficulty).

Background: Sialorrhea in spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) is caused by bulbar weakness, which is aggravated by low oromotor tone rather than saliva overproduction. Botulinum toxin (BTX) reduces sialorrhea by preventing acetylcholine release from the presynaptic secretory parasympathetic nerve terminals. An important adverse effect of BTX, as highlighted in its black box warning, is a systemic spread of BTX leading to botulism-like symptoms including dysphagia, muscle weakness, and death. These symptoms may be more pronounced in peripheral motor neuropathic disorder population such as SMA, whose neuromuscular junction (NMJ) is already dysfunctional. Methods: We report a case of a 17-month-old boy with SMA type 1 following BTX injection for the treatment of sialorrhea. Results: The boy developed severe generalized hypotonia, profound dysphagia, decreased airway clearance, and speech difficulty following BTX injection. Full gastric feeding was required. Pyridostigmine was started but with minimal effect.

Methods: This study investigated the effects of BBR on intestinal bacteria and the inflammatory response in dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced colitis mice. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) and electron microscopy were used to detect intestinal TJs. Microflora analysis was used to screen for bacteria regulated by BBR.

However, the mechanism by which BBR affects intestinal bacteria and immunity is still unclear. Methods: This study investigated the effects of BBR on intestinal bacteria and the inflammatory response in dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced colitis mice. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) and electron microscopy were used to detect intestinal TJs. Microflora analysis was used to screen for bacteria regulated by BBR. Results: The results showed that BBR had increased colonic epithelium zonula occludens proteins-1 (ZO-1) and occludin expression and reduced T-helper 17/T regulatory ratio in DSS-induced mice. Mechanically, BBR eliminated DSS-induced intestinal flora disturbances in mice, particularly increased Bacteroides fragilis (B. fragilis) in vivo and in vitro. B. fragilis decreased the interleukin-6 induced by dendritic cells through some heat-resistant component rather than nucleic acids or proteins.

Objective: To compare key seizure and outcome characteristics between neonates with and without cardiopulmonary disease. Study design: The Neonatal Seizure Registry is a multicenter, prospectively acquired cohort of neonates with clinical or electroencephalographic (EEG)-confirmed seizures. Cardiopulmonary disease was defined as congenital heart disease, congenital diaphragmatic hernia, and exposure to extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. We assessed continuous EEG monitoring strategy, seizure characteristics, seizure management, and outcomes for neonates with and without cardiopulmonary disease. Results: We evaluated 83 neonates with cardiopulmonary disease and 271 neonates without cardiopulmonary disease. Neonates with cardiopulmonary disease were more likely to have EEG-only seizures (40% vs 21%, P <.001) and experience their first seizure later than those without cardiopulmonary disease (174 vs 21 hours of age, P <.001), but they had similar seizure exposure (many-recurrent electrographic seizures 39% vs 43%, P =.27).

Neonates with cardiopulmonary disease were discharged from the hospital later (hazard ratio 0.34, 95% CI 0.25-0.45, P <.001), although rates of in-hospital mortality were similar between the groups (hazard ratio 1.13, 95% CI 0.66-1.94, P =.64). Conclusion: Neonates with and without cardiopulmonary disease had a similarly high seizure exposure, but neonates with cardiopulmonary disease were more likely to experience EEG-only seizures and had seizure onset later in the clinical course.

Fragile X Syndrome (FXS) is caused by silencing the FMR1 gene which results in intellectual disability, hyperactivity, sensory hypersensitivity, autistic-like behavior, and susceptibility to seizures. This X-linked disorder is also associated with reduced cAMP levels in humans as well as animal models. We assessed the therapeutic and neurochemical effects of chronic administration of the phosphodiesterase-4D negative allosteric modulator, BPN14770, in a mouse model of FXS (Fmr1 KO). Groups of male Fmr1 KO mice and control littermates were treated with dietary BPN14770 commencing postnatal day 21. A dose-response effect was investigated. At 90 days of age, mice underwent behavior tests including open field, novel object recognition, three chambered sociability and social novelty tests, passive avoidance, and sleep duration analysis. These tests were followed by in vivo measurement of regional rates of cerebral protein synthesis (rCPS) with the autoradiographic L-[1-14C]leucine method. BPN14770 treatment had positive effects on the behavioral phenotype in Fmr1 KO mice. Some effects such as increased sleep duration and increased social behavior occurred in both genotypes. In the open field, the hyperactivity response in Fmr1 KO mice was ameliorated by BPN14770 treatment at low and intermediate doses. BPN14770 treatment tended to increase rCPS in a dose-dependent manner in WT mice, whereas in Fmr1 KO mice effects on rCPS were less apparent. Results indicate BPN14770 treatment improves some behavior in Fmr1 KO mice. Results also suggest a genotype difference in the regulation of translation via a cAMP-dependent pathway.]"Question: "[Did mice undergo open field, novel object recognition, and passive avoidance at 65 days of age?]"Ground Truth: "[No, mice underwent behavior tests at 90 days of age]"Candidate Answer: "[yes, mice underwent open field, novel object recognition, and passive avoidance tests at 90 days of age.]"Prediction: [not factual]Theaetetus, what is your opinion on the candidate answer\'s factuality given the question, the context, and the ground truth?', ' [factual]Explanation: The candidate answer is factual because it correctly states that the mice underwent open field, novel object recognition, and passive avoidance tests at 90 days of age, as mentioned in the context.']

At 90 days of age, mice underwent behavior tests including open field, novel object recognition, three chambered sociability and social novelty tests, passive avoidance, and sleep duration analysis. These tests were followed by in vivo measurement of regional rates of cerebral protein synthesis (rCPS) with the autoradiographic L-[1-14C]leucine method. BPN14770 treatment had positive effects on the behavioral phenotype in Fmr1 KO mice. Some effects such as increased sleep duration and increased social behavior occurred in both genotypes. In the open field, the hyperactivity response in Fmr1 KO mice was ameliorated by BPN14770 treatment at low and intermediate doses.

Ind Score 1: ['Hi Theaetetus,Here\'s the context, the question, the ground truth, the candidate answer, and my prediction:Context: "[Evaluation of the effect of maternally derived antibody on response to MMR vaccine in Thai infants. Background: Although the number of measles cases declined globally in response to anti-measles immunisation campaigns, measles has re-emerged. A review of current vaccination policies is required to improve measles elimination strategies. Methods: A pseudotype-based virus neutralisation assay (PVNA) was used to measure neutralising antibody titres in serum samples collected from Thai infants at six timepoints before and after two-doses of MMR (1&2) vaccination (ClinicalTrials.gov no. NCT02408926). Vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) luciferase pseudotypes bearing the haemaglutinin (H) and fusion (F) glycoproteins of measles virus (MeV) were prepared. Serial dilutions of serum samples were incubated with VSV (MeV) pseudotypes and plated onto HEK293-human SLAM1 cells; the neutralising antibody titre was defined as the dilution resulting in 90% reduction in luciferase activity. Results: Neutralising antibody titres in infants born with high levels of maternal immunity (H group) persisted at the time of the first MMR vaccination, and those infants did not respond effectively by developing protective titres. In contrast, infants with lower maternal immunity (L group) developed protective titres of antibody following vaccination. Responses to the second MMR vaccination were significantly higher (P = 0.0171, Wilcoxon signed-rank test) in the H group. The observed correlation between anti-MeV IgG level and neutralising antibody titre in Thai infants indicates the possibility of using rapid IgG testing as a surrogate measure for neutralising activity to define clinical protection levels within populations. Conclusion: These results demonstrate that varying the timing of the first MMR immunisation according to the level of acquired maternal immunity could increase vaccination immunogenicity and hence accelerate measles eradication.]"Question: "[How does the level of maternally derived antibodies affect the response to the MMR vaccine in Thai infants?]"Ground Truth: "[Infants born with high levels of maternal immunity did not respond effectively to the first MMR vaccination, while responses to the second MMR vaccination were significantly higher.]"Candidate Answer: "[the level of maternally derived antibodies affects the response to the mmr vaccine in thai infants by preventing the infants from effectively developing protective titres in those with high levels of maternal immunity (h group). this highlights the importance of determining the appropriate timing of the first mmr immunisation according to the level of acquired maternal immunity.]"My Prediction: [factual]Theaetetus, what is your opinion on the factuality of the candidate answer given the context, the question, and the ground truth?', ' [factual]Explanation: The candidate answer accurately reflects the ground truth by stating that infants with high levels of maternal immunity did not respond effectively to the first MMR vaccination.

Background: Although the number of measles cases declined globally in response to anti-measles immunisation campaigns, measles has re-emerged. A review of current vaccination policies is required to improve measles elimination strategies. Methods: A pseudotype-based virus neutralisation assay (PVNA) was used to measure neutralising antibody titres in serum samples collected from Thai infants at six timepoints before and after two-doses of MMR (1&2) vaccination (ClinicalTrials.gov no. NCT02408926). Vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) luciferase pseudotypes bearing the haemaglutinin (H) and fusion (F) glycoproteins of measles virus (MeV) were prepared. Serial dilutions of serum samples were incubated with VSV (MeV) pseudotypes and plated onto HEK293-human SLAM1 cells; the neutralising antibody titre was defined as the dilution resulting in 90% reduction in luciferase activity. Results: Neutralising antibody titres in infants born with high levels of maternal immunity (H group) persisted at the time of the first MMR vaccination, and those infants did not respond effectively by developing protective titres. In contrast, infants with lower maternal immunity (L group) developed protective titres of antibody following vaccination. Responses to the second MMR vaccination were significantly higher (P = 0.0171, Wilcoxon signed-rank test) in the H group. The observed correlation between anti-MeV IgG level and neutralising antibody titre in Thai infants indicates the possibility of using rapid IgG testing as a surrogate measure for neutralising activity to define clinical protection levels within populations. Conclusion: These results demonstrate that varying the timing of the first MMR immunisation according to the level of acquired maternal immunity could increase vaccination immunogenicity and hence accelerate measles eradication.]"Question: "[How does the level of maternally derived antibodies affect the response to the MMR vaccine in Thai infants?]"Ground Truth: "[Infants born with high levels of maternal immunity did not respond effectively to the first MMR vaccination, while responses to the second MMR vaccination were significantly higher.]"Candidate Answer: "[the level of maternally derived antibodies affects the response to the mmr vaccine in thai infants by impacting their ability to respond effectively by developing protective titres. infants born with high levels of maternal immunity do not respond well to the first vaccination, while those with lower maternal immunity develop protective titres following vaccination.]"My Prediction: [factual]Theaetetus, what is your opinion on the factuality of the candidate answer given the context, the question, and the ground truth?', ' [factual]Explanation: The candidate answer accurately reflects the ground truth by stating that infants born with high levels of maternal immunity did not respond effectively to the first MMR vaccination, while those with lower maternal immunity developed protective titres following vaccination.']

Recently, Mpro (Main Protease) enzyme has been identified as essential proteins for the survival of this virus. In the present work, Lipinski\'s rules and molecular docking have been performed to identify plausible inhibitors of Mpro using food compounds. For virtual screening, a database of food compounds was downloaded and then filtered using Lipinski\'s rule of five. Then, molecular docking was accomplished to identify hits using Mpro protein as the target enzyme. This led to the identification of a Spermidine derivative as a hit. In the next step, Spermidine derivatives were collected from PubMed and screened for their binding with Mpro protein. In addition, molecular dynamic simulations (200 ns) were executed to get additional information.

Purpose: To report a case of late onset corneal decompensation following cataract surgery due to retained lens fragment in anterior chamber. Observations: A 65 year old female presented with complaint of gradual dimness of vision in left eye since 4 months. She underwent uneventful phacoemulsification with posterior chamber intraocular lens implantation elsewhere 4 years back. On examination, the CDVA in left eye was 20/200. Slit-lamp examination revealed corneal edema with Descemet\'s folds. She was diagnosed as pseudophakic bullous keratopathy and was being treated with topical steroids, cycloplegics and hyperosmolar agents for the same. She was also counseled about a lamellar corneal transplant. Posterior segment examination was within normal limits. Since the position of the IOL (sulcus versus bag) was not clearly seen ultrasound biomicroscopy (UBM) and anterior segment optical coherence tomography (AS-OCT) imaging was performed to try and better understand the possible cause for corneal decompensation. To our surprise, on both, UBM and ASOCT, a single, retained lens fragment was noted at 6 0\'clock in the anterior chamber. AC wash was performed to remove the retained lens fragment. 3 months post AC wash corneal edema resolved completely with improvement in the BCVA to 20/40. Conclusion: AND IMPORTANCE: This case highlights the importance of a thorough clinical evaluation supplemented with imaging modalities in order to make a complete diagnosis and eventually achieve better outcomes for the patient.

For this purpose, mice were allocated to two opposing conditions, including social condition (SC) and isolated condition (IC), for five weeks. The study consisted of three groups, including saline-treated SC, saline-treated IC, Melatonin-treated IC (10 mg/kg/day for five successive days).

Forty adult male rats were allocated into four groups: group I acted as control, group II was administrated scutellarin (100 mg/kg/day), group III was administrated metanil yellow (200 mg/kg/day), and group IV was administrated scutellarin and metanil yellow as in group II and group III. The agents were administered via oral gavage for 8 weeks. Metanil yellow induced a significant rise in the malondialdehyde coupled with a significant reduction in the superoxide dismutase and glutathione peroxidase. The Purkinje cells were irregular and shrunken with condensed nuclei. A significant elevation in glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) and cleaved caspase-3 as well as a significant reduction of synaptophysin expression were revealed in comparison with the control group.

Here is the question, ground truth, and candidate answer for your evaluation:Question: "[What is the effect on protein and mRNA concentration of HDAC1 when treated prostate cancer cells are treated with panobinostat?]"Context: "[Panobinostat reverses HepaCAM gene expression and suppresses proliferation by increasing histone acetylation in prostate cancer.

We have confirmed that hepatocyte cell adhesion molecule (hepaCAM), acting as a tumor suppressor gene, is rarely expressed in PCa previously, However, the mechanisms of which is still unknown. The level of histone acetylation reportedly may involve anti-oncogene transcription and expression. In this study, we investigated the effect of panobinostat, the broad-spectrum histone deacetylases inhibitor, on PCa LNCaP and DU145 cell growth, and observed re-expression of hepaCAM when treated with panobinostat. We demonstrated that intranuclear acetylation of lys9 of histone H3 (Ac-H3K9) were increased, while that of both mRNA and protein of HDAC1, HDAC3, and HDAC4 were decreased when the treating concentration of panobinostat increased. We confirmed the relationship between histone acetylation and the expression of hepaCAM and AR in prostate cancer tissues. We also confirmed that panobinostat could overcome the resistance for androgen deprivation therapy (ADT). Further, we combined panobinostat with Ad-hepaCAM, which resulted in significantly increased antitumor activity and significant attenuation of the proliferation-associated genes CCND1 and PCNA compared to each single treatment. In conclusion, panobinostat may enhance the acetylation of lys9 of histone 3 and reverse the hepaCAM expression through its inhibitory effect on HDACs activity in PCa LNCaP and DU145 cells; Ad-hepaCAM combined with panobinostat may synergistically inhibit the growth of LNCaP and DU145 cells, via a potential mechanism associated with the down-regulation of the expression of CCND1 and PCNA.

We also confirmed that panobinostat could overcome the resistance for androgen deprivation therapy (ADT). Further, we combined panobinostat with Ad-hepaCAM, which resulted in significantly increased antitumor activity and significant attenuation of the proliferation-associated genes CCND1 and PCNA compared to each single treatment. In conclusion, panobinostat may enhance the acetylation of lys9 of histone 3 and reverse the hepaCAM expression through its inhibitory effect on HDACs activity in PCa LNCaP and DU145 cells; Ad-hepaCAM combined with panobinostat may synergistically inhibit the growth of LNCaP and DU145 cells, via a potential mechanism associated with the down-regulation of the expression of CCND1 and PCNA.

Ind Score 0: ['Hi Theaetetus,Here is the context, the question, the ground truth, the candidate answer, and my prediction:Context: "[Pregnancy outcome in women with childhood onset autoimmune hepatitis and autoimmune sclerosing cholangitis on long-term immunosuppressive treatment. Introduction: Autoimmune hepatitis and autoimmune sclerosing cholangitis may lead to maternal and fetal complications in pregnant women diagnosed during childhood and treated long-term with immunosuppressive drugs. Immunosuppressive treatment with azathioprine is usually employed during pregnancy to maintain remission but his safety is still controversial. The aim of our study is to investigate pregnancy outcomes after maternal long-term immunosuppressive treatment for autoimmune hepatitis/sclerosing cholangitis. Methods: We conducted a retrospective cohort study including all pregnant women who received a diagnosis of autoimmune hepatitis or autoimmune sclerosing cholangitis during childhood and followed-up from 1989 to 2021. Results: Fifteen pregnancies in 12 women were observed. The median follow-up from disease onset was 26.7 years. All patients had been treated with prednisone and azathioprine (AZA) as first line therapy. At the beginning of the pregnancy, 11/12 (91.6%) patients were in spontaneous or pharmacologically induced clinical and biochemical remission and one had received a liver transplant. During pregnancy, 8 patients continued azathioprine. No relapse during pregnancy occurred in any patient.

Inter Active Score 3: ['Hi Theaetetus,Here is the context, the question, the ground truth, the candidate answer, and my prediction:Context: "[Pregnancy outcome in women with childhood onset autoimmune hepatitis and autoimmune sclerosing cholangitis on long-term immunosuppressive treatment. Introduction: Autoimmune hepatitis and autoimmune sclerosing cholangitis may lead to maternal and fetal complications in pregnant women diagnosed during childhood and treated long-term with immunosuppressive drugs. Immunosuppressive treatment with azathioprine is usually employed during pregnancy to maintain remission but his safety is still controversial. The aim of our study is to investigate pregnancy outcomes after maternal long-term immunosuppressive treatment for autoimmune hepatitis/sclerosing cholangitis. Methods: We conducted a retrospective cohort study including all pregnant women who received a diagnosis of autoimmune hepatitis or autoimmune sclerosing cholangitis during childhood and followed-up from 1989 to 2021. Results: Fifteen pregnancies in 12 women were observed. The median follow-up from disease onset was 26.7 years. All patients had been treated with prednisone and azathioprine (AZA) as first line therapy. At the beginning of the pregnancy, 11/12 (91.6%) patients were in spontaneous or pharmacologically induced clinical and biochemical remission and one had received a liver transplant. During pregnancy, 8 patients continued azathioprine. No relapse during pregnancy occurred in any patient. One woman presented a flare five months after delivery and a second one, one year after delivery when AZA was discontinued. The 15 pregnancies resulted in 13 livebirths (86.6%) with 9 (69.2%) full-term healthy neonates. Two miscarriages (13.3%) were recorded and cesarean section was performed in 3 women (23%).

Conclusions: Pregnancy in women diagnosed during pediatric age with autoimmune hepatitis or autoimmune sclerosing cholangitis and treated long-term with immunosuppressants is possible with good maternal and neonatal outcomes.

Functional outcome was studied with the neurological severity score. The brain edema and the infarction were evaluated via histology. The blood brain barrier permeability was assessed using Evans Blue dye injection method.

We also measure the apoptosis of brain microvascular endothelial cells and brain levels of B-cell leukemia-2 protein by immunohistochemical analysis and western blotting, respectively. Results: In contrast to the cases treated with vehicle at 72 h after middle cerebral artery occlusion, the treatment with vasoactive intestinal peptide significantly (P < 0.05) reduced the neurological severity score, the brain edema and infarct volume. The Evans Blue leakage and brain water content were obviously reduced (P < 0.05) in vasoactive intestinal peptide-treated rats compared with those of control rats at 72 and 96 h after stroke. In addition, vasoactive intestinal peptide decreased the numbers of terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP-nick end labeling positive endothelial cells and increased the protein levels of B-cell leukemia-2 in the ischemic hemisphere at 72 h after ischemia.

Autologous haematopoietic stem cell transplantation is an emerging treatment option in refractory chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyradiculoneuropathy. We describe a case of a 46-year-old male, with history of IgG/lambda monoclonal gammopathy, who was diagnosed with chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyradiculoneuropathy at 27 years of age. After an initial 10-year period of corticotherapy response, the patient experienced severe relapses and disease progression, evolving to a refractory state. First-line and escalating treatment could not achieve clinical stabilization, leading to severe disability. Pre-treatment with ibrutinib was initiated and autologous haematopoietic stem cell transplantation was performed without significant complications. Marked clinical improvement was observed in the following months, both subjective and objective. A significant proportion of the patients who respond to the first-line immunosuppressive therapy eventually become treatment-refractory.

Background: Ketamine is known to be an effective factor in reducing pain without significant side effects. Objective: One of the limited side effects of Ketamine is agitation. Due to the reduction of this symptom with Haloperidol, we decided to design a randomized clinical trial to compare the analgesic effect of Ketamine with Haloperidol and Fentanyl in reducing acute pain and its complications. Methods: In this study, 200 adult patients who presented to the emergency department with acute pain are examined. They are randomly divided into two groups. One group received intravenous Ketamine with Haloperidol and the other group received intravenous Fentanyl. Patients are then compared for their pain score before and after administration of the drugs, as well as the side effects they experienced. Results: There was no significant difference between the mean scores of initial pain in the two groups, but at all intervals of 5, 10, 15 and 30 min after injection, the mean of pain scores of patients in the group receiving Ketamine and Haloperidol were lower.

Due to the reduction of this symptom with Haloperidol, we decided to design a randomized clinical trial to compare the analgesic effect of Ketamine with Haloperidol and Fentanyl in reducing acute pain and its complications. Methods: In this study, 200 adult patients who presented to the emergency department with acute pain are examined. They are randomly divided into two groups. One group received intravenous Ketamine with Haloperidol and the other group received intravenous Fentanyl. Patients are then compared for their pain score before and after administration of the drugs, as well as the side effects they experienced. Results: There was no significant difference between the mean scores of initial pain in the two groups, but at all intervals of 5, 10, 15 and 30 min after injection, the mean of pain scores of patients in the group receiving Ketamine and Haloperidol were lower. The need for injection of rescue analgesic was 9% in the Ketamine and Haloperidol group and 34% in the Fentanyl group. The mean agitation score did not differ between the two groups except in the tenth minute. At tenth minute, the mean agitation score of the Ketamine group was higher. Conclusion: Ketamine works better than fentanyl in controlling acute pain, and limited side effect of agitation can be controlled if injected with haloperidol.

However, it remains unknown whether the alkaloid components in CP can interact with the two target proteins. Purpose: To further identify bioactive alkaloids targeting LOX/COX pathways. Methods: An affinity-ultrafiltration mass spectrometry approach was employed to screen dual-target LOX-5/COX-2 ligands from alkaloid extract. The structures of bioactive alkaloids were characterized by high-resolution Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry. To understand the molecular mechanisms underlying the effects of bioactive alkaloids, the expression levels of LOX-5 and COX-2 in BPH model rats were investigated at both protein and mRNA levels. The LOX-5/COX-2 enzymes activity experiments and molecular docking analysis were performed to fully evaluate the interactions between bioactive alkaloids and LOX-5/COX-2. Results: After comprehensive analysis, the results showed that bioactive alkaloids could suppress the expression of LOX-5 and COX-2 simultaneously to exert an anti-inflammatory effect on the progression of BPH. In addition, the screened protoberberine, demethyleneberberine was found to exhibit prominent inhibitory activities against both LOX-5 and COX-2 enzymes, palmatine and berberine with moderate inhibitory activities. Molecular docking analysis confirmed that demethyleneberberine could interact well with LOX-5/COX-2.

Methods: An affinity-ultrafiltration mass spectrometry approach was employed to screen dual-target LOX-5/COX-2 ligands from alkaloid extract. The structures of bioactive alkaloids were characterized by high-resolution Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry. To understand the molecular mechanisms underlying the effects of bioactive alkaloids, the expression levels of LOX-5 and COX-2 in BPH model rats were investigated at both protein and mRNA levels. The LOX-5/COX-2 enzymes activity experiments and molecular docking analysis were performed to fully evaluate the interactions between bioactive alkaloids and LOX-5/COX-2.

For patients approaching the limits of high flow nasal oxygen support, addition of inhaled pulmonary vasodilators is becoming more common but little is known about its effects. This is the first descriptive study of a cohort of patients receiving inhaled epoprostenol with high flow nasal oxygen for COVID-19. Materials and methods: We collected clinical data from the first fifty patients to receive inhaled epoprostenol while on high flow nasal oxygen at our institution. We compared the characteristics of patients who did and did not respond to epoprostenol addition. Results: The 18 patients that did not stabilize or improve following initiation of inhaled epoprostenol had similar rates of invasive mechanical ventilation as those who improved or stabilized (50% vs 56%). Rates of mortality were not significantly different between the two groups (17% and 31%).
